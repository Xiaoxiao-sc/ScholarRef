"recent years have seen an increasing interest in the authoring and crafting of personal visualizations. mainstream data analysis and authoring tools lack the flexibility for customization and personalization, whereas tools from the research community either require creativity and drawing skills, or are limited to simple vector graphics. we present dataquilt, a novel system that enables visualization authors to iteratively design pictorial visualizations as collages. real images (e.g., paintings, photographs, sketches) act as both inspiration and as a resource of visual elements that can be mapped to data. the creative pipeline involves the semi-guided extraction of relevant elements of an image (arbitrary regions, regular shapes, color palettes, textures) aided by computer vision techniques; the binding of these graphical elements and their features to data in order to create meaningful visualizations; and the iterative refinement of both features and visualizations through direct manipulation. we demonstrate the usability of dataquilt in a controlled study and its expressiveness through a collection of authored visualizations from a second open-ended study.","other devices instrument on-body touch surfaces through wearable fingertip devices, clothing, or touchable tattoos.","skin-based touch input opens up new opportunities for direct, subtle, and expressive interaction. however, existing skin-worn sensors are restricted to single-touch input and limited by a low resolution. we present the first skin overlay that can capture high-resolution multi-touch input. our main contributions are: 1) based on an exploration of functional materials, we present a fabrication approach for printing thin and flexible multi-touch sensors for on-skin interactions. 2) we present the first non-rectangular multi-touch sensor overlay for use on skin and introduce a design tool that generates such sensors in custom shapes and sizes. 3) to validate the feasibility and versatility of our approach, we present four application examples and empirical results from two technical evaluations. they confirm that the sensor achieves a high signal-to-noise ratio on the body under various grounding conditions and has a high spatial accuracy even when subjected to strong deformations.",769.0,32.0,138.0
"k-8 mathematics students must learn many procedures, such as addition and subtraction. students frequently learn ""buggy' variations of these procedures, which we ideally could identify automatically. this is challenging because there are many possible variations that reflect deep compositions of procedural thought. existing approaches for k-8 math use manually specified variations which do not scale to new math algorithms or previously unseen misconceptions. our system examines students' answers and infers how they incorrectly combine basic skills into complex procedures. we evaluate this approach on data from approximately 300 students. our system replicates 86% of the answers that contain clear systematic mistakes (13%). investigating further, we found 77% at least partially replicate a known misconception, with 53% matching exactly. we also present data from 29 participants showing that our system can demonstrate inferred incorrect procedures to an educator as successfully as a human expert.","propose an interactive voice forum as an anonymous and private way for low-income, low-literate women in pakistan to share experiences around mental health.","this paper explores the opportunities and challenges in designing peer-support mechanisms for low-income,low-literate women in pakistan, a patriarchal and religious context where women's movements, social relationsand access to digital technologies are restricted. through a qualitative, empirical study with 21 participantswe examine the cultural and patriarchal framework where shame and fear of defamation restrict the seekingof support for personal narratives around taboo subjects like abortion, sexual harassment, rape and domesticabuse. based on our qualitative data we also conduct a second qualitative study using a technology probe with15 low-income, low-literate women to explore the specific design of peer-support technologies for supportseeking and the sharing of sensitive and taboo narratives in a deeply patriarchal society. the design concernsraised by our participants regarding privacy, anonymity and safety provide cscw researchers with valuableguidelines about designing for social connections and support for vulnerable populations within a particularcontext.",262.0,1011.0,13063.0
"the number of sensors in our surroundings that provide the same information steadily increases. since sensing is prone to errors, sensors may disagree. for example, a gps-based tracker on the phone and a sensor on the bike wheel may provide discrepant estimates on traveled distance. this poses a user dilemma, namely how to reconcile the conflicting information into one estimate. we investigated whether visualizing the uncertainty associated with sensor measurements improves the quality of users' inference. we tested four visualizations with increasingly detailed representation of uncertainty. our study repeatedly presented two sensor measurements with varying degrees of inconsistency to participants who indicated their best guess of the ""true"" value. we found that uncertainty information improves users' estimates, especially if sensors differ largely in their associated variability. improvements were larger for information-rich visualizations. based on our findings, we provide an interactive tool to select the optimal visualization for displaying conflicting information.","in particular, conversational programmers found that these programming learning resources didn't align with their needs: instruction focused too much on syntax and logic, and not enough on how to apply code to solve problems.","conversational programmers represent a class of learners who are not required to write any code, yet try to learn programming to improve their participation in technical conversations. we carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. however, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. our findings point to design opportunities in hci to invent learner-centered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.",502.0,508.0,3210.0
"users interact with many reconfigurable objects in daily life. these objects embed reconfigurations and shape- changing features that users are familiar with. for this reason, everyday reconfigurable objects have informed the design and taxonomy of shape changing ui. however, they have never been explored systematically. in this paper, we present a data set of 82 everyday reconfigurable objects that we collected in a workshop. we discuss how they can inspire the design of reconfigurable interfaces. we particularly focus on taxonomies of reconfigurable interfaces. taxonomies have been suggested to help design and communication among researchers, however despite their extensive use, taxonomies are rarely evaluated. this paper analyses two established taxonomies - rasmussen's and roudaut's - using daily reconfigurable objects. we show relationships between the taxonomies and area for improvements. we propose morphees+, a refined taxonomy based on roudaut's shape resolution taxonomy.","[8] demonstrated that when compared to traditional layouts, torus-based node-link diagram layouts reduce the number of link crossings, reduce stress and increase incidence angle of links entering a node.","we investigate visualisations of networks on a 2-dimensional torus topology, like an opened-up and flattened doughnut. that is, the network is drawn on a rectangular area while ""wrapping"" specific links around the border. previous work on torus drawings of networks has been mostly theoretical, limited to certain classes of networks, and not evaluated by human readability studies. we offer a simple interactive layout approach applicable to general graphs. we use this to find layouts affording better aesthetics in terms of conventional measures like more equal edge length and fewer crossings. in two controlled user studies we find that torus layout with either additional context or interactive panning provided significant performance improvement (in terms of error and time) over torus layout without either of these improvements, to the point that it is comparable to standard non-torus layout.",616.0,777.0,28352.0
"as online platforms increasingly collect large amounts of data about their users, there has been growing public concern about privacy around issues such as data sharing. controversies around practices perceived as surprising or even unethical often highlight patterns of privacy attitudes when they spark conversation in the media. this paper examines public reaction ""in the wild"" to two data sharing controversies that were the focus of media attention-regarding the social media and communication services facebook and whatsapp, as well as the email service unroll.me. these controversies instigated discussion of data privacy and ethics, accessibility of website policies, notions of responsibility for privacy, cost-benefit analyses, and strategies for privacy management such as non-use. an analysis of reactions and interactions captured by comments on news articles not only reveals information about pervasive privacy attitudes, but also suggests communication and design strategies that could benefit both platforms and users.","examples include behavioral visualization webtools that help create a shared understanding of developmentally delayed patients’ behaviors in parent-provider communication (e.g., engaze and plexline) and a visual display tool that enhances the providers’ self-awareness of their non-verbal communication through ambient visual feedback based on a real-time social signal processing of a video feed from the patient and provider's conversation (e.g., entendre).","effective communication between clinicians and parents of young children with developmental delays can decrease parents' anxiety, help them handle bad news, and improve their adherence to proposed interventions. however, parents have reported dissatisfaction regarding their current communication with clinicians, and they face cognitive and emotional challenges when discussing their child's developmental delays. in this paper, we present visualization as a facilitator of parent-clinician communication and how it could address existing communication challenges. parents and clinicians anticipated visualization webtools would aid their communication by helping parents gain a better understanding of their child, acting as objective evidence, and highlighting the strength of the child as well as important medical concepts. in addition, visualization can act as a longitudinal record, helping parents track, explore, and share their child's developmental progress. finally, we propose visualization as a tool to guide parents in their transition from feeling emotional and disempowered to advocating with confidence.",52.0,778.0,40624.0
"while domestic abuse is an all too common experience for women worldwide, how people experience the abuse and their resources to deal with the abuse differ. in this qualitative, interview-based study, we examine saudi women's domestic safety concerns living in saudi arabia and the united states. based on non-western islamic feminist views of agency, we identify three key practices, focused on how women resist or deal with their domestic violence. for each practice, we highlight how interwoven cultural, religious, and political contexts impact saudi women's ability to recognize and deal with domestic abuse. we attend to technology's role in enabling or hindering women's agency. these practices include: 1) recognizing abuse, where women identify abusive situations, 2) managing abuse, where women find ways to cope with ongoing or anticipated abuse within their constraints and resources, and 3) seeking non-abusive futures, where women decide how to mitigate the abuse or leave their abuser. given domestic violence's complicated nature, we highlight several key design recommendations based on women's values.","through these field observations, the researchers contribute a set of design principles in the form of implications for system design and game design patterns that enable designers to develop training games and simulations that engage players in disaster-response-style planning.","in distributed multiplayer games, it can be difficult to communicate strategic information for planning game moves and player interactions. often, players spend extra time communicating, reducing their engagement in the game. visual annotations in game maps and in the gameworld can address this problem and result in more efficient player communication. we studied the impact of real-time feedback on planning annotations, specifically two different annotation types, in a custom-built, third-person, multiplayer game and analyzed their effects on player performance, experience, workload, and annotation use. we found that annotations helped engage players in collaborative planning, which reduced frustration, and shortened goal completion times. based on these findings, we discuss how annotating in virtual game spaces enables collaborative planning and improves team performance.",1031.0,312.0,8481.0
"the richness that characterizes relationships is often absent when they are modeled using computational methods in network science. typically, relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. the lack of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to categorize relationships. here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. we first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. these ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. we also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. overall, by proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking applications.",several participants went a step further and exhibited the tendency to blame themselves based on perceptions regarding typically expected privacy-related practices:,"privacy and surveillance are central features of public discourse around use of computing systems. as the systems we design and study are increasingly used and regulated as potential instruments of surveillance, hci researchers-even those whose focus is not privacy-find themselves needing to understand privacy in their work. concepts like contextual integrity and boundary regulation have become touchstones for thinking about privacy in hci. in this paper, we draw on hci and privacy literature to understand the limitations of commonly used theories and examine their assumptions, politics, strengths, and weaknesses. we use a case study from the hci literature to illustrate conceptual gaps in existing frameworks where privacy requirements can fall through. finally, we advocate vulnerability as a core concept for privacy theorizing and examine how feminist, queer-marxist, and intersectional thinking may augment our existing repertoire of privacy theories to create a more inclusive scholarship and design practice.",810.0,764.0,33879.0
"digitally presenting physiological signals as biofeedback to users raises awareness of both body and mind. this paper describes the effectiveness of conveying a physiological signal often overlooked for communication: breathing. we present the design and development of digital breathing patterns and their evaluation along three output modalities: visual, audio, and haptic. we also present breeze, a wearable pendant placed around the neck that measures breathing and sends biofeedback in real-time. we evaluated how the breathing patterns were interpreted in a fixed environment and gathered qualitative data on the wearable device's design. we found that participants intentionally modified their own breathing to match the biofeedback, as a technique for understanding the underlying emotion. our results describe how the features of the breathing patterns and the feedback modalities influenced participants' perception. we include guidelines and suggested use cases, such as breeze being used by loved ones to increase connectedness and empathy.","likewise, this gradual accumulation of visualizations from different rounds of prompts also can be used for a collective visual summarization of lectures.","while video has become a widely adopted medium for online learning, existing video players provide limited support for navigation and learning. it is difficult to locate parts of the video that are linked to specific concepts. also, most video players afford passive watching, thus making it difficult for learners with limited metacognitive skills to deeply engage with the content and reflect on their understanding. to support concept-driven navigation and comprehension of lecture videos, we present conceptscape, a system that generates and presents a concept map for lecture videos. conceptscape engages crowd workers to collaboratively generate a concept map by prompting them to externalize reflections on the video. we present two studies to show that (1) interactive concept maps can be useful tools for concept-based video navigation and comprehension, and (2) with conceptscape, novice crowd workers can collaboratively generate complex concept maps that match the quality of those by experts.",642.0,385.0,6201.0

"accurately and efficiently crowdsourcing complex, open-ended tasks can be difficult, as crowd participants tend to favor short, repetitive ""microtasks"". we study the crowdsourcing of large networks where the crowd provides the network topology via microtasks. crowds can explore many types of social and information networks, but we focus on the network of causal attributions, an important network that signifies cause-and-effect relationships. we conduct experiments on amazon mechanical turk (amt) testing how workers can propose and validate individual causal relationships and introduce a method for independent crowd workers to explore large networks. the core of the method, iterative pathway refinement, is a theoretically-principled mechanism for efficient exploration via microtasks. we evaluate the method using synthetic networks and apply it on amt to extract a large-scale causal attribution network. worker interactions reveal important characteristics of causal perception and the generated network data can help improve our understanding of causality and causal inference.","here, prior work looked into the use of wearable sensor devices, e.g., smart glasses in public spaces, lifelogging, and ubiquitous sensing in smart home applications.","as the internet of things (iot) devices make their ways into people's homes, traditional dwellings are turning into smart homes. while prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. we conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. we identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). we highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. we discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes.",792.0,879.0,38215.0
"while prior research has revealed the promising impact of concept mapping on learning, few have comprehensively modeled different cognitive behaviors during concept mapping. in addition, existing concept mapping tools lack effective feedback to support better learning behaviors. this work presents minddot, a concept map-based learning environment that facilitates the cognitive process of comparing and integrating related concepts via two forms of support. a hyperlink support and an expert template. study results suggested that both types of support had positive impact on the development of comparative strategies and that hyperlink support enhanced learning. we further evaluated the cognitive learning progress at a fine-grained level with two forms of visualizations. we then extracted several behavioral patterns that provided insights about the cognitive progress in learning. lastly, we derive design recommendations that we hope will inspire future intelligent tutoring systems that automatically evaluate students' learning behaviors and foster them in developing effective learning behaviors","in the game context, previous studies have found that wearables can be perceived as costumes by players, increasing the strength of the bond between players and their avatars.","we believe that wearables and movement are perfect fit for enhancing tabletop role-playing (ttrpg) experience, since they can provide embodied interaction, are perceived as character-costumes, enhance ludic properties and increase the connectedness to the imaginary game worlds. by providing these improvements, they can increase the immersiveness and player/character relationship which are critical for an ideal ttrpg experience. to investigate this underexplored area, we conducted an extensive research through design process which includes a (1) participatory design workshop with 25 participants, (2) preliminary user tests with wizard-of-oz and experience prototypes with 15 participants, (3) production of a new game system, wearable and tangible artifacts and (4) summative user tests for understanding the effects on experience with 16 participants. as a result of our study, we extracted design guidelines about how to integrate wearables and movement in narrative-based tabletop games and communicate how the results of each phase affected our artifacts.",692.0,510.0,26926.0

"driving is a task that is often affected by emotions. the effect of emotions on driving has been extensively studied. anger is an emotion that dominates in such investigations. despite the knowledge on strong links between scents and emotions, few studies have explored the effect of olfactory stimulation in a context of driving. such an outcome provides hci practitioners very little knowledge on how to design for emotions using olfactory stimulation in the car. we carried out three studies to select scents of different valence and arousal levels (i.e. rose, peppermint, and civet) and anger eliciting stimuli (i.e. affective pictures and on-road events). we used this knowledge to conduct the fourth user study investigating how the selected scents change the emotional state, well-being, and driving behaviour of drivers in an induced angry state. our findings enable better decisions on what scents to choose when designing interactions for angry drivers.","even though our work presents techniques that are particularly relevant for data visualization, recent concepts for 3d modeling and architecture or sketching show the applicability to other use cases.","we present symbiosissketch, a hybrid sketching system that combines drawing in air (3d) and on a drawing surface (2d) to create detailed 3d designs of arbitrary scale in an augmented reality (ar) setting. symbiosissketch leverages the complementary affordances of 3d (immersive, unconstrained, life-sized) and 2d (precise, constrained, ergonomic) interactions for in situ 3d conceptual design. a defining aspect of our system is the ongoing creation of surfaces from unorganized collections of 3d curves. these surfaces serve a dual purpose: as 3d canvases to map strokes drawn on a 2d tablet, and as shape proxies to occlude the physical environment and hidden curves in a 3d sketch. symbiosissketch users draw interchangeably on a 2d tablet or in 3d within an ergonomically comfortable canonical volume, mapped to arbitrary scale in ar. our evaluation study shows this hybrid technique to be easy to use in situ and effective in transcending the creative potential of either traditional sketching or drawing in air.",773.0,183.0,28531.0

"similar to a design process for designing graphical user interfaces, conversation designers often apply an iterative design process by defining a conversation flow, testing with users, reviewing user data, and improving the design. while it is possible to iterate on conversation design with existing chatbot prototyping tools, there still remain challenges in recruiting participants on-demand and collecting structured feedback on specific conversational components. these limitations hinder designers from running rapid iterations and making informed design decisions. we posit that involving a crowd in the conversation design process can address these challenges, and introduce protochat, a crowd-powered chatbot design tool built to support the iterative process of conversation design. protochat makes it easy to recruit crowd workers to test the current conversation within the design tool. protochat's crowd-testing tool allows crowd workers to provide concrete and practical feedback and suggest improvements on specific parts of the conversation. with the data collected from crowd-testing, protochat provides multiple types of visualizations to help designers analyze and revise their design. through a three-day study with eight designers, we found that protochat enabled an iterative design process for designing a chatbot. designers improved their design by not only modifying the conversation design itself, but also adjusting the persona and getting ui design implications beyond the conversation design itself. the crowd responses were helpful for designers to explore user needs, contexts, and diverse response formats. with protochat, designers can successfully collect concrete evidence from the crowd and make decisions to iteratively improve their conversation design.","this is in contrast to current projects, such as those in digital fabrication, that assume more linear workflows: artists might start with a digital design tool, then use an existing program to compile it into machine code, and then fabricate it.","low-cost fabrication machines (e.g., 3d printers) offer the promise of creating custom-designed objects by a range of users. to maximize performance, generative design methods such as topology optimization can automatically optimize properties of a design based on high-level specifications. though promising, such methods require people to map their design ideas--often unintuitively--to a small number of mathematical input parameters, and the relationship between those parameters and a generated design is often unclear, making it difficult to iterate a design. we present forte, a sketch-based, real-time interactive tool for people to directly express and iterate on their designs via 2d topology optimization. users can ask the system to add structures, provide a variation with better performance, or optimize internal material layouts. users can globally control how much to 'deviate' from the initial sketch, or perform local suggestive editing, which interactively prompts the system to update based on the new information. design sessions with 10 participants demonstrate that forte empowers designers to create and explore a range of optimized designs with custom forms and styles.",1032.0,493.0,18802.0
"race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of classification in technical infrastructures-from the passport to social media. facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. what facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. in this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. we found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. we discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. we posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. we conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications.","live streamers in other domains have also leveraged live streaming to connect and engage community members, such as for performance (e.g., singing), education, knowledge sharing, programming, cultural practices, and creative activities.","despite gaining traction in north america, live streaming has not reached the popularity it has in china, where live- streaming has a tremendous impact on the social behaviors of users. to better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in china. we present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. we also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. we also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.",942.0,463.0,7862.0
"collaborative qualitative coding often involves coders assign- ing different labels to the same instance, leading to ambiguity. we refer to such an instance of ambiguity as disagreement in coding. analyzing reasons for such a disagreement is essential-- both for purposes of bolstering user understanding gained from coding and reinterpreting the data collaboratively, and for negotiating user-assigned labels for building effective machine learning models. we propose a conceptual definition of collective disagreement using diversity and divergence within the coding distributions. this perspective of disagreement translates to diverse coding contexts and groups of coders irrespective of discipline. we introduce two tree-based ranking metrics as standardized ways of comparing disagreements in how data instances have been coded. we empirically validate that, of the two tree-based metrics, coders' perceptions of dis- agreement match more closely with the n-ary tree metric than with the post-traversal tree metric.","self-tracking is then seen as a possible way to directly control individuals’ fertility trajectories, a belief that is largely influenced by societal views of healthcare (e.g., one needs to take responsibility for their health) and expectations about gender (e.g., women are responsible for conceiving).","self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. we explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. we qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. we found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. we discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. we also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area.",158.0,807.0,11921.0

"remote collaborations are becoming ubiquitous, but, despite their many advantages, face unique challenges compared to collocated collaborations. visualizing the collaborator's point of gaze on a shared screen has been explored as a promising way to alleviate some of these limitations by increasing shared awareness. however, prior studies on shared gaze have not considered the medium of communication and have only studied its effect on audio. this paper presents a study that compares the effects of shared gaze on collaboration performance during audio- and text-based communication. we find that for text, shared gaze improved task correctness and led collaborators to look at and talk more about shared content. similar trends are found for gaze-augmented voice communication, but contrary to the slower performance in text, it also saw improvements in completion time as well as in cognitive workload. our findings demonstrate the differences in how shared gaze impacts audio- versus text-based communication and highlight the need to further understand the nuances of the medium of communication when designing novel tools to support remote collaborators.","in the literature we find many examples of designing for breathing feedback in visual or aural form, or even, in some cases, using haptic feedback through different tangible media, such as shape-changing materials.","attending to breath is a self-awareness practice that exists within many contemplative and reflective traditions and is recognized for its benefits to well-being. our current technological landscape embraces a large body of systems that utilize breath data in order to foster self-awareness. this paper seeks to deepen our understanding of the design space of systems that perceptually extend breath awareness. our contribution is twofold: (1) our analysis reveals how the underlying theoretical frameworks shape the system design and its evaluation, and (2) how system design features support perceptual extension of breath awareness. we review and critically analyze 31 breath-based interactive systems. we identify 4 theoretical frameworks and 3 design strategies for interactive systems that perceptually extend breath awareness. we reflect upon this design space from both a theoretical and system design perspective, and propose future design directions for developing systems that ""listen to"" breath and perceptually extend it.",1001.0,780.0,15693.0

"continuous 'pseudocolor' maps visualize how a quantitative attribute varies smoothly over space. these maps are widely used by experts and lay citizens alike for communicating scientific and geographical data. a critical challenge for designers of these maps is selecting a color scheme that is both effective and aesthetically pleasing. although there exist empirically grounded guidelines for color choice in segmented maps (e.g., choropleths), continuous maps are significantly understudies, and their color-coding guidelines are largely based on expert opinion and design heuristics--many of these guidelines have yet to be verified experimentally. we conducted a series of crowdsourced experiments to investigate how the perception of continuous maps is affected by colormap characteristics and spatial frequency (a measure of data complexity). we find that spatial frequency significantly impacts the effectiveness of color encodes, but the precise effect is task-dependent. while rainbow schemes afforded the highest accuracy in quantity estimation irrespective of spatial complexity, divergent colormaps significantly outperformed other schemes in tasks requiring the perception of high-frequency patterns. we interpret these results in relation to current practices, and devise new and more granular guidelines for color mapping in continuous maps.","this work is related to a larger body of studies on ml work practices of specific groups of practitioners, including software engineers using ml, non-expert ml users, as well as specific aspects of work practices, such as model interpretation and iterative behavior in ml development.","as the use of machine learning (ml) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. while scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like hci, ml, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. this lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. to bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ml models. the characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. we present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.",270.0,952.0,4656.0

"on live streams, viewers can support streamers through various methods ranging from well-wishing text messages to money. in this study (n=230) we surveyed viewers who had given money to a streamer. we identified six motivations for why they gave money to their favorite live streamer. we then examined how factors related to viewer, streamer, and viewer-streamer interaction were associated with three forms of social support provision: emotional, instrumental, and financial support. our main findings are: parasocial relationship was consistently correlated with all three types of social support, while social presence was only related with instrumental and financial support; interpersonal attractiveness was associated with emotional and instrumental support and lonely people were more likely to give instrumental support. our focus on various types of social support in a live streaming masspersonal platform adds a more detailed understanding to the existing literature of mediated social support. furthermore, it suggests potential directions for designing more supportive and interactive live streaming platforms.","of course, inaccurate recommendations can be frustrating to users, so providing users the ability to opt out of suggestions is important.","advertisers develop algorithms to select the most relevant advertisements for users. however, the opacity of these algorithms, along with their potential for violating user privacy, has decreased user trust and preference in behavioral advertising. to mitigate this, advertisers have started to communicate algorithmic processes in behavioral advertising. however, how revealing parts of the algorithmic process affects users' perceptions towards ads and platforms is still an open question. to investigate this, we exposed 32 users to why an ad is shown to them, what advertising algorithms infer about them, and how advertisers use this information. users preferred interpretable, non-creepy explanations about why an ad is presented, along with a recognizable link to their identity. we further found that exposing users to their algorithmically-derived attributes led to algorithm disillusionment---users found that advertising algorithms they thought were perfect were far from it. we propose design implications to effectively communicate information about advertising algorithms.",471.0,429.0,2019.0

"social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. for example, blue feed, red feed, a news feed created by the wall street journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. to combat the spread of fake news, facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. to systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. we found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption.","as mcdonald and forte note, each definition of privacy is political, thus necessitating a careful examination of the choices underlying its characterization.","privacy and surveillance are central features of public discourse around use of computing systems. as the systems we design and study are increasingly used and regulated as potential instruments of surveillance, hci researchers-even those whose focus is not privacy-find themselves needing to understand privacy in their work. concepts like contextual integrity and boundary regulation have become touchstones for thinking about privacy in hci. in this paper, we draw on hci and privacy literature to understand the limitations of commonly used theories and examine their assumptions, politics, strengths, and weaknesses. we use a case study from the hci literature to illustrate conceptual gaps in existing frameworks where privacy requirements can fall through. finally, we advocate vulnerability as a core concept for privacy theorizing and examine how feminist, queer-marxist, and intersectional thinking may augment our existing repertoire of privacy theories to create a more inclusive scholarship and design practice.",822.0,764.0,33815.0

"whereas social visual attention has been examined in computer-mediated (e.g., shared screen) or video-mediated (e.g., facetime) interaction, it has yet to be studied in mixed-media interfaces that combine video of the conversant along with other ui elements. we analyzed eye gaze of 37 dyads (74 participants) who were tasked with negotiating the price of a new car (as a buyer and seller) using mixed-media video conferencing under competitive or cooperative negotiation instructions (experimental manipulation). we used multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to extract spatio-temporal patterns corresponding to mutual gaze (individuals look at each other), joint attention (individuals focus on the same elements of the interface), and gaze aversion (an individual looks at their partner, who is looking elsewhere). our results indicated that joint attention predicted the sum of points attained by the buyer and seller (i.e., the joint score). in contrast, gaze aversion was associated with faster time to complete the negotiation, but with a lower joint score. unexpectedly, mutual gaze was highly infrequent and unrelated to the negotiation outcomes and none of the gaze patterns predicted subjective perceptions of the negotiation. there were also no effects of gender composition or negotiation condition on the gaze patterns or negotiation outcomes. our results suggest that social visual attention may operate differently in mixed-media collaborative interfaces than in face-to-face interaction. as mixed-media collaborative interfaces gain prominence, our work can be leveraged to inform the design of gaze-sensitive user interfaces that support remote negotiations among other tasks.","morpheesplug is comprised of three main components: (1) a set of 3d-printable, inflatable widgets that can represent seven out of eleven of the morphees+ features ; (2) a design environment for makers to model scis; (3) a control module responsible for actuating scis widgets.","users interact with many reconfigurable objects in daily life. these objects embed reconfigurations and shape- changing features that users are familiar with. for this reason, everyday reconfigurable objects have informed the design and taxonomy of shape changing ui. however, they have never been explored systematically. in this paper, we present a data set of 82 everyday reconfigurable objects that we collected in a workshop. we discuss how they can inspire the design of reconfigurable interfaces. we particularly focus on taxonomies of reconfigurable interfaces. taxonomies have been suggested to help design and communication among researchers, however despite their extensive use, taxonomies are rarely evaluated. this paper analyses two established taxonomies - rasmussen's and roudaut's - using daily reconfigurable objects. we show relationships between the taxonomies and area for improvements. we propose morphees+, a refined taxonomy based on roudaut's shape resolution taxonomy.",1067.0,616.0,5830.0

"expert disagreement is pervasive in clinical decision making and collective adjudication is a useful approach for resolving divergent assessments. prior work shows that expert disagreement can arise due to diverse factors including expert background, the quality and presentation of data, and guideline clarity. in this work, we study how these factors predict initial discrepancies in the context of medical time series analysis, examining why certain disagreements persist after adjudication, and how adjudication impacts clinical decisions. results from a case study with 36 experts and 4,543 adjudicated cases in a sleep stage classification task show that these factors contribute to both initial disagreement and resolvability, each in their own unique way. we provide evidence suggesting that structured adjudication can lead to significant revisions in treatment-relevant clinical parameters. our work demonstrates how structured adjudication can support consensus and facilitate a deep understanding of expert disagreement in medical data analysis.","searching examples, support, and documentation, such as which code apis to use and how to use them, is one vital activity for developers using notebooks, as well as other development tools.","computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. we present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. in the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on github, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. in a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. in a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. these studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. we conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.",896.0,31.0,18496.0
"algorithmic systems---from rule-based bots to machine learning classifiers---have a long history of supporting the essential work of content moderation and other curation work in peer production projects. from counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency. however, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. in this paper, we describe ores: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ores decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. this meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithms in wikipedia to a broader set of participants. in this paper, we discuss the theoretical mechanisms of social change ores enables and detail case studies in participatory machine learning around ores from the 5 years since its deployment.","prior work found that ml interpretability seeks to establish trust not only between humans and models, but also between humans.","as the use of machine learning (ml) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. while scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like hci, ml, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. this lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. to bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ml models. the characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. we present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.",1013.0,952.0,4675.0

"biosensing displays, increasingly enrolled in emotional reflection, promise authoritative insight by presenting users' emotions as discrete categories. rather than machines interpreting emotions, we sought to explore an alternative with emotional biosensing displays in which users formed their own interpretations and felt comfortable critiquing the display. so, we designed, implemented, and deployed, as a technology probe, an emotional biosensory display: ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes color responding to the wearer's skin conductance, which is associated with excitement. 17 participants wore ripple over 2 days of daily life. while some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' ripple provided between body and emotion, for others ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had. despite our design intentions, we found participants rarely questioned the display's relation to their feelings. using biopolitics to speculate on ripple's surprising authority, we highlight ethical stakes of biosensory representations for sense of self and ways of feeling.","the majority of prior work uses a simple approach in which textures are either fully saturated or fully desaturated (e.g., photochromic carpet, colormod).","recent research has shown how to change the color of existing objects using photochromic materials. these materials can switch their appearance from transparent to colored when exposed to light of a certain wavelength. the color remains even when the object is removed from the light source. the process is fully reversible allowing users to recolor the object as many times as they want. so far, these systems have been limited to single color changes, i.e. changes from transparent to colored. in this paper, we present colormod, a method to extend this approach to multi-color changes (e.g., red-to-yellow). we accomplish this using a multi-color pattern with one color per voxel across the surface of the object. when recoloring the object, our system locally activates only those voxels that have the desired color and turns all other voxels off. we describe colormod's hardware/software system and its user interface that comes with a conversion tool for 3d printing as well as a painting tool that matches physical voxels with the desired appearance. we also contribute our own material formula for a 3d-printable photochromic ink.",428.0,211.0,40836.0

"evaluations of technological artifacts in hci4d contexts are known to suffer from high levels of participant response bias---where participants only provide positive feedback that they think will please the researcher. this paper describes a practical, low-cost intervention that uses the concept of social proof to influence participant response bias and successfully elicit critical feedback from study participants. we subtly exposed participants to feedback that they perceived to be provided by people 'like them', and experimentally controlled the tone and content of the feedback to provide either positive, negative, or no social proof. we then measured how participants' quantitative and qualitative evaluations of an hci artifact changed based on the feedback to which they were exposed. we conducted two controlled experiments: an online experiment with 245 mturk workers and a field experiment with 63 women in rural india. our findings reveal significant differences between participants in the positive, negative, and no social proof conditions, both online and in the field. participants in the negative condition provided lower ratings and a greater amount of critical feedback, while participants in the positive condition provided higher ratings and a greater amount of positive feedback. taken together, our findings demonstrate that social proof is a practical and generalizable technique that could be used by hci researchers to influence participant response bias in a wide range of contexts and domains.","similarity attraction effects have also been seen in in-car voice assistants, whereby users liked and trusted the assistant more if their personalities were matched.","this paper investigates personalized voice characters for in-car speech interfaces. in particular, we report on how we designed different personalities for voice assistants and compared them in a real world driving study. voice assistants have become important for a wide range of use cases, yet current interfaces are using the same style of auditory response in every situation, despite varying user needs and personalities. to close this gap, we designed four assistant personalities (friend, admirer, aunt, and butler) and compared them to a baseline (default) in a between-subject study in real traffic conditions. our results show higher likability and trust for assistants that correctly match the user's personality while we observed lower likability, trust, satisfaction, and usefulness for incorrectly matched personalities, each in comparison with the default character. we discuss design aspects for voice assistants in different automotive use cases.",549.0,704.0,15051.0
"while much popular discussion of representation in games exists, there is very little rigorously collected data available from which to draw direct conclusions. in this study, we set out to address this gap by performing a census of playable characters across a large sample of contemporary games. we gathered data from 200 games including independently published (""indie"") games and so-called ""aaa"" titles from large publishers. while our initial analysis yielded some insight into the landscape of playable characters, it also highlighted the contingent, negotiated, and interpretive nature of representation in games. this led to additional analysis that emphasized the ways in which this negotiation manifests in research in the methods and metrics used to quantify representation. we argue that researchers studying representation in games need to treat it as a possibility space for a multitude of potential interpretations rather than a singular, measurable, phenomenon.","a variety of techniques use this “palette and brush” metaphor, which enables users to leverage their proprioceptive senses to locate their non-dominant hand in 3d space without needing to explicitly search for the menu.","eyes-free target acquisition is a basic and important human ability to interact with the surrounding physical world, relying on the sense of space and proprioception. in this research, we leverage this ability to improve interaction in virtual reality (vr), by allowing users to acquire a virtual object without looking at it. we expect this eyes-free approach can effectively reduce head movements and focus changes, so as to speed up the interaction and alleviate fatigue and vr sickness. we conduct three lab studies to progressively investigate the feasibility and usability of eyes-free target acquisition in vr. results show that, compared with the eyes-engaged manner, the eyes-free approach is significantly faster, provides satisfying accuracy, and introduces less fatigue and sickness; most participants (13/16) prefer this approach. we also measure the accuracy of motion control and evaluate subjective experience of users when acquiring targets at different locations around the body. based on the results, we make suggestions on designing appropriate target layout and discuss several design issues for eyes-free target acquisition in vr.",92.0,41.0,7091.0
"sensor-enabled computers in the form of 'iot' devices such as home security cameras and voice assistants are increasingly becoming pervasive in our environment. with the embedded cameras and microphones in these devices, this 'invasion' of our everyday spaces can pose significant threats to the privacy of bystanders. because of their complex functionality, even when people attempt privacy measures (such as asking the owner to ""turn the camera off""), these devices may still record information because of the lack of a 'real' off button. with the ambiguities of current designs, a bystander's perceived privacy can diverge from their actual privacy. indeed, being able to assess one's actual privacy is a key aspect in managing one's privacy according to altman's theory of boundary regulation, and current designs fall short in assuring people of their privacy. to understand how people as bystanders manage their privacy with iot devices, we conducted an interview study about people's perceptions of and behaviors around current iot devices. we find that although participants' behaviors line up with altman's theory of boundary regulation, in the face of uncertainty about their privacy, they desire or engage in various 'tangible' workarounds. based on our findings, we identify and introduce the concept of 'tangible privacy' as being essential to boundary regulation with iot devices. we argue that iot devices should be designed in a way that clearly and unambiguously conveys sensor states to people around them and make actionable design recommendations to provide strong privacy assurances to bystanders.","for example, the design choices “consent wall” and “reduced service”—while relying upon the dark patterns of obstruction and forced action—are not included in pre-existing categorizations of dark patterns, as defined by others, but rather they emerged from a discussion between legal experts, designers, and computer scientists who are the authors of this paper.","interest in critical scholarship that engages with the complexity of user experience (ux) practice is rapidly expanding, yet the vocabulary for describing and assessing criticality in practice is currently lacking. in this paper, we outline and explore the limits of a specific ethical phenomenon known as ""dark patterns,"" where user value is supplanted in favor of shareholder value. we assembled a corpus of examples of practitioner-identified dark patterns and performed a content analysis to determine the ethical concerns contained in these examples. this analysis revealed a wide range of ethical issues raised by practitioners that were frequently conflated under the umbrella term of dark patterns, while also underscoring a shared concern that ux designers could easily become complicit in manipulative or unreasonably persuasive practices. we conclude with implications for the education and practice of ux designers, and a proposal for broadening research on the ethics of user experience.",981.0,531.0,10117.0

"in this paper, we study online privacy lies: lies primarily aimed at protecting privacy. going beyond privacy lenses that focus on privacy concerns or cost/benefit analyses, we explore how contextual factors, motivations, and individual-level characteristics affect lying behavior through a 356-person survey. we find that statistical models to predict privacy lies that include attitudes about lying, use of other privacy-protective behaviors (ppbs), and perceived control over information improve on models based solely on self-expressed privacy concerns. based on a thematic analysis of open-ended responses, we find that the decision to tell privacy lies stems from a range of concerns, serves multiple privacy goals, and is influenced by the context of the interaction and attitudes about the morality and necessity of lying. together, our results point to the need for conceptualizations of privacy lies-and ppbs more broadly-that account for multiple goals, perceived control over data, contextual factors, and attitudes about ppbs.","in one simulated replay study of typing common phrases on a watch-sized keyboard, assuming perfect word deliminator input, vertanen and colleagues demonstrated that phrase-level decoding could reduce the character error rate (cer) from 2.3% to 1.8%.","entering text on non-desktop computing devices is often done via an onscreen virtual keyboard. input on such keyboards normally consists of a sequence of noisy tap events that specify some amount of text, most commonly a single word. but is single word-at-a-time entry the best choice? this paper compares user performance and recognition accuracy of word-at-a-time, phrase-at-a-time, and sentence-at-a-time text entry on a smartwatch keyboard. we evaluate the impact of differing amounts of input in both text copy and free composition tasks. we found providing input of an entire sentence significantly improved entry rates from 26 wpm to 32 wpm while keeping character error rates below 4%. in offline experiments with more processing power and memory, sentence input was recognized with a much lower 2.0% error rate. our findings suggest virtual keyboards can enhance performance by encouraging users to provide more input per recognition event.",51.0,623.0,11502.0

"in many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. however, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). in this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the united states (48.8% women) on upwork, a popular gig work platform. the median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. however, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. to better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities.","many of the early work in this space, such as marking menus and its adaptations, such as hierarchical marking menus, wave menus, flower menus, wavelet menus, markpad, imaginary gestures, and m3 gesture menu, requires the user to memorize the mapping between a command and its corresponding gesture, thus making it hard for novice users to adopt.","despite their learning advantages in theory, marking menus have faced adoption challenges in practice, even on today's touchscreen-based mobile devices. we address these challenges by designing, implementing, and evaluating multiple versions of m3 gesture menu (m3), a reimagination of marking menus targeted at mobile interfaces. m3 is defined on a grid rather than in a radial space, relies on gestural shapes rather than directional marks, and has constant and stationary space use. our first controlled experiment on expert performance showed m3 was faster and less error-prone by a factor of two than traditional marking menus. a second experiment on learning demonstrated for the first time that users could successfully transition to recall-based execution of a dozen commands after three ten-minute practice sessions with both m3 and multi-stroke marking menu. together, m3, with its demonstrated resolution, learning, and space use benefits, contributes to the design and understanding of menu selection in the mobile-first era of end-user computing.",820.0,247.0,11451.0
"hci researchers work within spaces of possibility for potential designs of technology. new methods (e.g., user centrism); expected types of interaction (user with device); and potential applications (urban navigation) can extend the boundaries of these possibilities. however, structural and systemic factors can also foreclose them. a recent wide and shallow survey of 116 individuals involved in technology development across 26 countries in sub-saharan africa reveals how factors of political economy significantly impact upon technological possibilities. monopolies, international power dynamics, race, and access to capital open or constrain technological possibilities at least as much as device-centric or user-focused constraints do. though their thrust may have been anticipated by reference to political economic trends, the structural constraints we found were underestimated by technologists even a decade ago. we discuss the implications for technology development in africa and beyond.","in live streaming, viewer interactions have facilitated engagement, the sense of community, and exchange of information.","live streaming, which allows streamers to broadcast their work to live viewers, is an emerging practice for teaching and learning computer programming. participation in live streaming is growing rapidly, despite several apparent challenges, such as a general lack of training in pedagogy among streamers and scarce signals about a stream's characteristics (e.g., difficulty, style, and usefulness) to help viewers decide what to watch. to understand why people choose to participate in live streaming for teaching or learning programming, and how they cope with both apparent and non-obvious challenges, we interviewed 14 streamers and viewers about their experience with live streaming programming. among other results, we found that the casual and impromptu nature of live streaming makes it easier to prepare than pre-recorded videos, and viewers have the opportunity to shape the content and learning experience via real-time communication with both the streamer and each other. nonetheless, we identified several challenges that limit the potential of live streaming as a learning medium. for example, streamers voiced privacy and harassment concerns, and existing streaming platforms do not adequately support viewer-streamer interactions, adaptive learning, and discovery and selection of streaming content. based on these findings, we suggest specialized tools to facilitate knowledge sharing among people teaching and learning computer programming online, and we offer design recommendations that promote a healthy, safe, and engaging learning environment.",304.0,1066.0,6152.0

"conventional hearing aids frame hearing impairment almost exclusively as a problem. in the present paper, we took an alternative approach by focusing on positive future possibilities of 'divergent hearing'. to this end, we developed a method to speculate simultaneously about not-yet-experienced positive meanings and not-yet-existing technology. first, we gathered already existing activities in which divergent hearing was experienced as an advantage rather than as a burden. these activities were then condensed into 'prompts of positive possibilities' (ppp), such as 'creating a shelter to feel safe in"". in performative sessions, participants were given these ppps and 'open probes' to enact novel everyday activities. this led to 26 possible meanings and according devices, such as ""being able to listen back into the past with a rewinder"". the paper provides valuable insights into the interests and expectations of people with divergent hearing as well as a methodological contribution to a possibility-driven design.","this work is related to a larger body of studies on ml work practices of specific groups of practitioners, including software engineers using ml, non-expert ml users, as well as specific aspects of work practices, such as model interpretation and iterative behavior in ml development.","successful machine learning (ml) applications require iterations on both modeling and the underlying data. while prior visualization tools for ml primarily focus on modeling, our interviews with 23 ml practitioners reveal that they improve model performance frequently by iterating on their data (e.g., collecting new data, adding labels) rather than their models. we also identify common types of data iterations and associated analysis tasks and challenges. to help attribute data iterations to model performance, we design a collection of interactive visualizations and integrate them into a prototype, chameleon, that lets users compare data features, training/testing splits, and performance across data versions. we present two case studies where developers apply \system to their own evolving datasets on production ml projects. our interface helps them verify data collection efforts, find failure cases stretching across data versions, capture data processing changes that impacted performance, and identify opportunities for future data iterations.",693.0,774.0,4656.0
"understanding the roles of social factors in online purchase behavior has been a long standing research problem. the recently emerging social e-commerce platforms leverage the stimulated word-of-mouth effect to promote the sales of items, which offers a peek into the complex interplay between the social influence and online purchasing behavior. in this paper, we investigate this problem on a full-scale purchase behavior dataset from one of the leading social e-commerce platforms, beidian. specifically, we conduct a comparison study between the social e-commerce and conventional e-commerce that are both integrated in beidian to examine how social factors affect user's purchase behavior. we reveal that social e-commerce leads to a 3.09~10.37 times higher purchase conversion rate compared with the conventional settings, which indicates users make purchase with significantly fewer item explorations. then, we propose and validate four primary mechanisms that contribute to the efficient purchase conversion: better matching, social enrichment, social proof and price sensitivity. moreover, we identify several behavioral indicators that are able to measure the effect of these mechanisms, based on which we design an accurate predictive model (auc=0.7738) for user's purchase decision. these results combine to shed light on how to understand and model the purchase behavior in social e-commerce.","investigating the role of digital technologies in the challenges of not only migrating but also settling, studies have found phones to play a crucial if unsurprising role, and are used, for example, for the translation and learning of unfamiliar languages or staying in touch with family.","framed within the theoretical lens of positive and negative security, this paper presents a study of newcomers to sweden and the roles of mobile phones in the establishment of a new life. using creative engagement methods through a series of workshops, two researchers engaged 70 adult participants enrolled into further education colleges in sweden. group narratives about mobile phone use were captured in creative outputs, researcher observations and notes and were analysed using thematic analysis. key findings show that the mobile phone offers security for individuals and a safe space for newcomers to establish a new life in a new land as well as capitalising on other spaces of safety, such as maintaining old ties. this usage produces a series of threats and vulnerabilities beyond traditional technological security thinking related to mobile phone use. the paper concludes with recommendations for policies and support strategies for those working with newcomers.",885.0,581.0,18216.0

"augmentative and alternative communication (aac) technologies are widely used to help non-verbal children enable communication. for aac-aided communication to be successful, caregivers should support children with consistent intervention strategies in various settings. as such, caregivers need to continuously observe and discuss children's aac usage to create a shared understanding of these strategies. however, caregivers often find it challenging to effectively collaborate with one another due to a lack of family involvement and the unstructured process of collaboration. to address these issues, we present talkingboogie, which consists of two mobile apps: talkingboogie-aac for caregiver-child communication, and talkingboogie-coach supporting caregiver collaboration. working together, these applications provide contextualized layouts for symbol arrangement, scaffold the process of sharing and discussing observations, and induce caregivers' balanced participation. a two-week deployment study with four groups (n=11) found that talkingboogie helped increase mutual understanding of strategies and encourage balanced participation between caregivers with reduced cognitive loads.","researchers have taken this approach in various domains; for example, the target property could be the balancing capability of 3d printed objects or the user performance in graphical user interface.","the mission of animators is to create nuanced, high-quality character motions. to achieve this, the careful editing of animation curves---curves that determine how a series of keyframed poses are interpolated over time---is an important task. manual editing affords full and precise control, but requires tedious and nonintuitive trials and errors. numerical optimization can automate such exploration; however, automatic solutions cannot always be perfect, and it is difficult for animators to control optimization owing to its black-box behavior. in this paper, we present a new framework called optimization-guided motion editing, which is aimed at maintaining a sense of full control while utilizing the power of optimization. we have designed interactions and developed a set of mathematical formulations to enable them. we discuss the framework's potential by demonstrating several usage scenarios with our proof-of-concept system, named optimo.",751.0,160.0,17034.0

"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.","therefore, with rfibricks, a uhf rfid tag was modified into contact switches.","we present rfibricks, an interactive building block system based on ultrahigh frequency radio-frequency identification (rfid) sensing. the system enables geometry resolution based on a simple yet highly generalizable mechanism: an rfid contact switch, which is made by cutting each rfid tag into two parts, namely antenna and chip. a magnetic connector is then coupled with each part. when the antenna and chip connect, an interaction event with an id is transmitted to the reader. on the basis of our design of rfid contact switch patterns, we present a system of interactive physical building blocks that resolves the stacking order and orientation when one block is stacked upon another, determines a three-dimensional (3d) geometry built on a two-dimensional base plate, and detects user inputs by incorporating electromechanical sensors. because it is calibration-free and does not require batteries in each block, it facilitates straightforward maintenance when deployed at scale. compared with other approaches, this rfid-based system resolves several critical challenges in human-computer interaction, such as 1) determining the identity and the built 3d geometry of passive building blocks, 2) enabling stackable token+constraint interaction on a tabletop, and 3) tracking in-hand assembly.",882.0,187.0,30492.0

"video summaries are a popular way to share important events, but creating good summaries is hard. it requires expertise in both capturing and editing footage. while hiring a professional videographer is possible, this is too costly for most casual events. an alternative is to place 360 video cameras around an event space to capture footage passively and then extract regular field-of-view (rfov) shots for the summary. this paper focuses on the problem of extracting such rfov shots. since we cannot actively control the cameras or the scene, it is hard to create ""ideal' shots that adhere strictly to traditional cinematography rules. to better understand the tradeoffs, we study human preferences for static and moving camera rfov shots generated from 360 footage. from the findings, we derive design guidelines. as a secondary contribution, we use these guidelines to develop automatic algorithms that we demonstrate in a prototype user interface for extracting rfov shots from 360 videos.","as part of these investigations, our work will also contribute to related initiatives which argue that the game design community needs to move past considering the human body as a controller to play with, and toward embracing the human body as play.","games research in hci is continually interested in the human body. however, recent work suggests that the field has only begun to understand how to design bodily games. we propose that the games research field is advancing from playing with digital content using a keyboard, to using bodies to play with digital content, towards a future where we experience our bodies as digital play. to guide designers interested in supporting players to experience their bodies as play, we present two phenomenological perspectives on the human body (körper and leib) and articulate a suite of design tactics using our own and other people's work. we hope with this paper, we are able to help designers embrace the point that we both ""have"" a body and ""are"" a body, thereby aiding the facilitation of the many benefits of engaging the human body through games and play, and ultimately contributing to a more humanized technological future.",314.0,208.0,26306.0
"there is a risk that modern practices of information communication and visualization in human-computer interaction can sideline communities due to their prioritization of scientific rationality. such ideological hegemony can complicate interactions with data and computers, especially for low-literate communities in the global south. through a six-month long ethnographic study with nakshi-katha makers, hindu idol makers, and witchcraft practitioners, we investigated how rural practitioners use their own forms of representation and narrative in record keeping, social and religious storytelling, and information mediated decision making. we find that traditionally developed approaches towards presenting and communicating information often make use of concrete units to represent entities and connect to designers' cultural practices and the physical location. further, we identify how medium has significant influence in meaning-making. often these strategies and conventions are passed down through generations within the community. in this paper, we discuss how this rural tradition differs from the modern information communication practices, discussing how an understanding of traditional practices for representing information can be useful in developing more accessible, and culturally appropriate modern tools and technologies for the people of rural bangladesh and similar communities.","for instance, a couple that has experienced pregnancy loss might not want to see posts related to babies temporarily, even when they are posted by close friends.","pregnancy loss is a common experience that is often not disclosed in spite of potential disclosure benefits such as social support. to understand how and why people disclose pregnancy loss online, we interviewed 27 women in the u.s. who are social media users and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. we developed a decision-making framework explaining pregnancy loss disclosures on identified social network sites (sns) such as facebook. we introduce network-level reciprocal disclosure, a theory of how disclosure reciprocity, usually applied to understand dyadic exchanges, can operate at the level of a social network to inform decision-making about stigmatized disclosures in identified snss. we find that 1) anonymous disclosures on other sites help facilitate disclosure on identified sites (e.g., facebook), and 2) awareness campaigns enable sharing about pregnancy loss for many who would not disclose otherwise. finally, we discuss conceptual and design implications. caution: this paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.",1021.0,157.0,24607.0
"in recent years, research has revealed gender biases in numerous software products. but although some researchers have found ways to improve gender participation in specific software projects, general methods focus mainly on detecting gender biases -- not fixing them. to help fill this gap, we investigated whether the gendermag bias detection method can lead directly to designs with fewer gender biases. in our 3-step investigation, two hci researchers analyzed an industrial software product using gendermag; we derived design changes to the product using the biases they found; and ran an empirical study of participants using the original product versus the new version. the results showed that using the method in this way did improve the software's inclusiveness: women succeeded more often in the new version than in the original; men's success rates improved too; and the gender gap entirely disappeared.",other visualization systems explored sketching as an activity for sense-making and data exploration .,"during sensemaking, people annotate insights: underlining sentences in a document or circling regions on a map. they jot down their hypotheses: drawing correlation lines on scatterplots or creating personal legends to track patterns. we present activeink, a system enabling people to seamlessly transition between exploring data and externalizing their thoughts using pen and touch. activeink enables the natural use of pen for active reading behaviors, while supporting analytic actions by activating any of these ink strokes. through a qualitative study with eight participants, we contribute observations of active reading behaviors during data exploration and design principles to support sensemaking.",717.0,706.0,25964.0

"pointing at remote objects to direct others' attention is a fundamental human ability. previous work explored methods for remote pointing to select targets. absolute pointing techniques that cast a ray from the user to a target are affected by humans' limited pointing accuracy. recent work suggests that accuracy can be improved by compensating systematic offsets between targets a user aims at and rays cast from the user to the target. in this paper, we investigate mid-air pointing in the real world and virtual reality. through a pointing study, we model the offsets to improve pointing accuracy and show that being in a virtual environment affects how users point at targets. in the second study, we validate the developed model and analyze the effect of compensating systematic offsets. we show that the provided model can significantly improve pointing accuracy when no cursor is provided. we further show that a cursor improves pointing accuracy but also increases the selection time.","[52], follow the ”what you experience is what you get” (wyxiwyg) editor principle from lee et al.","designers have limited tools to prototype ar experiences rapidly. can lightweight, immediate tools let designers prototype dynamic ar interactions while capturing the nuances of a 3d experience? we interviewed three ar experts and identified several recurring issues in ar design: creating and positioning 3d assets, handling the changing user position, and orchestrating multiple animations. we introduce project pronto, a tablet-based video prototyping system that combines 2d video with 3d manipulation. pronto supports four intertwined activities: capturing 3d spatial information alongside a video scenario, positioning and sketching 2d drawings in a 3d world, and enacting animations with physical interactions. an observational study with professional designers shows that participants can use pronto to prototype diverse ar experiences. all participants performed two tasks: replicating a sample non-trivial ar experience and prototyping their open-ended designs. all participants completed the replication task and found pronto easy to use. most participants found that pronto encourages more exploration of designs than their current practices.",650.0,757.0,27567.0

"the rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. this paper contributes to such research in two ways. first, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. second, through a controlled experimental study on amazon mechanical turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. we studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. these results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.",a large body of research emphasizes the importance of shared or common identity through communication within online communities.,"research questions about community among online learners are gaining importance as enrollments in online programs explode. however, what community means for this context has not been studied in a comprehensive way. we contribute a quantitative study of learners' feelings and behavior expectations about online community, adapting scales for sense of community (soc) and developing an instrument to assess community collective efficacy (cce). our analysis of students' responses to these scales revealed two factors underlying soc (shared identity and interpersonal friendship) and three factors underlying cce (identity regulation, coordination and social support). we used these factors to discuss contrasting definitions of community (shared identity versus ego networks). exploratory data analyses also revealed relationships to other student variables that begin to articulate roles and mechanisms for online students' felt community, and raise design implications about what we might do with and for the community structure.",870.0,290.0,19783.0

"in recent years, the entity--component--system pattern has become a fundamental feature of the software architectures of game-development environments such as unity and unreal, which are used extensively in developing 3d user interfaces. in these systems, ui components typically respond to events, requiring programmers to write application-specific callback functions. in some cases, components are organized in a hierarchy that is used to propagate events among vertically connected components. when components need to communicate horizontally, programmers must connect those components manually and register/unregister events as needed. moreover, events and callback signatures may be incompatible, making modular uis cumbersome to build and share within or across applications. to address these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, mercury, to facilitate communication among components. we provide an overview of mercury, outline its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using relay nodes, describe a reference implementation in unity, and present example systems built using mercury to explain its advantages.","technology design could also support the connections among physical components in the hybrid setup, such as an augmented physical dice that changes the color of its embedded led light for different players’ turns.","we believe that wearables and movement are perfect fit for enhancing tabletop role-playing (ttrpg) experience, since they can provide embodied interaction, are perceived as character-costumes, enhance ludic properties and increase the connectedness to the imaginary game worlds. by providing these improvements, they can increase the immersiveness and player/character relationship which are critical for an ideal ttrpg experience. to investigate this underexplored area, we conducted an extensive research through design process which includes a (1) participatory design workshop with 25 participants, (2) preliminary user tests with wizard-of-oz and experience prototypes with 15 participants, (3) production of a new game system, wearable and tangible artifacts and (4) summative user tests for understanding the effects on experience with 16 participants. as a result of our study, we extracted design guidelines about how to integrate wearables and movement in narrative-based tabletop games and communicate how the results of each phase affected our artifacts.",585.0,510.0,26340.0

"women gig workers face unique challenges in on-demand platforms as gendered aspects of class, caste, and labor participation intersect with moments of control experienced on the job. through in-depth interviews with 19 beauty workers on on-demand home service platforms, we explore how the platformization of informal beauty work in india has ruptured dominant socio-cultural structures of control that have traditionally shaped women's mobility and access to work. this paper maps the ways in which women beauty gig workers experience and are impacted by algorithmic and bureaucratic management practices prevalent in the gig economy, in the context of home service platforms in bangalore. we find that platform control impacts lives in myriad ways, beyond the conditions of work. women workers negotiate their identities and sense of agency through the visibility afforded by platform control mechanisms. yet, despite these subversions, being on a platform does not fundamentally change the socio-cultural logic that restricts women's lives in india. these mechanisms work to entrench power asymmetries between customers and workers, as well as maintain them between the platform and the worker.",[61] establish a vocabulary of interaction techniques for 3d solid modeling using a spatially-aware tablet in vr; zhu and grossman explore the design space of bidirectional interaction between a spatially-aware smartphone and an ar hmd; and büschel et al.,"complex virtual reality (vr) tasks, like 3d solid modelling, are challenging with standard input controllers. we propose exploiting the affordances and input capabilities when using a 3d-tracked multi-touch tablet in an immersive vr environment. observations gained during semi-structured interviews with general users, and those experienced with 3d software, are used to define a set of design dimensions and guidelines. these are used to develop a vocabulary of interaction techniques to demonstrate how a tablet's precise touch input capability, physical shape, metaphorical associations, and natural compatibility with barehand mid-air input can be used in vr. for example, transforming objects with touch input, ""cutting"" objects by using the tablet as a physical ""knife"", navigating in 3d by using the tablet as a viewport, and triggering commands by interleaving bare-hand input around the tablet. key aspects of the vocabulary are evaluated with users, with results validating the approach.",1057.0,677.0,28550.0
"application-centric computing dominates human-computer interactions, yet the concept of an application is ambiguous and the impact of its ubiquity underexplored. we unpack ""the application"" through the lens of non-standard knowledge work: freelance, self-employed, and fixed-term contract workers who create knowledge in collaboration with a wide variety of stakeholders on a per-project basis. based on interviews with fourteen participants we describe how: i) their economic value is intertwined with data and skills related to specific applications; ii) their access to this value is systematically jeopardised in collaboration due to the different application practices, preferences, and proficiencies of other stakeholders; and iii) they mitigate the costs of this compromise through cross-application collaboration strategies. we trace these experiences to common characteristics of applications, such as update processes, interface symmetries, application-document relationships, and operating system and hardware dependencies. by empirically and analytically focusing on ""the application"", we reveal the implications of the current application-centric computing paradigm and discuss how variations within this model create qualitatively different human-computer interactions.","‘autoplay toggle’ lets a user decide to stop the next video from playing automatically; this may preserve the natural stopping point that comes at the end of the video, a mechanism that has been shown to help users set more deliberate boundaries around use.","in this study, we present coco's videos, a video-viewing platform for preschoolers designed to support them in learning to self-manage their media consumption. we report results from a three-week experimental deployment in 24 homes in which preschoolers used three different versions of the platform: one that is neutral to the limits they set, one that enforces the limits they set, and one that attempts to erode the limits they set by automatically playing additional content after the planned content is finished (""post-play""). we found that post-play significantly reduced children's autonomy and likelihood of self-regulation, extended video-viewing time, and led to increases in parent intervention. we found that the lock-out mechanism did not reduce video-viewing time or the likelihood of parent intervention. together, our results suggest that avoiding platforms that work to undermine the user's intentions is more likely to help children self-regulate their media use than rigid parental controls.",397.0,252.0,22354.0

"older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. to date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. to do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security.","our work builds upon and extends related taxonomies that classify visual design elements, all with different and specific motivations, exploring either the impact of illustrations on learners’ behaviour, new product development, gesture representations or trace figures.","many recent studies have explored user-defined interactions for touch and gesture-based systems through end-user elicitation. while these studies have facilitated the user-end of the human-computer dialogue, the subsequent design of gesture representations to communicate gestures to the user vary in style and consistency. our study explores how users interpret, enact, and refine gesture representations adapting techniques from recent elicitation studies. to inform our study design, we analyzed gesture representations from 30 elicitation papers and developed a taxonomy of design elements. we then conducted a partnered elicitation study with 30 participants producing 657 gesture representations accompanied by think-aloud data. we discuss design patterns and themes that emerged from our analysis, and supplement these findings with an in-depth look at users' mental models when perceiving and enacting gesture representations. finally, based on the results, we provide recommendations for practitioners in need of ""visual language"" guidelines to communicate possible user actions.",1062.0,544.0,11004.0

"circadian rhythms determine daily sleep cycles, mood, and cognition. depending on an individual's circadian preference, or chronotype (i.e.,""early birds"" and ""night owls""), the rhythms shift earlier or later in the day. early birds experience circadian arousal peaks earlier in the morning than night owls. prior work has shown that individuals are more effective at analytic tasks during their peak arousal times but are more creative during their off-peak times. we investigate if these findings hold true for small groups. we find that time of day and a group's majority chronotype impact performance on analytic and creative tasks. physiological synchrony among group members positively predicts group satisfaction. specifically, homogeneous groups perform worse on all tasks regardless of time of day, but they achieve greater physiological synchrony and feel more satisfied as a group. based on these findings, we present and advocate for a temporal dimension of group diversity.","a new thread of work has been started, where religious value-backed technologies are being promoted for attaining environmental sustainability.","while persuasion has often been considered an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. this criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. we join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. based on our six-month long ethnography with the islamic communities in a bangladeshi city, kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. we further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of cscw literature in the various domains.",880.0,993.0,5219.0

"online experimentation with volunteers relies on participants' non-financial motivations to complete a study, such as to altruistically support science or to compare oneself to others. researchers rely on these motivations to attract study participants and often use incentives, like performance comparisons, to encourage participation. often, these study incentives are advertised using a slogan (e.g., ""what is your thinking style?''). research on framing effects suggests that advertisement slogans attract people with varying demographics and motivations. could the slogan advertisements for studies risk attracting only specific users? to investigate the existence of potential sample biases, we measured how different slogan frames affected which participants self-selected into studies. we found that slogan frames impact recruitment significantly; changing the slogan frame from a 'supporting science' frame to a 'comparing oneself to others' frame lead to a 9% increase in recruitment for some studies. additionally, slogans framed as learning more about oneself attract participants significantly more motivated by boredom compared to other slogan frames. we discuss design implications for using frames to improve recruitment and mitigate sources of sample bias in online research with volunteers.","as with other mobile device form factors, performance in tasks involving both viewing content and performing input on wearables drops while walking.","smart glasses are increasingly being used in professional contexts. having key applications such as short messaging and newsreader, they enable continuous access to textual information. in particular, smart glasses allow reading while performing other activities as they do not occlude the user's world view. for efficient reading, it is necessary to understand how a text should be presented on them. we, therefore, conducted a study with 24 participants using a microsoft hololens to investigate how to display text on smart glasses while walking and sitting. we compared text presentation in the top-right, center, and bottom-center positions with rapid serial visual presentation (rsvp) and line-by-line scrolling. we found that text displayed in the top-right of smart glasses increases subjective workload and reduces comprehension. rsvp yields higher comprehension while sitting. conversely, reading with scrolling yields higher comprehension while walking. insights from our study inform the design of reading interfaces for smart glasses.",790.0,44.0,16941.0

"although cost-effective at-home blood pressure monitors are available, a complementary mobile solution can ease the burden of measuring bp at critical points throughout the day. in this work, we developed and evaluated a smartphone-based bp monitoring application called textitseismo. the technique relies on measuring the time between the opening of the aortic valve and the pulse later reaching a periphery arterial site. it uses the smartphone's accelerometer to measure the vibration caused by the heart valve movements and the smartphone's camera to measure the pulse at the fingertip. the system was evaluated in a nine participant longitudinal bp perturbation study. each participant participated in four sessions that involved stationary biking at multiple intensities. the pearson correlation coefficient of the blood pressure estimation across participants is 0.20-0.77 ($mu$=0.55, $sigma$=0.19), with an rmse of 3.3-9.2 mmhg ($mu$=5.2, $sigma$=2.0).","traditional image processing methods: edge/contour detection methods detect and merge edges into ui elements, which can work well on simple guis, but can fall short on images (e.g., gradient background, photos) or complex gui layouts.","interface designers often use screenshot images of example designs as building blocks for new designs. since images are unstructured and hard to edit, designers typically reconstruct screenshots with vector graphics tools in order to reuse or edit parts of the design. unfortunately, this reconstruction process is tedious and slow. we present rewire, an interactive system that helps designers leverage example screenshots. rewire automatically infers a vector representation of screenshots where each ui component is a separate object with editable shape and style properties. based on this representation, the system provides three design assistance modes that help designers reuse or redraw components of the example design. the results from our quantitative and user evaluations demonstrate that rewire can generate accurate vector representations of interface screenshots found in the wild and that design assistance enables users to reconstruct and edit example designs more efficiently compared to a baseline design tool.",422.0,501.0,16554.0
"videos are essential for successful crowdfunding campaigns. however, without knowledge of the underlying persuasion factors, novice entrepreneurs may find it difficult to optimize their videos for success. this paper presents vidlyz, a novel assistive tool that allows users to explore the implications of audience-engagement persuasion factors in the context of campaign videos through contrasting examples, crowd-sourced subjective ratings, and feedback on engagement factors. vidlyz promotes active thinking about the impact of audience persuasion factors in making an effective campaign video by guiding novice entrepreneurs in planning materials of their videos on their own, with consideration of the product category, the target audience, and audience-product interactions. to evaluate our system, we collected subjective ratings and feedback on persuasion factors for 140 kickstarter campaign videos from 2100 crowd workers and presented them through our prototype vidlyz tool. a user study with 45 novice users and five previous campaign creators found that our tool was useful for understanding the implication and relative importance of the persuasion factors of the campaign videos. the interactive and active thinking elements of vidlyz promoted novice users to make coherent and persuasive pre-production plan (using storyboards) for their proposed campaign videos. a follow-up user study showed that these storyboards had a higher likelihood of getting funded by crowd workers than those with less persuasive pre-production plan. we concluded with design implications to better support novice entrepreneurs.","some of the proposed technologies aim to strengthen the relationship by not letting parents interfere and allowing direct communication, since limiting parental scaffolding has shown to result in a strengthened relationship between grandchildren and their grandparents.","distance separated grandparents and grandchildren often face challenges in staying connected. to explore this topic, we designed g2g, a shared calendar and video messaging system to connect young children (ages 5-10) with their grandparents over distance. our design focused on providing grandparents and grandchildren with an awareness of each other's lives to support conversations and design elements to help reduce the need for parent scaffolding. a field study with two grandparent-grandchild pairs over two months showed that systems designed around structured communication can help young children develop a routine around staying in touch with their remote grandparents. autonomy in maintaining awareness can help children to be engaged more easily. this suggests that designs focusing on connecting young children to their grandparents over distance should be flexible yet structured and designing to reduce parental scaffolding can lead to positive effects and strengthened relationships.",863.0,154.0,29067.0

"the livestreaming industry in china is gaining greater traction than its european and north american counterparts and has a profound impact on the stakeholders' online and offline lives. an emerging genre of livestreaming that has become increasingly popular in china is outdoor livestreaming. with outdoor livestreams, streamers broadcast outdoor activities, travel, or socialize with passersby in outdoor settings, often for 6 or more hours, and viewers watch such streams for hours each day. however, given that professionally produced content about travel and outdoor activities are not very popular, it is currently unknown what makes this category of livestreams so engaging and how these techniques can be applied to other content or genres. thus, we conducted a mixed methods study consisting of a survey (n=287) and interviews (n = 20) to understand how viewers watch and engage with outdoor livestreams in china. the data revealed that outdoor livestreams encompass many categories of content, environments and passersby behaviors create challenges and uncertainty for viewers and streamers, and viewers watch livestreams for surprising lengths of time (e.g., sometimes more than 5 continuous hours). we also gained insights into how live commenting and virtual gifting encourage engagement. lastly, we detail how the behaviors of dedicated fans and casual viewers differ and provide implications for the design of livestreaming services that support outdoor activities.","echoing recent concerns regarding the lack of transparency in statistical reporting in hci, we note the lack of clarity and detail required for replicating studies involving the use of eda data.","experimental preregistration is required for publication in many scientific disciplines and venues. when experimental intentions are preregistered, reviewers and readers can be confident that experimental evidence in support of reported hypotheses is not the result of harking, which stands for hypothesising after the results are known. we review the motivation and outcomes of experimental preregistration across a variety of disciplines, as well as previous work commenting on the role of evaluation in hci research. we then discuss how experimental preregistration could be adapted to the distinctive characteristics of human-computer interaction empirical research, to the betterment of the discipline.",845.0,140.0,10432.0

"advances in mobile and wireless technologies provide new possibilities for supporting k-12 learning activities that can be spatially distributed in the classroom, for example in jointly investigating a scientific phenomenon. such technologies have an impact on the ways in which students engage with one another, and with the quality of their engagement with the activity itself. this paper uses an embodied approach to understand the patterns of interactions between students (e.g., student-to-student, student-to-teacher) and with computational media within the environment (e.g., student-to-device, student-to-large display), in relation to students' real-time meaning making as they engage in collective inquiry in an immersive simulation environment. the design-based research study consists of two iterations tested in an authentic school setting. we found that increased student-to-student interactions was accompanied by improved observational accuracy and higher quality student explanations constructed. the design implications of the research findings are discussed.","as a result, there have been growing concerns about children's interpersonal, institutional, and commercial privacy in the digital environment, such as online stranger danger, misuse or mishandling of sensitive family data by institutions, and monetizing children's data for profiling or behavioral targeting.","across social care, healthcare and public policy, enabled by the ""big data"" revolution (which has normalized large-scale data-based decision-making), there are moves to ""join up"" citizen databases to provide care workers with holistic views of families they support. in this context, questions of personal data privacy, security, access, control and (dis-)empowerment are critical considerations for system designers and policy makers alike. to explore the family perspective on this landscape of what we call family civic data, we carried out ethnographic interviews with four north-east families. our design-game-based interviews were effective for engaging both adults and children to talk about the impact of this dry, technical topic on their lives. our findings, delivered in the form of design guidelines, show support for dynamic consent: families would feel most empowered if involved in an ongoing co-operative relationship with state welfare and civic authorities through shared interaction with their data.",450.0,135.0,41776.0

"augmentative and alternative communication (aac) technologies are widely used to help non-verbal children enable communication. for aac-aided communication to be successful, caregivers should support children with consistent intervention strategies in various settings. as such, caregivers need to continuously observe and discuss children's aac usage to create a shared understanding of these strategies. however, caregivers often find it challenging to effectively collaborate with one another due to a lack of family involvement and the unstructured process of collaboration. to address these issues, we present talkingboogie, which consists of two mobile apps: talkingboogie-aac for caregiver-child communication, and talkingboogie-coach supporting caregiver collaboration. working together, these applications provide contextualized layouts for symbol arrangement, scaffold the process of sharing and discussing observations, and induce caregivers' balanced participation. a two-week deployment study with four groups (n=11) found that talkingboogie helped increase mutual understanding of strategies and encourage balanced participation between caregivers with reduced cognitive loads.","a-line, thermorph, and 4dmesh explored various 3d geometries which were transformed from 1d lines, 2d sheets, and 2d meshes.","we develop a novel method printing complex self-folding geometries. we demonstrated that with a desktop fused deposition modeling (fdm) 3d printer, off-the-shelf printing filaments and a design editor, we can print flat thermoplastic composites and trigger them to self-fold into 3d with arbitrary bending angles. this is a suitable technique, called thermorph, to prototype hollow and foldable 3d shapes without losing key features. we describe a new curved folding origami design algorithm, compiling given arbitrary 3d models to 2d unfolded models in g-code for fdm printers. to demonstrate the thermorph platform, we designed and printed complex self-folding geometries (up to 70 faces), including 15 self-curved geometric primitives and 4 self-curved applications, such as chairs, the simplified stanford bunny and flowers. compared to the standard 3d printing, our method saves up to 60% - 87% of the printing time for all shapes chosen.",751.0,258.0,26204.0
"most us social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. for lgbtq+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. these choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. moreover, many lgbtq+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their lgbtq+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. this combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of lgbtq+ and other potentially stigmatized users. we adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 lgbtq+ social media users. we find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ""personal social media ecosystems"" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their lgbtq+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.","while they have mainly been in chat, to maximize the benefits of viewer interactions, researchers and practitioners have been designing tools that allow viewers to communicate with richer modalities, including images, videos, audios, and controls in games.","despite gaining traction in north america, live streaming has not reached the popularity it has in china, where live- streaming has a tremendous impact on the social behaviors of users. to better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in china. we present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. we also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. we also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.",811.0,463.0,6153.0
"low-cost fabrication machines (e.g., 3d printers) offer the promise of creating custom-designed objects by a range of users. to maximize performance, generative design methods such as topology optimization can automatically optimize properties of a design based on high-level specifications. though promising, such methods require people to map their design ideas--often unintuitively--to a small number of mathematical input parameters, and the relationship between those parameters and a generated design is often unclear, making it difficult to iterate a design. we present forte, a sketch-based, real-time interactive tool for people to directly express and iterate on their designs via 2d topology optimization. users can ask the system to add structures, provide a variation with better performance, or optimize internal material layouts. users can globally control how much to 'deviate' from the initial sketch, or perform local suggestive editing, which interactively prompts the system to update based on the new information. design sessions with 10 participants demonstrate that forte empowers designers to create and explore a range of optimized designs with custom forms and styles.",[24] explore how desire shapes energy consumption and how desires embedded into smart home technologies both complement and conflict with each other.,"research has shown that desirable designs shape the use and experiences people have when interacting with technology. nevertheless, how desirability influences energy consumption is often overlooked, particularly in hci studies evaluating the sustainability benefits of smart home technology. in this paper, we present a qualitative study with 23 australian households who reflect on their experiences of living with smart home devices. drawing on nelson and stolterman's concept of desiderata we develop a typology of householders' desires for the smart home and their energy implications. we structure these desires as three smart home personas: the helper, optimiser and hedonist, which align with desiderata's three approaches to desire (reason, ethics and aesthetics). we use these insights to discuss how desirability can be used within hci for steering design of the smart home towards sustainability.",493.0,3.0,24936.0

"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.","by reporting on the critical motivations to use and cite probes, as well as the reflective practice of making them as in the example of, the latent critique in the original probes and its increasingly divergent interpretations may be turned into a productive discussion about the normative conceptions of method, research, and ‘user’ within hci.","taskcams are simple digital cameras intended to serve as a tool for cultural probe studies and made available by the interaction research studio via open-source distribution. in conjunction with an associated website, instructions and videos, they represent a novel strategy for disseminating and facilitating a research methodology. at the same time, they provide a myriad of options for customisation and modification, allowing researchers to adopt and adapt them to their needs. in the first part of this paper, the design team describes the rationale and design of the taskcams and the tactics developed to make them publicly available. in the second part, the story is taken up by designers from the everyday design studio, who assembled their own taskcams and customised them extensively for a cultural probe study they ran for an ongoing project. rather than discussing the results of their study, we focus on how their experiences reveal some of the issues both in producing and using open-source products such as these. these suggest the potential of taskcams to support design-led user studies more generally.",997.0,70.0,38403.0

"through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.","second, another user study found that using multiple pictures of the same person in different situations came with the side-effect of confusion, as the end users tend to expect one and not many persona pictures.","in this research, we investigate if and how more photos than a single headshot can heighten the level of information provided by persona profiles. we conduct eye-tracking experiments and qualitative interviews with variations in the photos: a single headshot, a headshot and images of the persona in different contexts, and a headshot with pictures of different people representing key persona attributes. the results show that more contextual photos significantly improve the information end users derive from a persona profile; however, showing images of different people creates confusion and lowers the informativeness. moreover, we discover that choice of pictures results in various interpretations of the persona that are biased by the end users' experiences and preconceptions. the results imply that persona creators should consider the design power of photos when creating persona profiles.",709.0,315.0,26047.0

"in recent years, the entity--component--system pattern has become a fundamental feature of the software architectures of game-development environments such as unity and unreal, which are used extensively in developing 3d user interfaces. in these systems, ui components typically respond to events, requiring programmers to write application-specific callback functions. in some cases, components are organized in a hierarchy that is used to propagate events among vertically connected components. when components need to communicate horizontally, programmers must connect those components manually and register/unregister events as needed. moreover, events and callback signatures may be incompatible, making modular uis cumbersome to build and share within or across applications. to address these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, mercury, to facilitate communication among components. we provide an overview of mercury, outline its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using relay nodes, describe a reference implementation in unity, and present example systems built using mercury to explain its advantages.","more recently, the olo radio project has shown the value in interconnecting memory-oriented data with different temporal modalities as novel resources for supporting both serendipitous and planned experiences of reminiscence.","with the massive adoption of music streaming services globally, metadata is being generated that captures people's music listening histories in more precise detail than ever before. these metadata archives offer a valuable and overlooked resource for designing new ways of supporting people in experiencing the music they have listened to over the course of their lives. yet, little research has demonstrated how metadata can be applied as a material in design practice. we describe the design of olo radio, a device that leverages music listening history metadata to support experiences of exploring and living with music from one's past. we unpack and reflect on design choices that made use of the exacting precision captured in listening history metadata archives to support relatively imprecise qualities of feedback and interaction to encourage rich, open-ended experiences of contemplation, curiosity, and enjoyment over time. we conclude with implications for hci research and practice in this space.",585.0,103.0,9803.0

"while much popular discussion of representation in games exists, there is very little rigorously collected data available from which to draw direct conclusions. in this study, we set out to address this gap by performing a census of playable characters across a large sample of contemporary games. we gathered data from 200 games including independently published (""indie"") games and so-called ""aaa"" titles from large publishers. while our initial analysis yielded some insight into the landscape of playable characters, it also highlighted the contingent, negotiated, and interpretive nature of representation in games. this led to additional analysis that emphasized the ways in which this negotiation manifests in research in the methods and metrics used to quantify representation. we argue that researchers studying representation in games need to treat it as a possibility space for a multitude of potential interpretations rather than a singular, measurable, phenomenon.","however, researchers have observed a large number of disclosures of negative and stigmatized experiences and/or emotions on social media, such as depression, eating disorders, pregnancy loss, sexual abuse, and lgbtq identity.","in cscw and hci, work examining expression of mental health and illness on social media frequently aims to classify content, quantify visual trends, and predict user states. this approach to analysis is a form of the coded gaze, a type of algorithmic 'way of seeing' coined with respect to artificial intelligence techniques. the coded gaze classifies content through researcher- and machine-labeled categories, relying on a series of theoretical assumptions that influence how values pertaining to mental health and illness become inscribed in data. in this paper, we build upon this research to support alternative methods of data interpretation. we join manual collection of instagram posts with semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography over six months to understand how instagram users express their experiences with mental health and illness. we argue that individuals negotiate claims to mental health and illness through visibility and signaling, the boundaries between mental health and illness are porous and blurred, and reposting and remix are a form of participation. we discuss practical and ethical implications for studying the expression of mental health and illness online.",92.0,818.0,39514.0

"advances in mobile and wireless technologies provide new possibilities for supporting k-12 learning activities that can be spatially distributed in the classroom, for example in jointly investigating a scientific phenomenon. such technologies have an impact on the ways in which students engage with one another, and with the quality of their engagement with the activity itself. this paper uses an embodied approach to understand the patterns of interactions between students (e.g., student-to-student, student-to-teacher) and with computational media within the environment (e.g., student-to-device, student-to-large display), in relation to students' real-time meaning making as they engage in collective inquiry in an immersive simulation environment. the design-based research study consists of two iterations tested in an authentic school setting. we found that increased student-to-student interactions was accompanied by improved observational accuracy and higher quality student explanations constructed. the design implications of the research findings are discussed.","as a common evaluation technique, we saw more value in conducting walkthrough demonstrations as opposed to usability studies, since we aimed to learn how instructors might use, and in fact wish to adapt, our tools for teaching courses in their own domains, while still gaining feedback on the utility of xrstudio's current features.","toolkit research plays an important role in the field of hci, as it can heavily influence both the design and implementation of interactive systems. for publication, the hci community typically expects toolkit research to include an evaluation component. the problem is that toolkit evaluation is challenging, as it is often unclear what 'evaluating' a toolkit means and what methods are appropriate. to address this problem, we analyzed 68 published toolkit papers. from our analysis, we provide an overview of, reflection on, and discussion of evaluation methods for toolkit contributions. we identify and discuss the value of four toolkit evaluation strategies, including the associated techniques that each employs. we offer a categorization of evaluation strategies for toolkit researchers, along with a discussion of the value, potential limitations, and trade-offs associated with each strategy.",450.0,35.0,6107.0
"independence is a central concern for people in the care of many chronic conditions. it is often viewed as a goal that can be facilitated with the use of patient data. it is also viewed, especially from the medical side, as something an individual achieves. however, in the lived experience, independence is often a set of collaborative practices. in this paper, we unpack findings from an interview-based study of spinal cord injury (sci) self-care. we found that independence - both functional and in the form of effecting agency - must be co-constructed by the choices and activities of the care network, including the person with disability, caregivers, and clinicians. this collaboratively shaped independence also affects potential collection and use of data in support of self-care. we describe how collaboratively shaped independence informs requirements and constraints for the design of sensor-based networks for self-care in long-term chronic disability.","the costume consisted of plastic wires aligned around the dancer's waist to emulate a dress, which also had leds that emulated wave effects to accompany the performance.","in the 1920s, oskar schlemmer, artist in the bauhaus movement, created the triadic ballet costumes. these re-strict movement of dancers, creating new expressions. in-spired by this, we designed an interactive wire costume. it restricts lower body movements, and emphasizes arm movements spurring led-light 'sparks' and 'waves' wired in a tutu-like costume. the wire costume was introduced to a dancer who found that an unusual bond emerged be-tween her and the costume. we discuss how sensory altera-tion (sight, kinesthetic awareness and proprioception) and bodily training to adjust to the new soma, can result in nov-el, evocative forms of expression. the interactive costume can foster a certain mood, introduce feelings, and even embody a whole character -- only revealed once worn and danced. we describe a design exploration combining cul-tural and historical research, interviews with experts and material explorations that culminated in a novel prototype.",794.0,60.0,15620.0

"machine learning (ml) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. one application of ml is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. however, no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. in this paper, we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm, and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly, communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. in two evaluations with pathologists, we found that these tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. the tools were preferred over a traditional interface, without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. we also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools, re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ml errors from their own errors. taken together, these findings inform future human-ml collaborative systems for expert decision-making.","in fact, since computational notebooks are adopted by a wide variety of users, their technical expertise will vary.","today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. however, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. in this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. we focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., jupyter notebook). we found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). we also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions.",668.0,906.0,44499.0

"the rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. this paper contributes to such research in two ways. first, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. second, through a controlled experimental study on amazon mechanical turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. we studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. these results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.","moving towards devices, instead of material properties, made from metamaterials, the integration of mechanisms, computation and shape-change into metamaterial structures have been shown.","we present metamaterial textures---3d printed surface geometries that can perform a controlled transition between two or more textures. metamaterial textures are integrated into 3d printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. inspired by foldable paper sheets (""origami"") and surface wrinkling, our 3d printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold when compressed by an external global force. unlike origami, however, metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. this allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. metamaterial textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed, or stood on. this allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. we present an editor assists users in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces, and previewing their deformation.",870.0,334.0,41100.0

"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.","instead, our work is based on the call-to-action to the computer science community to actively involve the general public in the decision making process of new ai systems.","the increased reliance on algorithmic decision-making in socially impactful processes has intensified the calls for algorithms that are unbiased and procedurally fair. identifying fair predictors is an essential step in the construction of equitable algorithms, but the lack of ground-truth in fair predictor selection makes this a challenging task. in our study, we recruit 90 crowdworkers to judge the inclusion of various predictors for recidivism. we divide participants across three conditions with varying group composition. our results show that participants were able to make informed decisions on predictor selection. we find that agreement with the majority vote is higher when participants are part of a more diverse group. the presented workflow, which provides a scalable and practical approach to reach a diverse audience, allows researchers to capture participants' perceptions of fairness in private while simultaneously allowing for structured participant discussion.",997.0,848.0,14605.0

"most us social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. for lgbtq+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. these choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. moreover, many lgbtq+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their lgbtq+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. this combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of lgbtq+ and other potentially stigmatized users. we adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 lgbtq+ social media users. we find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ""personal social media ecosystems"" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their lgbtq+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.","similar to how dearboard repurposes a keyboard as a host to app-agnostic functionality, other research has experimented with notifications and chat heads as global access points to functionality that complement existing apps.","while mobile instant messaging (mim) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. we examine two design concepts for mim-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. we built mybutler, an android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with kakaotalk, a commercial mim app. during a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. we reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in mim communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of mim users in choosing whether to alert their messages. in terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. we found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations.",811.0,918.0,20853.0

"online donation platforms help equalize access to opportunity and funding in cases where inequalities exist. in the context of public school education in the united states, for instance, financial inequalities have been shown to be reflected in the educational system, since schools are primarily funded through local property taxes. in response, private charitable donation platforms such as donorschoose.org have emerged seeking to alleviate systemic inequalities. yet, the question remains of how effective these platforms are in redressing existing funding inequalities across school districts. our analysis of donation data from donorschoose shows that such platforms may in fact be ineffective in mitigating existing inequalities or may even exacerbate them. in this paper, we explore how online educational charities could direct more funding towards more impoverished schools without compromising their donors' freedom of choice with respect to donation targets. seeking to answer this question, we draw on the line of work on choice architectures in behavioral economics and pose a novel research question on the impact of interface design on equity in socio-technical systems. through controlled experiments, we demonstrate how simple interface design interventions - such as modifying default rankings or displaying additional information about schools - might lead to changes in donation distributions helping platforms direct more funding towards schools in need. going beyond online educational charities, we hope that our work will bring attention to the role of interface design nudges in the social requirements of online altruism.","today's interactive devices increasingly instrument every kind of surface, effectively adding interactive functionality even to passive everyday objects such as walls, tables, and rapidly prototyped objects, as well as to the user's body.","human environments are typified by walls, homes, offices, schools, museums, hospitals and pretty much every indoor context one can imagine has walls. in many cases, they make up a majority of readily accessible indoor surface area, and yet they are static their primary function is to be a wall, separating spaces and hiding infrastructure. we present wall++, a low-cost sensing approach that allows walls to become a smart infrastructure. instead of merely separating spaces, walls can now enhance rooms with sensing and interactivity. our wall treatment and sensing hardware can track users' touch and gestures, as well as estimate body pose if they are close. by capturing airborne electromagnetic noise, we can also detect what appliances are active and where they are located. through a series of evaluations, we demonstrate wall++ can enable robust room-scale interactive and context-aware applications.",991.0,271.0,12503.0

"real-time collaborative editing (rtce) is a popular way of instrumenting cooperative work on documents, in particular on the web. little is known in the literature yet about rtce usage patterns in the real world. in this paper we study how a popular rtce editor (etherpad) is used in the wild, digging into the edit histories of a large collection of documents (about 14 000 pads), retrieved from one of the most popular public instances of the platform, hosted by the wikimedia foundation. the pad analysis is supported by a novel conceptual model that allows to label edit operations as ""collaborative"" or not depending on their distance-in edit position (space), edit time, or spacetime (both)-from edits made by other authors. the model is applied to classify all edits from the pad corpus. classification results are further used to characterize the collaboration behavior of pad authors. findings show that: 1) about half of the pads have a single author and hence witnessed no collaboration; 2) collaboration on common document parts happens often, but it happens asynchronously with authors taking turns in editing; and 3) simultaneous editing of common document parts happens very rarely. these findings help in revisiting early rtce design decisions (e.g., the granularity of conflict management in rtce protocols) and give insights on how to address novel needs (e.g., end-to-end encryption and offline editing).","in this light, manuel and crivellaro emphasize the need for a new approach enabling “citizens to use existing open-source tools developed in hci to create a more sustainable long-term impact” (p. 10).","there has been a growing interest in hci in designing and developing technology to support democratic participation, particularly in the domain of urban planning or place-based research. in addition, the hci field has increasingly considered the intersection of hci and policymaking to understand how our research can have a broader impact. in this paper, we report on a series of workshops with citizens and city planners to explore place-based policymaking through the case study of neighbourhood planning in the uk. our analysis highlights the tensions, opportunities and challenges faced by citizens in creating policy. drawing from our findings, we stress the need for hci to be actively involved in supporting, innovating and (re)designing civic policymaking processes while emphasising design considerations for the development of technological tools.",808.0,755.0,4893.0
"this paper reports on the changes in the monetary ecology around loan payments by auto rickshaw drivers shortly after the introduction of a mobile app in karnataka, india. a for-profit, social enterprise facilitates loans for purchasing auto rickshaws. the mobile app was designed and implemented to provide accurate, timely loan information for drivers, to support the collaborative work of loan collection payment, and streamline the workflows of the organization. in this paper, we report on the initial experiences with the app, and argue that its introduction led to a tighter coupling of the actors involved and moved control to the back office, which especially impacted the pre- and at-transaction interactions of the monetary ecology. the paper reflects on how these changes impact adoption and use of the app and suggests a number of changes to the design which might address the observed problematics.","many researchers have explored this rich interaction space by designing and recognizing hand gestures on and around different body parts, such as palm, arms, leg, face, nose, ear, and even the hair.","interacting with a smartphone using touch input and speech output is challenging for visually impaired people in mobile and public scenarios, where only one hand may be available for input (e.g., while holding a cane) and using the loudspeaker for speech output is constrained by environmental noise, privacy, and social concerns. to address these issues, we propose eartouch, a one-handed interaction technique that allows the users to interact with a smartphone using the ear to perform gestures on the touchscreen. users hold the phone to their ears and listen to speech output from the ear speaker privately. we report how the technique was designed, implemented, and evaluated through a series of studies. results show that eartouch is easy, efficient, fun and socially acceptable to use.",839.0,688.0,397.0

"despite their pervasiveness, current text-based conversational agents (chatbots) are predominantly monolingual, while users are often multilingual. it is well-known that multilingual users mix languages while interacting with others, as well as in their interactions with computer systems (such as query formulation in text-/voice-based search interfaces and digital assistants). linguists refer to this phenomenon as code-mixing or code-switching. do multilingual users also prefer chatbots that can respond in a code-mixed language over those which cannot? in order to inform the design of chatbots for multilingual users, we conduct a mixed-method user-study (n=91) where we examine how conversational agents, that code-mix and reciprocate the users' mixing choices over multiple conversation turns, are evaluated and perceived by bilingual users. we design a human-in-the-loop chatbot with two different code-mixing policies -- (a) always code-mix irrespective of user behavior, and (b) nudge with subtle code-mixed cues and reciprocate only if the user, in turn, code-mixes. these two are contrasted with a monolingual chatbot that never code-mixed. users are asked to interact with the bots, and provide ratings on perceived naturalness and personal preference. they are also asked open-ended questions around what they (dis)liked about the bots. analysis of the chat logs, users' ratings, and qualitative responses reveal that multilingual users strongly prefer chatbots that can code-mix. we find that self-reported language proficiency is the strongest predictor of user preferences. compared to the always code-mix policy, nudging emerges as a low-risk low-gain policy which is equally acceptable to all users. nudging as a policy is further supported by the observation that users who rate the code-mixing bot higher typically tend to reciprocate the language mixing pattern of the bot. these findings present a first step towards developing conversational systems that are more human-like and engaging by virtue of adapting to the users' linguistic style.",human–computer interaction (hci) researchers have also extensively used nfc or rfid tags for prototyping tangible user interfaces (tuis) because of their low price and ready availability.,"we present project zanzibar: a flexible mat that can locate, uniquely identify and communicate with tangible objects placed on its surface, as well as sense a user's touch and hover hand gestures. we describe the underlying technical contributions: efficient and localised near field communication (nfc) over a large surface area; object tracking combining nfc signal strength and capacitive footprint detection, and manufacturing techniques for a rollable device form-factor that enables portability, while providing a sizable interaction area when unrolled. in addition, we detail design patterns for tangibles of varying complexity and interactive capabilities, including the ability to sense orientation on the mat, harvest power, provide additional input and output, stack, or extend sensing outside the bounds of the mat. capabilities and interaction modalities are illustrated with self-generated applications. finally, we report on the experience of professional game developers building novel physical/digital experiences using the platform.",925.0,512.0,30446.0

"in this paper, we use a materiality lens to explore how information and communication technologies condition interaction between citizens and policymakers of the u.s. congress. we work with ethnographic data - six months of observation in washington d.c. and 48 interviews with staff in the house of representatives. customer relation management systems (crms) used by congress are one of numerous technologies expected to enhance responsive communication between citizens and representatives. we find, instead, that these technologies promote the datafication of citizen information that configures and constrains how policymakers engage citizens as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. crms not only mediate communication between citizens and policymakers, they shape the idea of what communication between citizens and policymakers can be and how citizens are viewed in the eyes of policymakers and their staff. thus, we extend our understanding of the ways in which material configurations of communication technologies influence not only how communication acts unfolds, but also how each partner conceives of and engages with the other. this has dramatic implications for the possibilities of digital communication channels to enhance, or uphold, the ideals of a representative democracy.","commensurate with findings from hong we also show that trust amongst individuals engaged in data work was as important, or more so, than trust in automl.","as the use of machine learning (ml) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. while scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like hci, ml, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. this lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. to bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ml models. the characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. we present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.",867.0,952.0,37031.0

"the wide adoption of machine learning (ml) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ml models. some advocated the term ""machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ml models. this ""teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-ai interfaces. one promising learning paradigm is active learning (al), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. however, in current al settings, the human-ai interface remains minimal and opaque. a dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for al algorithms. in this work, we begin considering ai explanations as a core element of the human-ai interface for teaching machines. when a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. when a ml model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. when the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (xal), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable ai (xai) into an al setting. we conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with xal, to that of traditional al and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). our study shows benefits of ai explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to ai explanations, including task knowledge, ai experience and need for cognition. by reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for xal, and more broadly, machine teaching through ai explanations.","regarding platforms that host diverse voices (e.g., an online forum), a recent study has examined different types of support sought by different roles, such as people with dementia, people experiencing dementia-like symptoms but undiagnosed, family, friends, and caregivers, to analyze interaction dynamics and develop moderation models.","social computing provides a variety of challenges and opportunities for people who are experiencing cognitive decline. following a recent diagnosis of dementia, older adults sometimes engage in online communities designated for people with dementia. in this work, we analyzed all original posts from a seven-year period on a forum for persons with dementia to understand 1) who posts in this forum and 2) what kinds of social support posters seek to gain from this engagement. our analyses indicate that, in addition to people with dementia, a variety of dementia-related stakeholders create original posts in this forum. our results suggest that seeking and offering social support are key activities for all forum users, not just those with dementia for whom the forum was designated. given these findings, we offer design implications for online spaces for vulnerable communities, with a focus on design that allows for external stakeholder participation while still maintaining the privacy and safety of vulnerable members of the community.",1042.0,992.0,22738.0

"online social networks (osn) play an essential role for connecting people and allowing them to communicate online. osn users share their thoughts, moments, and news with their network. the messages they share online can include sarcastic posts, where the intended meaning expressed by the written text is different from the literal one. this could result in miscommunication. previous research in psycholinguistics has studied the sociocultural factors the might lead to sarcasm misunderstanding between speakers and listeners. however, there is a lack of such studies in the context of osn. in this paper we fill this gap by performing a quantitative analysis on the influence of sociocultural variables, including gender, age, country, and english language nativeness, on the effectiveness of sarcastic communication online. we collect examples of sarcastic tweets directly from the authors who posted them. further, we ask third-party annotators of different sociocultural backgrounds to label these tweets for sarcasm. our analysis indicates that age, english language nativeness, and country are significantly influential and should be considered in the design of future social analysis tools that either study sarcasm directly, or look at related phenomena where sarcasm may have an influence. we also make observations about the social ecology surrounding sarcastic exchanges on osns. we conclude by suggesting ways in which our findings can be included in future work.","tablet flip, holding a device at different angles for different actions).","complex virtual reality (vr) tasks, like 3d solid modelling, are challenging with standard input controllers. we propose exploiting the affordances and input capabilities when using a 3d-tracked multi-touch tablet in an immersive vr environment. observations gained during semi-structured interviews with general users, and those experienced with 3d software, are used to define a set of design dimensions and guidelines. these are used to develop a vocabulary of interaction techniques to demonstrate how a tablet's precise touch input capability, physical shape, metaphorical associations, and natural compatibility with barehand mid-air input can be used in vr. for example, transforming objects with touch input, ""cutting"" objects by using the tablet as a physical ""knife"", navigating in 3d by using the tablet as a viewport, and triggering commands by interleaving bare-hand input around the tablet. key aspects of the vocabulary are evaluated with users, with results validating the approach.",913.0,677.0,28586.0
"studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. this skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. for example, kay et al. showed that although 28% of ceos in the u.s. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for ""ceo"" in google image search are women. similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. these labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. however, such labels are often unknown. further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. as observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. we develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. the goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. it accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this ""diversity score"" into the final selection process. importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. we provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known mmr algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. we evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 google image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known celeba dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as ""smiling"" or ""glasses"". both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current google image search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. these empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search.","second, previous work has hinted at the existence of a social contract associated with vr-play.","research on virtual reality (vr) has studied users' experience of immersion, presence, simulator sickness, and learning effects. however, the momentary experience of exiting vr and transitioning back to the real-world is not well understood. do users become self-conscious of their actions upon exit? are users nervous of their surroundings? using explicitation interviews, we explore the moment of exit from vr across four applications. analysis of the interviews reveals five components of experience: space, control, sociality, time, and sensory adaptation. participants described spatial disorientation, for example, regardless of the complexity of the vr scene. participants also described a window across which they exit vr, for example mentally first and then physically. we present six designs for easing or heightening the exit experience, as described by the participants. based on these findings, we further discuss the ?moment of exit' as an opportunity for designing engaging and enhanced vr experiences.",1004.0,480.0,31611.0
"as design thinking shifted away from conventional methods with the rapid adoption of computer-aided design and fabrication technologies, architects have been seeking ways to initiate a comprehensive dialogue between the virtual and the material realms. current methodologies do not offer embodied workflows that utilize the feedback obtained through a subsequent transition process between physical and digital design. therefore, narrowing the separation between these two platforms remains as a research problem. this literature review elaborates the divide between physical and digital design, testing and manufacturing techniques in the morphological process of architectural form. we first review the digital transformation in the architectural design discourse. then, we proceed by introducing a variety of methods that are integrating digital and physical workflows and suggesting an alternative approach. our work unveils that there is a need for empirical research with a focus on integrated approaches to create intuitively embodied experiences for architectural designers.","existing research underlines that psychological needs are regarded as important and that these should be considered when designing products and interactions, as well as when investigating acceptability.","autonomous vehicles have the potential to fundamentally change existing transportation systems. beyond legal concerns, these societal evolutions will critically depend on user acceptance. as an emerging mode of public transportation [7], autonomous mobility on demand (amod) is of particular interest in this context. the aim of the present study is to identify the main components of acceptability (before first use) and acceptance (after first use) of amod, following a user experience (ux) framework. to address this goal, we conducted three workshops (n=14) involving open discussions and a ride in an experimental autonomous shuttle. using a mixed-methods approach, we measured pre-immersion acceptability before immersing the participants in an on-demand transport scenario, and eventually measured post-immersion acceptance of amod. results show that participants were reassured about safety concerns, however they perceived the amod experience as ineffective. our findings highlight key factors to be taken into account when designing amod experiences.",724.0,609.0,9212.0

management of technological change in organizations is one of the most enduring topics in the literature on computer-supported cooperative work. the successful navigation of technological change is both more challenging and more critical in online communities that are entirely mediated by technology than it is in traditional organizations. this paper presents an analysis of 14 in-depth interviews with moderators of subcommunities of one technological platform (reddit) that added communities on a new technological platform (discord). moderation teams experienced several problems related to moderating content at scale as well as a disconnect between the affordances of discord and their assumptions based on their experiences on reddit. we found that moderation teams used discord's api to create scripts and bots that augmented discord to make the platform work more like tools on reddit. these tools were particularly important in communities struggling with scale. our findings suggest that increasingly widespread end user programming allow users of social computing systems to innovate and deploy solutions to unanticipated design problems by transforming new technological platforms to align with their past expectations.,[18] provided an in-situ visualization within the code to summarize variable values and distributions.,"programmers must draw explicit connections between their code and runtime state to properly assess the correctness of their programs. however, debugging tools often decouple the program state from the source code and require explicitly invoked views to bridge the rift between program editing and program understanding. to unobtrusively reveal runtime behavior during both normal execution and debugging, we contribute techniques for visualizing program variables directly within the source code. we describe a design space and placement criteria for embedded visualizations. we evaluate our in situ visualizations in an editor for the vega visualization grammar. compared to a baseline development environment, novice vega users improve their overall task grade by about 2 points when using the in situ visualizations and exhibit significant positive effects on their self-reported speed and accuracy.",864.0,529.0,18513.0

"expressing one's thoughts and feelings is a fundamental human need - the basis for communication and social interaction. we ask, how do minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum express themselves? how can we better recognise instances of self-expression? and how might technologies support and encourage self-expression? to address these questions, we undertook co-design research at an autism-specific primary school with 20 children over one school year. this paper contributes six modalities of self-expression, through which children self-express and convey their design insights. each modality of self-expression can occur across two different dimensions (socio-expressive and auto-expressive) and can be of a fundamental or an integrative nature. further, we contribute the design trajectory of a tangible ball prototype, the expressiball, which - through voice, sounds, lights, and motion sensors - explores how tangible technologies can support this range of expressive modalities. finally, we discuss the concept of self-expression by design.","we referenced to multiple state-of-the-art conversational agent techniques in designing our osc, e.g., group decision supports, psychotherapy, in-depth interview for healthcare and educational.","we are interested in increasing the ability of groups to collaborate efficiently by leveraging new advances in ai and conversational agent (ca) technology. given the longstanding debate on the necessity of embodiment for cas, bringing them to groups requires answering the questions of whether and how providing a ca with a face affects its interaction with the humans in a group. we explored these questions by comparing group decision-making sessions facilitated by an embodied agent, versus a voice-only agent. results of an experiment with 20 user groups revealed that while the embodiment improved various aspects of group's social perception of the agent (e.g., rapport, trust, intelligence, and power), its impact on the group-decision process and outcome was nuanced. drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss the pros and cons of embodiment, argue that the value of having a face depends on the types of assistance the agent provides, and lay out directions for future research.",768.0,389.0,8942.0
"humans can perceive tactile sensation through multimodal stimuli. to demonstrate realistic pseudo tactile sensation for the users, a tactile display is needed that can provide multiple tactile stimuli. in this paper, we have explicated a novel printed tactile display that can provide both the electrical stimulus and the electrostatic force. the circuit patterns for each stimulus were fabricated by employing the technique of double-sided conductive ink printing. requirements for the fabrication process were analyzed and the durability of the tactile display was evaluated. users' perceptions of a single tactile stimulus and multiple tactile stimuli were also investigated. the obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed tactile display is capable of exhibiting realistic tactile sensation and can be incorporated by various applications such as tactile sensation printing of pictorial illustrations and paintings. furthermore, the proposed hybrid tactile display can contribute to accelerated prototyping and development of new tactile devices.","increased acceptance of intrusion could be explained by the ‘foot in the door’ phenomenon, which describes increasing acceptance of previously unacceptable technological intrusion by the introduction of marginally acceptable but useful technologies.","through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.",447.0,709.0,19898.0

"effective task management is essential to successful team collaboration. while the past decade has seen considerable innovation in systems that track and manage group tasks, these innovations have typically been outside of the principal communication channels: email, instant messenger, and group chat. teams formulate, discuss, refine, assign, and track the progress of their collaborative tasks over electronic communication channels, yet they must leave these channels to update their task-tracking tools, creating a source of friction and inefficiency. to address this problem, we explore how bots might be used to mediate task management for individuals and teams. we deploy a prototype bot to eight different teams of information workers to help them create, assign, and keep track of tasks, all within their main communication channel. we derived seven insights for the design of future bots for coordinating work.","inflatable actuators have also been used to generate touch stimuli on arms, wrists, and torso.","immersive experiences seek to engage the full sensory system in ways that words, pictures, or touch alone cannot. with respect to the haptic system, however, physical feedback has been provided primarily with handheld tactile experiences or vibration-based designs, largely ignoring both pressure receptors and the full upper-body area as conduits for expressing meaning that is consistent with sight and sound. we extend the potential for immersion along these dimensions with the force jacket, a novel array of pneumatically-actuated airbags and force sensors that provide precisely directed force and high frequency vibrations to the upper body. we describe the pneumatic hardware and force control algorithms, user studies to verify perception of airbag location and pressure magnitude, and subsequent studies to define full-torso, pressure and vibration-based feel effects such as punch, hug, and snake moving across the body. we also discuss the use of those effects in prototype virtual reality applications.",57.0,318.0,40055.0
"remote collaborations are becoming ubiquitous, but, despite their many advantages, face unique challenges compared to collocated collaborations. visualizing the collaborator's point of gaze on a shared screen has been explored as a promising way to alleviate some of these limitations by increasing shared awareness. however, prior studies on shared gaze have not considered the medium of communication and have only studied its effect on audio. this paper presents a study that compares the effects of shared gaze on collaboration performance during audio- and text-based communication. we find that for text, shared gaze improved task correctness and led collaborators to look at and talk more about shared content. similar trends are found for gaze-augmented voice communication, but contrary to the slower performance in text, it also saw improvements in completion time as well as in cognitive workload. our findings demonstrate the differences in how shared gaze impacts audio- versus text-based communication and highlight the need to further understand the nuances of the medium of communication when designing novel tools to support remote collaborators.","for example, researchers have developed handheld devices giving users a sense of force, weight, or haptics (e.g.,), and have enhanced experience in the real world with mixed reality approaches such as tele-conferencing, eating, drawing, etc.","claw is a handheld virtual reality controller that augments the typical controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. our controller enables three distinct interactions (grasping virtual object, touching virtual surfaces, and triggering) and changes its corresponding haptic rendering by sensing the differences in the user's grasp. a servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement. claw also supports a haptic force feedback in the trigger mode when the user holds a gun. we describe the design considerations for claw and evaluate its performance through two user studies. the first study obtained qualitative user feedback on the naturalness, effectiveness, and comfort when using the device. the second study investigated the ease of the transition between grasping and touching when using our device.",1001.0,651.0,38666.0
"writing is a common task for crowdsourcing researchers exploring complex and creative work. to better understand how we write with crowds, we conducted both a literature review of crowd-writing systems and structured interviews with designers of such systems. we argue that the cognitive process theory of writing described by flower and hayes (1981), originally proposed as a theory of how solo writers write, offers a useful analytic lens for examining the design of crowd-writing systems. this lens enabled us to identify system design challenges that are inherent to the process of writing as well as design challenges that are introduced by crowdsourcing. the findings present both similarities and differences between how solo writers write versus how we write with crowds. to conclude, we discuss how the research community might apply and transcend the cognitive process model to identify opportunities for future research in crowd-writing systems.","alternatives to appropriating everyday surfaces for touch input include the use of explicit touch surfaces on personal computing devices like smartphones, smart watches, or head-mounted displays, or the instrumentation of environmental objects with optical, acoustic, electric impedance tomography, or capacitive sensors.","paper continues to be a versatile and indispensable material in the 21st century. of course, paper is a passive medium with no inherent interactivity, precluding us from computationally-enhancing a wide variety of paper-based activities. in this work, we present a new technical approach for bringing the digital and paper worlds closer together, by enabling paper to track finger input and also drawn input with writing implements. importantly, for paper to still be considered paper, our method had to be very low cost. this necessitated research into materials, fabrication methods and sensing techniques. we describe the outcome of our investigations and show that our method can be sufficiently low-cost and accurate to enable new interactive opportunities with this pervasive and venerable material.",1036.0,116.0,133.0
"we propose and evaluate a novel interaction technique to enhance physical keyboard shortcuts with arm and wrist rotation gestures, performed during keypresses: rolling the wrist, rotating the arm/wrist, and lifting it. this extends the set of shortcuts from key combinations (e.g. ctrl + v) to combinations of key(s) and gesture (e.g. v + roll left) and enables continuous control. we implement this approach for isolated single keypresses, using inertial sensors of a smartwatch. we investigate key aspects in three studies: 1) rotation flexibility per keystroke finger, 2) rotation control, and 3) user-defined gesture shortcuts. as a use case, we employ our technique in a painting application and assess user experience. overall, results show that arm and wrist rotations during keystrokes can be used for interaction, yet challenges remain for integration into practical applications. we discuss recommendations for applications and ideas for future research.","one potential method to address this is to analyze user responses and identify different semantic themes, similar to the data-driven methods used by others to recognize the semantic themes in user input.","interview chatbots engage users in a text-based conversation to draw out their views and opinions. it is, however, challenging to build effective interview chatbots that can handle user free-text responses to open-ended questions and deliver engaging user experience. as the first step, we are investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of using publicly available, practical ai technologies to build effective interview chatbots. to demonstrate feasibility, we built a prototype scoped to enable interview chatbots with a subset of active listening skills-the abilities to comprehend a user's input and respond properly. to evaluate the effectiveness of our prototype, we compared the performance of interview chatbots with or without active listening skills on four common interview topics in a live evaluation with 206 users. our work presents practical design implications for building effective interview chatbots, hybrid chatbot platforms, and empathetic chatbots beyond interview tasks.",20.0,728.0,23588.0
"effective use of data involving personal or sensitive information often requires different people to have access to personal information, which significantly reduces the personal privacy of those whose data is stored and increases risk of identity theft, data leaks, or social engineering attacks. our research studies the tradeoffs between privacy and utility of personal information for human decision making. using a record-linkage scenario, this paper presents a controlled study of how varying degrees of information availability influences the ability to effectively use personal information. we compared the quality of human decision-making using a visual interface that controls the amount of personal information available using visual markup to highlight data discrepancies. with this interface, study participants who viewed only 30% of data content had decision quality similar to those who had full 100% access. the results demonstrate that it is possible to greatly limit the amount of personal information available to human decision makers without negatively affecting utility or human effectiveness. however, the findings also show there is a limit to how much data can be hidden before negatively influencing the quality of judgment in decisions involving person-level data. despite the reduced accuracy with extreme data hiding, the study demonstrates that with proper interface designs, many correct decisions can be made with even legally de-identified data that is fully masked (74.5% accuracy with fully-masked data compared to 84.1% with full access). thus, when legal requirements only allow for de-identified data access, use of well-designed interface can significantly improve data utility.","furthermore, none of these haptic guidance methods are used to enhance realism in vr guidance, as in other vr haptic research.","we present a new handheld haptic device, thor's hammer, which uses propeller propulsion to generate ungrounded, 3-dof force feedback. thor's hammer has six motors and propellers that generates strong thrusts of air without the need for physical grounding or heavy air compressors. with its location and orientation tracked by an optimal tracking system, the system can exert forces in arbitrary directions regardless of the device's orientation. our technical evaluation shows that thor's hammer can apply up to 4 n of force in arbitrary directions with less than 0.11 n and 3.9° of average magnitude and orientation errors. we also present virtual reality applications that can benefit from the force feedback provided by thor's hammer. using these applications, we conducted a preliminary user study and participants felt the experience more realistic and immersive with the force feedback.",324.0,522.0,7602.0
"significant progress to integrate and analyse multimodal data has been carried out in the last years. yet, little research has tackled the challenge of visualising and supporting the sensemaking of multimodal data to inform teaching and learning. it is naïve to expect that simply by rendering multiple data streams visually, a teacher or learner will be able to make sense of them. this paper introduces an approach to unravel the complexity of multimodal data by organising it into meaningful layers that explain critical insights to teachers and students. the approach is illustrated through the design of two data storytelling prototypes in the context of nursing simulation. two authentic studies with educators and students identified the potential of the approach to create learning analytics interfaces that communicate insights on team performance, as well as concerns in terms of accountability and automated insights discovery.","some projects use certain affordances and stylings of social media to promote communication and sharing, such as a feed of posts and images, and researchers have explored the potential of using social media and networks in the classroom [1,3,48].","a major challenge in education is understanding how to connect learning experiences across settings (e.g., school, afterschool, and home) for youth. in this paper, we introduce and describe the participatory design process we undertook to develop science everywhere (se), which is a sociotechnical system where children share their everyday science learning via social media. public displays installed throughout the neighborhood invite parents, adults, peers, and community members to interact with children's ideas to better develop connections for learning across settings. our case study of community interactions with the public displays illuminate how these technologies encouraged behaviors such as the noticing of children's ideas, recognition of people in the neighborhood, and bridging to new learning opportunities for youth.",745.0,276.0,21468.0
"this paper examines how data-driven performance monitoring technologies affect the work of telecommunications field engineers. as a mobile workforce, this occupational group rely on an array of smartphone applications to plan, manage and report on their jobs, and to liaise remotely with managers and colleagues. these technologies intend to help field engineers be more productive and have greater control over their work; however they also gather data related to the quantity and effectiveness of their labor. we conducted a qualitative study examining engineers' experiences of these systems. our findings suggest they simultaneously enhance worker autonomy, support co-ordination with and monitoring of colleagues, but promote anxieties around productivity and the interpretation of data by management. we discuss the implications of data-driven performance management technologies on worker agency, and examine the consequences of such systems in an era of quantified workplaces.","we draw our theoretical framework from motive disposition theory (mdt), a theory that describes three basic motives (the big three), i.e., affiliation, achievement, and power.","we introduce explicit and implicit motives (i.e., achievement, affiliation, power, autonomy) into player experience research and situate them in existing theories of player motivation, personality, playstyle, and experience. additionally, we conducted an experiment with 109 players in a social play situation and show that: 1. as expected, there are several correlations of playstyle, personality, and motivation with explicit motives, but few with implicit motives; 2. the implicit affiliation motive predicts in-game social behaviour; and 3. the implicit affiliation motive adds significant variance to explain regression models of in-game social behaviours even when we control for social aspects of personality, the explicit affiliation motive, self-esteem, and social player traits. our results support that implicit motives explain additional variance because they access needs that are experienced affectively and pre-consciously, and not through cognitive interpretation necessary for explicit expression and communication, as is the case in any approaches that use self-report.",369.0,188.0,6217.0

"how does group membership framing affect the feedback students provide learners? this paper presents two between-subjects experiments investigating the effect of ingroup/outgroup membership on effort spent in peer evaluations, and whether the group membership criterion type affects quality and stringency of evaluation. two peer-review assignments were implemented in two separate classes. in the first study, students were nominally grouped by location they sat in class and non-nominally grouped by current class score; each was asked to review an ingroup and outgroup peer assignment. a second study randomly assigned students to one of four group types (random, score, motivation, and location); student reviewed two ingroup assignments. in both studies, score-grouped students graded their peers more stringently than students grouped by location. these studies illustrate for system designers the impacts of group framing - and the disclosure of that-in peer review tasks.",our pricing is also roughly in line with recent closely related ivr-based pilot studies conducted in india (we paid approximately $0.042 per question and approximately $8.43 per hour after accounting for airtime costs compared to $0.046 per question for learn2earn and $9.81 per hour in the case of recall).,"in rural parts of the developing world, spreading awareness about critical issues in health, governance, and other topics is challenging and costly. traditional media such as print, radio and tv each have limitations and offer little guarantee that new information is absorbed or retained by the target population. this paper describes learn2earn, a system that leverages mobile payments to bolster public awareness campaigns in rural india. users call an interactive voice response (ivr) system, listen to a brief audio tutorial, and take a multiple-choice quiz to check their understanding. people who pass the quiz receive a mobile top-up (about $0.14) and have the opportunity to earn additional credits by referring others to the system. we describe a pilot deployment of learn2earn in rural india that spread via word-of-mouth to over 15,000 people within seven weeks. usage was concentrated among young men, many of them students. in a mixed-methods study, we draw upon call logs, electronic surveys, qualitative interviews, and other sources of data to suggest that learn2earn could be an effective way to build awareness about important topics.",812.0,869.0,34990.0

"we present a mobile system that enhances mixed reality experiences and games with force feedback by means of electrical muscle stimulation (ems). the benefit of our approach is that it adds physical forces while keeping the users' hands free to interact unencumbered-not only with virtual objects, but also with physical objects, such as props and appliances. we demonstrate how this supports three classes of applications along the mixed-reality continuum: (1) entirely virtual objects, such as furniture with ems friction when pushed or an ems-based catapult game. (2) virtual objects augmented via passive props with ems-constraints, such as a light control panel made tangible by means of a physical cup or a balance-the-marble game with an actuated tray. (3) augmented appliances with virtual behaviors, such as a physical thermostat dial with ems-detents or an escape-room that repurposes lamps as levers with detents. we present a user-study in which participants rated the ems-feedback as significantly more realistic than a no-ems baseline.","but there is nothing inherently misleading about many of the dark patterns described in the literature, such as conti and sobiesk's coercion and forced work patterns, gray et al.’s forced action dark pattern, or mathur et al.’s obstruction pattern.","dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions. we present automated techniques that enable experts to identify dark patterns on a large set of websites. using these techniques, we study shopping websites, which often use dark patterns to influence users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. analyzing ~53k product pages from ~11k shopping websites, we discover 1,818 dark pattern instances, together representing 15 types and 7 broader categories. we examine these dark patterns for deceptive practices, and find 183 websites that engage in such practices. we also uncover 22 third-party entities that offer dark patterns as a turnkey solution. finally, we develop a taxonomy of dark pattern characteristics that describes the underlying influence of the dark patterns and their potential harm on user decision-making. based on our findings, we make recommendations for stakeholders including researchers and regulators to study, mitigate, and minimize the use of these patterns.",443.0,901.0,21912.0
"toxicity in online discussions has been an intriguing phenomenon and an important problem. in this paper, we seek to better understand toxicity dynamics in online discussions via a case study on reddit that explores the antecedents and consequences of toxicity in text. we inspected two dimensions of toxicity: language toxicity, i.e. how toxic the text itself is; and toxicity elicitation, i.e. how much toxicity it elicits in its response. through regression analyses on reddit comments, we found that both author propensity and toxicity in discussion context were strong positive antecedents of language toxicity; meanwhile, language toxicity significantly increased the volume and user evaluation of the discussion in some sub-communities, while toxicity elicitation showed mixed effects. we then discuss how our results help understand and regulate toxicity in online discussions by interpreting the complicated triggers and outcomes of toxicity.","a growing body of work in hci has been looking at how to engage with biosensors creatively and designerly, including explorations on sensing technologies through collaborations with dancers and choreographers, surfacing the material properties of biosensors, or studying how sensor data can be appropriated in everyday life.","emotional biosensing is rising in daily life: data and categories claim to know how people feel and suggest what they should do about it, while cscw explores new biosensing possibilities. prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. we contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. in particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. we call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, 'the good life,' and everyday experience.",973.0,836.0,16033.0
"to better understand how we can broaden participation in computing, this exploratory study examines the interview process for elite internships at established technology companies. through conducting 36 interviews with evaluators at technology companies, we find that in addition to technical competence, evaluators often assess internship applicants based on explicit and implicit signals of industrial fit, organizational fit, and individual fit. these evaluative criteria are reminiscent of prior literature linking biases in hiring to social class background. by reflecting on how our findings relate to previous studies, we suggest that evaluators? assessments of fit are potentially linked to social class background, and this might be an invisible factor contributing to hiring biases at technology companies. given that hiring only culturally similar employees can have negative individual, organizational, and societal consequences, we propose strategies for evaluators to broaden their evaluation perspectives and to enact inclusive interviewing practices. we conclude with a call for further research on the role of social class background in the hiring process.","the majority of work to date, including in the area of text entry, focuses on the relatively mature form factor of the smartwatch and deals with two-handed use — the watch is worn on one wrist and its screen tapped by the other hand.","smartwatches enable rapid access to information anytime and anywhere. however, current smartwatch content navigation techniques, for panning and zooming, were directly adopted from those used on smartphones. these techniques are cumbersome when performed on small smartwatch screens and have not been evaluated for their support in mobility and encumbrance contexts (when the user's hands are busy). we studied the effect of mobility and encumbrance on common content navigation techniques and found a significant decrease in performance as the pace of mobility increases or when the user was encumbered with busy hands. based on these initial findings, we proposed a design space which would improve efficiency when navigation techniques, such as panning and zooming, are employed in mobility contexts. our results reveal that our design space can effectively be used to create novel interaction techniques that improve smartwatch content navigation in mobility and encumbrance contexts.",1008.0,631.0,16942.0

"how does the number of collaborators affect individual productivity? results of prior research have been conflicting, with some studies reporting an increase in individual productivity as the number of collaborators grows, while other studies showing that the free-rider effect skews the effort invested by individuals, making larger groups less productive. the difference between these schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their efficiency. we address this question by studying two planetary-scale collaborative systems: github and wikipedia. by analyzing the activity of over 2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics: the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but saturates at larger sizes. this effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the individual level. people tend to do more when collaborating with more people. we propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the non-linearity in collaboration effort. the proposed model is able to explain and predict group work dynamics in github and wikipedia by capturing their maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a principled, data-driven science of collaboration.",a reason for this discrepancy could be that today's voice assistants often do not live up to user expectations.,"voice user interfaces (vuis) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via 'assistant' devices. yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. by collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the amazon echo in participants' homes-informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis-our study documents the methodical practices of vui users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. we discuss how the vui is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. finally, we locate implications for the accountability of vui interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing 'conversational' interfaces.",894.0,637.0,15088.0

"an understanding of medical diagnosis as it is practiced is essential for those seeking to support it using intelligent systems. through the case of epilepsy, we show that diagnosis is a situated, relational, and evolving process that accounts for information well beyond the patient's physiology, even for physiological phenomena like seizures. through observations and interviews with neurologists, we show that the meaning of brainwaves and other physiological data depends upon a range of patient-specific and contextual factors, such as age, comorbidities, and mealtimes. further, we show that diagnosis is partly determined by social factors such as the activities of caregivers and other clinicians, and environmental factors such as faulty electrical wiring. additionally, diagnostic classifications can evolve in response to new information: events that were once considered seizures can be reinterpreted as clinically irrelevant and vice versa. we contribute a broader sociotechnical perspective to literature on intelligent decision making in healthcare and discuss implications for the design of decision support systems that can better support the work of medical diagnosis.","in cvr, fomo refers to the viewers’ concern about missing important parts of the story.","this paper examines the sense of presence, attitude change, perspective-taking, and usability of a split-sphere, first-person perspective 360 degree video about gender inequality, in which people can choose to watch the narrative from the male or female character's perspective. sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to watch (1) the video in 360 degree split-view in a head-mounted display, (2) the same film as 180 degree in a hmd, or (3) a flat control version of the video on a laptop. the 360 degree split-sphere increased the viewers' feeling of personal responsibility for resolving gender inequality, desire to rewatch the video, fear of missing out, and feeling of missing the full story. the 180 degree video created the strongest sense of presence, embodiment, and understanding of the character. however, people with greater egocentric projection onto the male character felt less responsible for resolving gender inequality, particularly in the 360 degree split-view.",1024.0,542.0,30771.0
"open online communities rely on social norms for behavior regulation, group cohesion, and sustainability. research on the role of social norms online has mainly focused on one source of influence at a time, making it difficult to separate different normative influences and understand their interactions. in this study, we use the focus theory to examine interactions between several sources of normative influence in a wikipedia sub-community: local descriptive norms, local injunctive norms, and norms imported from similar sub-communities. we find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior. we contextualize these findings through member interviews, and discuss their implications for both future research on normative influence in online groups and the design of systems that support open collaboration.","in our context, the goal is to improve the overall quality of an individual's opinion, when users are asked to think about a public issue.","online deliberation offers a way for citizens to collectively discuss an issue and provide input for policymakers. the overall experience of online deliberation can be affected by multiple factors. we decided to investigate the effects of moderation and opinion heterogeneity on the perceived deliberation experience, by running the first online deliberation experiment in singapore. our study took place in three months with three phases. in phase 1, our 2,006 participants answered a survey, that we used to create groups of different opinion heterogeneity. during the second phase, 510 participants discussed about the population issue on the online platform we developed. we gathered data on their online deliberation experience during phase 3. we found out that higher levels of moderation negatively impact the experience of deliberation on perceived procedural fairness, validity claim and policy legitimacy; and that high opinion heterogeneity is important in order to get a fair assessment of the deliberation experience.",819.0,681.0,43102.0
"preparing for exams is an important yet stressful time for many students. self-testing is known to be an effective preparation strategy, yet some students lack motivation to engage or persist in self-testing activities. adding game elements to a platform supporting self-testing may increase engagement and, by extension, exam performance. we conduct a randomized controlled experiment (n=701) comparing the effect of two game elements -- a points system and a badge system -- used individually and in combination. we find that the badge system elicits significantly higher levels of voluntary self-testing activity and this effect is particularly pronounced amongst a relatively small cohort. importantly, this increased activity translates to a significant improvement in exam scores. our data supports a causal relationship between gamification and learning outcomes, mediated by self-testing behavior. this provides empirical support for landers' theory of gamified learning when the gamified activity is conducted prior to measuring learning outcomes.","peer support networks following the conclusion of behaviour change interventions are one attempt to extend the life of these relationships as these require peers to share emotional, social or practical advice, whether located in-person or hosted online.","talk therapy is a common, effective, and desirable form of mental health treatment. yet, it is inaccessible to many people. enabling peers to chat online using effective principles of talk therapy could help scale this form of mental health care. to understand how such chats could be designed, we conducted a two-week field experiment with 40 people experiencing mental illnesses comparing two types of online chats-chats guided by prompts, and unguided chats. results show that anxiety was significantly reduced from pre-test to post-test. user feedback revealed that guided chats provided solutions to problems and new perspectives, and were perceived as ""deep,"" while unguided chats offered personal connection on shared experiences and were experienced as ""smooth."" we contribute the design of an online guided chat tool and insights into the design of peer support chat systems that guide users to initiate, maintain, and reciprocate emotional support.",309.0,329.0,43296.0
"ot (operational transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. crdt (commutative replicated data type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of woot (without operational transformation). follow-up crdt variations are commonly labeled as ""post-ot"" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors. on top of that, crdt solutions have made broad claims of superiority over ot solutions, and often portrayed ot as an incorrect and inefficient technique. over one decade later, however, crdt is rarely found in working co-editors; ot remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. contradictions between the reality and crdt's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. to seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative ot and crdt solutions and working co-editors based on them. from this work, we have made important discoveries about ot and crdt, and revealed facts and evidences that refute crdt claims over ot on all accounts. these discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between ot and crdt in the real world. we report these results in a series of three articles. in this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between ot and crdt in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative crdt solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of ot and crdt. we hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding ot and crdt, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.","therefore, a large body of work in the vr field has focused on conveying as much tangible information as possible from the real to the virtual world leading to more immersive experiences – for instance, rendering objects properties such as size, shape, texture, and weight.","we present haptic revolver, a handheld virtual reality controller that renders fingertip haptics when interacting with virtual surfaces. haptic revolver's core haptic element is an actuated wheel that raises and lowers underneath the finger to render contact with a virtual surface. as the user's finger moves along the surface of an object, the controller spins the wheel to render shear forces and motion under the fingertip. the wheel is interchangeable and can contain physical textures, shapes, edges, or active elements to provide different sensations to the user. because the controller is spatially tracked, these physical features can be spatially registered with the geometry of the virtual environment and rendered on-demand. we evaluated haptic revolver in two studies to understand how wheel speed and direction impact perceived realism. we also report qualitative feedback from users who explored three application scenarios with our controller.",905.0,85.0,12856.0

"biosensing displays, increasingly enrolled in emotional reflection, promise authoritative insight by presenting users' emotions as discrete categories. rather than machines interpreting emotions, we sought to explore an alternative with emotional biosensing displays in which users formed their own interpretations and felt comfortable critiquing the display. so, we designed, implemented, and deployed, as a technology probe, an emotional biosensory display: ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes color responding to the wearer's skin conductance, which is associated with excitement. 17 participants wore ripple over 2 days of daily life. while some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' ripple provided between body and emotion, for others ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had. despite our design intentions, we found participants rarely questioned the display's relation to their feelings. using biopolitics to speculate on ripple's surprising authority, we highlight ethical stakes of biosensory representations for sense of self and ways of feeling.","for example, a smartwatch application for people with idds aimed to change behavior by “notifying the student to keep [himself]/herself focused, to ask or answer questions, to participate in group discussions and to moderate his/her voice (speaking more or less loudly)”, while for autistic students: “mosoco suggests skill appropriate do's (e.g., “smile if somebody looks at you”) and don'ts (e.g., “don't stare”)”.","smartwatches have a large potential to support everyday activities. however, their potential as assistive technologies in inclusive academic environments is unclear. to investigate how smartwatches can support students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (idds) to perform activities that require emotional and behavioral skills and involve communication, collaboration and planning, we implemented weli. weli (wearable life) is a wearable application designed to assist young adults with idds attending a postsecondary education program. this paper reports on the user-centric design process adopted in the development of weli, and describes how smartwatches can assist students with idds in special education. the results reported are drawn from 8 user studies with 58 participants in total. weli features include behavioral intervention, mood regulation, reminders, checklists, surveys and rewards. results indicate that several considerations must be taken into account when designing for students with idd, and that overall the students are enthusiastic about adopting an innovative smartwatch application in class, as they reacted positively about the technology and features provided.",428.0,348.0,22554.0
"type 1 diabetes is a potentially life-threatening chronic condition that requires frequent interactions with diverse data to inform treatment decisions. while mobile technologies such as blood glucose meters have long been an essential part of this process, designing interfaces that explicitly support decision-making remains challenging. dual-process models are a common approach to understanding such cognitive tasks. however, evidence from the first of two studies we present suggests that in demanding and complex situations, some individuals approach disease management in distinctive ways that do not seem to fit well within existing models. this finding motivated, and helped frame our second study, a survey (n=192) to investigate these behaviors in more detail. on the basis of the resulting analysis, we posit fluid contextual reasoning to explain how some people with diabetes respond to particular situations, and discuss how an extended framework might help inform the design of user interfaces for diabetes management.","lastly, it is possible to design social vr environments that offer rich experiences akin to those people enjoy face-to-face, such as photo sharing, or the exchange of objects among virtually co-located users .","social virtual reality (social vr) is an emerging technology that has the potential to support unique social experiences for groups of older adults. in this paper we explore the use of social vr to support group reminiscence, an activity that has been shown to have a positive impact on the lives of older adults. we developed school days, a bespoke social vr application that enables groups of geographically dispersed older adults to meet in a virtual environment to reminisce about their school experiences. we conducted a user study over the course of 5 months with 16 participants aged 70--81 to evaluate how school days supported reminiscence. in this paper, we focus on how the use of reminiscence scaffolding features in school days impacted on the older adults' ability to participate more fully in the reminiscence activities. our results illustrate the value of social vr for connecting older adults over distance, and contribute new knowledge of how virtual environments can be designed to scaffold reminiscence; how techniques such as 3d conversation starters and individual artefacts can be used to scaffold reminiscence; and how pre-recorded holographic stories (avacasts) can be used to introduce new perspectives and prompt self-reflection. we contribute five design reflections aimed at guiding the design of future reminiscence tools in social vr.",622.0,1074.0,29761.0
"end-to-end latency corresponds to the temporal difference between a user input and the corresponding output from a system. it has been shown to degrade user performance in both direct and indirect interaction. if it can be reduced to some extend, latency can also be compensated through software compensation by trying to predict the future position of the cursor based on previous positions, velocities and accelerations. in this paper, we propose a hybrid hardware and software prediction technique specifically designed for partially compensating end-to-end latency in indirect pointing. we combine a computer mouse with a high frequency accelerometer to predict the future location of the pointer using euler based equations. our prediction method results in more accurate prediction than previously introduced prediction algorithms for direct touch. a controlled experiment also revealed that it can improve target acquisition time in pointing tasks.","moreover, considering that the complexity of the background image (i.e., how many special objects and shapes it has) tends to influence users’ choices, we selected different types of background images (subsection 4.3.6).","visual attention, search, processing and comprehension are important cognitive tasks during a graphical password composition activity. aiming to shed light on whether individual differences on visual behavior affect the strength of the created passwords, we conducted an eye-tracking study (n=36), and adopted an accredited cognitive style theory to interpret the results. the analysis revealed that users with different cognitive styles followed different patterns of visual behavior which affected the strength of the created passwords. motivated, by the results of the first study, we introduced adaptive characteristics to the user authentication mechanism, aiming to assist specific cognitive style user groups to create more secure passwords, and conducted a second study with a new sample (n=40) to test the adaptive characteristics. results strengthen our assumptions that adaptive mechanisms based on users' differences in cognitive and visual behavior uncover a new perspective for improving the password's strength within graphical user authentication realms.",606.0,86.0,6428.0

"through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.","beyond ui element detection, recent data-driven design work relies on large ui design datasets to infer higher level interface semantics, such as design patterns, flows, and tags.","design sharing sites provide ui designers with a platform to share their works and also an opportunity to get inspiration from others' designs. to facilitate management and search of millions of ui design images, many design sharing sites adopt collaborative tagging systems by distributing the work of categorization to the community. however, designers often do not know how to properly tag one design image with compact textual description, resulting in unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent tags for uploaded examples which impede retrieval, according to our empirical study and interview with four professional designers. based on a deep neural network, we introduce a novel approach for encoding both the visual and textual information to recover the missing tags for existing ui examples so that they can be more easily found by text queries. we achieve 82.72% accuracy in the tag prediction. through a simulation test of 5 queries, our system on average returns hundreds more results than the default dribbble search, leading to better relatedness, diversity and satisfaction.",709.0,988.0,16561.0

"the wide adoption of machine learning (ml) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ml models. some advocated the term ""machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ml models. this ""teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-ai interfaces. one promising learning paradigm is active learning (al), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. however, in current al settings, the human-ai interface remains minimal and opaque. a dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for al algorithms. in this work, we begin considering ai explanations as a core element of the human-ai interface for teaching machines. when a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. when a ml model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. when the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (xal), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable ai (xai) into an al setting. we conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with xal, to that of traditional al and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). our study shows benefits of ai explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to ai explanations, including task knowledge, ai experience and need for cognition. by reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for xal, and more broadly, machine teaching through ai explanations.","remixed reality allows users to copy and drag virtually-tracked physical 3d objects, or play and pause the room's full 3d recording similar to an animation.","we present remixed reality, a novel form of mixed reality. in contrast to classical mixed reality approaches where users see a direct view or video feed of their environment, with remixed reality they see a live 3d reconstruction, gathered from multiple external depth cameras. this approach enables changing the environment as easily as geometry can be changed in virtual reality, while allowing users to view and interact with the actual physical world as they would in augmented reality. we characterize a taxonomy of manipulations that are possible with remixed reality: spatial changes such as erasing objects; appearance changes such as changing textures; temporal changes such as pausing time; and viewpoint changes that allow users to see the world from different points without changing their physical location. we contribute a method that uses an underlying voxel grid holding information like visibility and transformations, which is applied to live geometry in real time.",1042.0,128.0,22104.0

"how does the number of collaborators affect individual productivity? results of prior research have been conflicting, with some studies reporting an increase in individual productivity as the number of collaborators grows, while other studies showing that the free-rider effect skews the effort invested by individuals, making larger groups less productive. the difference between these schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their efficiency. we address this question by studying two planetary-scale collaborative systems: github and wikipedia. by analyzing the activity of over 2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics: the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but saturates at larger sizes. this effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the individual level. people tend to do more when collaborating with more people. we propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the non-linearity in collaboration effort. the proposed model is able to explain and predict group work dynamics in github and wikipedia by capturing their maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a principled, data-driven science of collaboration.","first, recent studies show that other researchers have used juji to build various interview chatbots, which matches our focus on aiding the design of effective interview chatbots.","interview chatbots engage users in a text-based conversation to draw out their views and opinions. it is, however, challenging to build effective interview chatbots that can handle user free-text responses to open-ended questions and deliver engaging user experience. as the first step, we are investigating the feasibility and effectiveness of using publicly available, practical ai technologies to build effective interview chatbots. to demonstrate feasibility, we built a prototype scoped to enable interview chatbots with a subset of active listening skills-the abilities to comprehend a user's input and respond properly. to evaluate the effectiveness of our prototype, we compared the performance of interview chatbots with or without active listening skills on four common interview topics in a live evaluation with 206 users. our work presents practical design implications for building effective interview chatbots, hybrid chatbot platforms, and empathetic chatbots beyond interview tasks.",894.0,728.0,23547.0

"the rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. this paper contributes to such research in two ways. first, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. second, through a controlled experimental study on amazon mechanical turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. we studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. these results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.","in hci, researchers have explored the affordances of twitter, facebook, and reddit in supporting disaster awareness and communication.","crisis informatics has examined how institutions and individuals seek, communicate, and curate information in response to crises. the public's communication and perception of risks on social media remain understudied. in this study, we report a qualitative analysis of public perceptions of risks and risk management measures on reddit during the zika crisis, an emerging epidemic associated with high uncertainty regarding pathology, epidemiology, and broad consequences. we found two types of perceived risks: ones directly caused by the zika virus, and ones potentially introduced by authorities' risk management measures. risk perceptions unfolded along multiple dimensions beyond the imminent and personal level. reddit users discussed in a speculative way to foresee various risks in the long run or at larger geographical scales. we discuss the multidimensionality and speculative nature of risk perception on social media, and derive implications for crisis informatics research and public health research and practice.",870.0,212.0,20412.0

"topotext is a context-preserving technique for visualizing text data for multi-scale spatial aggregates to gain insight into spatial phenomena. conventional exploration requires users to navigate across multiple scales but only presents the information related to the current scale. this limitation potentially adds more steps of interaction and cognitive overload to the users. topotext renders multi-scale aggregates into a single visual display combining novel text-based encoding and layout methods that draw labels along the boundary or filled within the aggregates. the text itself not only summarizes the semantics at each individual scale, but also indicates the spatial coverage of the aggregates and their underlying hierarchical relationships. we validate topotext with both a user study as well as several application examples.","in addition to the standard interaction method, there are some techniques based on commercially available devices, such as capacitive screen-based interaction (e.g., pre-touch, eartouch), camera-based interaction (e.g., lip-interact, frownonerror) and microphone-based interaction (e.g., siri, earbuddy).","interacting with a smartphone using touch input and speech output is challenging for visually impaired people in mobile and public scenarios, where only one hand may be available for input (e.g., while holding a cane) and using the loudspeaker for speech output is constrained by environmental noise, privacy, and social concerns. to address these issues, we propose eartouch, a one-handed interaction technique that allows the users to interact with a smartphone using the ear to perform gestures on the touchscreen. users hold the phone to their ears and listen to speech output from the ear speaker privately. we report how the technique was designed, implemented, and evaluated through a series of studies. results show that eartouch is easy, efficient, fun and socially acceptable to use.",36.0,688.0,30378.0
"we present wristext - a one-handed text entry technique for smartwatches using the joystick-like motion of the wrist. a user enters text by whirling the wrist of the watch hand, towards six directions which each represent a key in a circular keyboard, and where the letters are distributed in an alphabetical order. the design of wristext was an iterative process, where we first conducted a study to investigate optimal key size, and found that keys needed to be 55º or wider to achieve over 90% striking accuracy. we then computed an optimal keyboard layout, considering a joint optimization problem of striking accuracy, striking comfort, word disambiguation. we evaluated the performance of wristext through a five-day study with 10 participants in two text entry scenarios: hand-up and hand-down. on average, participants achieved a text entry speed of 9.9 wpm across all sessions, and were able to type as fast as 15.2 wpm by the end of the last day.","previous studies of status sharing have consistently found that individuals prefer to appear either away or offline, i.e., to remain “invisible”.","while mobile instant messaging (mim) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. we examine two design concepts for mim-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. we built mybutler, an android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with kakaotalk, a commercial mim app. during a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. we reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in mim communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of mim users in choosing whether to alert their messages. in terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. we found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations.",179.0,918.0,39285.0
"the premise of a primary key is simple enough: every record or row in a table should have some number or string that can uniquely identify it. primary keys are essential for linking data spread across database tables, and for looking up and retrieving data from specific records. yet for an identifier that seems so straightforward and uncontroversial, we find myriad ways that this unassuming bit of infrastructure has an outsized influence in human services work. through case studies of the organizational networks of two nonprofit human services organizations, we find that different stakeholders use variants of identifiers to support work practices that are far more complex and social than the linking of tables or the lookup of data. yet we also find that the low-level technical properties of the primary key are often coercive, forcing end-users to work on the infrastructure's terms-influencing the nature and order of the work, creating new forms of work, and influencing the tenor of the relationships among stakeholders. the technical abstractions of the underlying infrastructure, then, start to become the de facto public policy. we conclude by offering design provocations for better supporting identification across a variety of contexts.","prior literature found that student designers may attribute value to feedback along a number of different criteria, such as the feedback's quantity, specificity, criticality, valence, affect, or sentiment, helpfulness, fairness, and actionability.","examples provide a source of inspiration for creating designs, but can they help improve the feedback process? supplementing design feedback with examples could help recipients see issues clearly, identify concrete steps for improvement, and integrate novel ideas. two online studies investigated how to support novices providing feedback on visual poster designs in an online context. study one found that feedback providers select poster examples that complement their feedback and align with a provided rubric. study two shows that feedback providers give more specific, actionable, and novel input when using an example-centric approach, as opposed to text alone. to support this, we designed paragon, an interface to efficiently browse examples using metadata. finally, we discuss implications for collecting examples from the web and structuring the design feedback process.",871.0,603.0,35043.0

"crowd-powered conversational assistants have been shown to be more robust than automated systems, but do so at the cost of higher response latency and monetary costs. a promising direction is to combine the two approaches for high quality, low latency, and low cost solutions. in this paper, we introduce evorus, a crowd-powered conversational assistant built to automate itself over time by (i) allowing new chatbots to be easily integrated to automate more scenarios, (ii) reusing prior crowd answers, and (iii) learning to automatically approve response candidates. our 5-month-long deployment with 80 participants and 281 conversations shows that evorus can automate itself without compromising conversation quality. crowd-ai architectures have long been proposed as a way to reduce cost and latency for crowd-powered systems; evorus demonstrates how automation can be introduced successfully in a deployed system. its architecture allows future researchers to make further innovation on the underlying automated components in the context of a deployed open domain dialog system.","some research focuses on people with disabilities, creating assistive devices [31,38] and accessible personalized art pieces.","we describe our experience of working with blind and visually impaired people to create interactive art objects that are personal to them, through a participatory making process using electronic textiles (e-textiles) and hands-on crafting techniques. the research addresses both the practical considerations about how to structure hands-on making workshops in a way which is accessible to participants of varying experience and abilities, and how effective the approach was in enabling participants to tell their own stories and feel in control of the design and making process. the results of our analysis is the offering of insights in how to run e-textile making sessions in such a way for them to be more accessible and inclusive to a wider community of participants.",293.0,467.0,36444.0
"in augmented and virtual reality (ar and vr), there may be many 3d planar windows with 2d texts, images, and videos on them. however, managing the position, orientation, and scale of such a window in an immersive 3d workspace can be difficult. projective windows strategically uses the absolute and apparent sizes of the window at various stages of the interaction to enable the grabbing, moving, scaling, and releasing of the window in one continuous hand gesture. with it, the user can quickly and intuitively manage and interact with windows in space without any controller hardware or dedicated widget. through an evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique is performant and preferable, and that projective geometry plays an important role in the design of spatial user interfaces.","typically, it can be used as a way to focus on specific aspects of an illustration such as emphasising motion or highlighting touch contact points (with coloured circles) or a specific area.","many recent studies have explored user-defined interactions for touch and gesture-based systems through end-user elicitation. while these studies have facilitated the user-end of the human-computer dialogue, the subsequent design of gesture representations to communicate gestures to the user vary in style and consistency. our study explores how users interpret, enact, and refine gesture representations adapting techniques from recent elicitation studies. to inform our study design, we analyzed gesture representations from 30 elicitation papers and developed a taxonomy of design elements. we then conducted a partnered elicitation study with 30 participants producing 657 gesture representations accompanied by think-aloud data. we discuss design patterns and themes that emerged from our analysis, and supplement these findings with an in-depth look at users' mental models when perceiving and enacting gesture representations. finally, based on the results, we provide recommendations for practitioners in need of ""visual language"" guidelines to communicate possible user actions.",216.0,544.0,11037.0
"self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. we explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. we qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. we found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. we discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. we also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area.","these works are particularly concerned with the specific emotions players feel (or at least report feeling) while playing, ranging from awe and respect to sadness, regret, and disgust.","recent work introduced the notion of emotional challenge as a means to afford more unique and diverse gaming experiences. however, players' experience of emotional challenge has received little empirical attention. it remains unclear whether players enjoy it and what exactly constitutes the challenge thereof. we surveyed 171 players about a challenging or an emotionally challenging experience, and analyzed their responses with regards to what made the experience challenging, their emotional response, and the relation to core player experience constructs. we found that emotional challenge manifested itself in different ways, by confronting players with difficult themes or decisions, as well as having them deal with intense emotions. in contrast to more'conventional' challenge, emotional challenge evoked a wider range of negative emotions and was appreciated significantly more by players. our findings showcase the appeal of uncomfortable gaming experiences, and extend current conceptualizations of challenge in games.",807.0,40.0,6933.0
"contemporary choreographers often interact directly with dancers when exploring their ideas, but lack adequate tools for capturing and documenting their work. although our first study of choreographers and dancers revealed diverse strategies for recording choreographic fragments, we found that they all worked in terms of constraints, which they represented via spatial diagrams, as movement qualities or with their own personal notation system. this led to the design of knotation, a mobile pen-based tool that lets choreographers sketch their own representations of choreographic ideas and render them interactive. in study two, knotation served as a technology probe to support the contrasting practices of three professional choreographers. we revised knotation based on their input, and ran a third structured observation study with six professional choreographers. knotation easily supported both dance-then-record and record-then-dance strategies. participants used and appropriated knotation's advanced features, including the combination of interactive timelines and floorplan diagrams, to represent and explore complex choreographic structures.","in comparison, related work found that structuring and scaffolding can improve the feedback's perceived usefulness.","good feedback is critical to creativity and learning, yet rare. many people do not know how to actually provide effective feedback. there is increasing demand for quality feedback -- and thus feedback givers -- in learning and professional settings. this paper contributes empirical evidence that two interactive techniques -- reusable suggestions and adaptive guidance -- can improve feedback on creative work. we present these techniques embodied in the critiquekit system to help reviewers give specific, actionable, and justified feedback. two real-world deployment studies and two controlled experiments with critiquekit found that adaptively-presented suggestions improve the quality of feedback from novice reviewers. reviewers also reported that suggestions and guidance helped them describe their thoughts and reminded them to provide effective feedback.",445.0,54.0,34724.0
"an important concern in end user development (eud) is accidentally embedding personal information in program artifacts when sharing them. this issue is particularly important in gui-based programming-by-demonstration (pbd) systems due to the lack of direct developer control of script contents. prior studies reported that these privacy concerns were the main barrier to script sharing in eud. we present a new approach that can identify and obfuscate the potential personal information in gui-based pbd scripts based on the uniqueness of information entries with respect to the corresponding app gui context. compared with the prior approaches, ours supports broader types of personal information beyond explicitly pre-specified ones, requires minimal user effort, addresses the threat of re-identification attacks, and can work with third-party apps from any task domain. our approach also recovers obfuscated fields locally on the script consumer's side to preserve the shared scripts' transparency, readability, robustness, and generalizability. our evaluation shows that our approach (1) accurately identifies the potential personal information in scripts across different apps in diverse task domains; (2) allows end-user developers to feel comfortable sharing their own scripts; and (3) enables script consumers to understand the operation of shared scripts despite the obfuscated fields.","we argue that the human-ai collaboration paradigm is also emerging in the data science domain, as in many other domains (e.g., education, healthcare, human resource).","we are interested in increasing the ability of groups to collaborate efficiently by leveraging new advances in ai and conversational agent (ca) technology. given the longstanding debate on the necessity of embodiment for cas, bringing them to groups requires answering the questions of whether and how providing a ca with a face affects its interaction with the humans in a group. we explored these questions by comparing group decision-making sessions facilitated by an embodied agent, versus a voice-only agent. results of an experiment with 20 user groups revealed that while the embodiment improved various aspects of group's social perception of the agent (e.g., rapport, trust, intelligence, and power), its impact on the group-decision process and outcome was nuanced. drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss the pros and cons of embodiment, argue that the value of having a face depends on the types of assistance the agent provides, and lay out directions for future research.",944.0,389.0,4445.0
"computer-based conversational agents are becoming ubiquitous. however, for these systems to be engaging and valuable to the user, they must be able to express emotion, in addition to providing informative responses. humans rely on much more than language during conversations; visual information is key to providing context. we present the first example of an image-grounded conversational agent using visual sentiment, facial expression and scene features. we show that key qualities of the generated dialogue can be manipulated by the features used for training the agent. we evaluate our model on a large and very challenging real-world dataset of conversations from social media (twitter). the image-grounding leads to significantly more informative, emotional and specific responses, and the exact qualities can be tuned depending on the image features used. furthermore, our model improves the objective quality of dialogue responses when evaluated on standard natural language metrics.","second, displaying uncertainty in predictions can help users can make more optimal decisions.","everyday predictive systems typically present point predictions, making it hard for people to account for uncertainty when making decisions. evaluations of uncertainty displays for transit prediction have assessed people's ability to extract probabilities, but not the quality of their decisions. in a controlled, incentivized experiment, we had subjects decide when to catch a bus using displays with textual uncertainty, uncertainty visualizations, or no-uncertainty (control). frequency-based visualizations previously shown to allow people to better extract probabilities (quantile dotplots) yielded better decisions. decisions with quantile dotplots with 50 outcomes were(1) better on average, having expected payoffs 97% of optimal(95% ci: [95%,98%]), 5 percentage points more than control (95% ci: [2,8]); and (2) more consistent, having within-subject standard deviation of 3 percentage points (95% ci:[2,4]), 4 percentage points less than control (95% ci: [2,6]).cumulative distribution function plots performed nearly as well, and both outperformed textual uncertainty, which was sensitive to the probability interval communicated. we discuss implications for real time transit predictions and possible generalization to other domains.",275.0,143.0,4532.0
"advances in computer vision and machine learning are changing the way people dress and buy clothes. given the vast space of fashion problems, where can data-driven technologies provide the most value? to understand consumer pain points and opportunities for technological interventions, this paper presents the results from two independent need-finding studies that explore the gold-standard of personalized shopping: interacting with a personal stylist. through interviews with five personal stylists, we study the range of problems they address and their in-person processes for working with clients. in a separate study, we investigate how styling experiences map to online settings by building and releasing a chatbot that connects users to one-on-one sessions with a stylist, acquiring more than 70 organic users in three weeks. these conversations reveal that in-person and online styling sessions share similar goals, but online sessions often involve smaller problems that can be resolved more quickly. based on these explorations, we propose future highly personalized, online interactions that address consumer trust and uncertainty, and discuss opportunities for automation.","previous work has shown that current implementations are infrequently used, with people picking one suggestion every 63 characters.","we present a data logging concept, tool, and analyses to facilitate studies of everyday mobile touch keyboard use and free typing behaviour: 1) we propose a filtering concept to log typing without recording readable text and assess reactions to filters with a survey (n=349). 2) we release an android keyboard app and backend that implement this concept. 3) based on a three-week field study (n=30), we present the first analyses of keyboard use and typing biometrics on such free text typing data in the wild, including speed, postures, apps, auto correction, and word suggestions. we conclude that research on mobile keyboards benefits from observing free typing beyond the lab and discuss ideas for further studies.",624.0,253.0,43664.0
"traditional virtual reality (vr) mainly focuses on visual feedback, which is not accessible for people with visual impairments. we created canetroller, a haptic cane controller that simulates white cane interactions, enabling people with visual impairments to navigate a virtual environment by transferring their cane skills into the virtual world. canetroller provides three types of feedback: (1) physical resistance generated by a wearable programmable brake mechanism that physically impedes the controller when the virtual cane comes in contact with a virtual object; (2) vibrotactile feedback that simulates the vibrations when a cane hits an object or touches and drags across various surfaces; and (3) spatial 3d auditory feedback simulating the sound of real-world cane interactions. we designed indoor and outdoor vr scenes to evaluate the effectiveness of our controller. our study showed that canetroller was a promising tool that enabled visually impaired participants to navigate different virtual spaces. we discuss potential applications supported by canetroller ranging from entertainment to mobility training.","to reassure themselves of not being observed, many webcam users thus resort to blocking their webcam's view with stickers or sliding covers, a strategy that has been taken up in the hci literature and extended into solutions using eye-lid or curtain metaphors in interactive systems.","most of today's laptops come with an integrated webcam placed above the screen to enable video conferencing. due to the risk of webcam spying attacks, some laptop users seem to be concerned about their privacy and seek protection by covering the webcam. this paper is the first to investigate personal characteristics and beliefs of users with and without webcam covers by applying the theory of planned behavior. we record the privacy behavior of 180 users, develop a path model, and analyze it by applying partial least squares. the analysis indicates that privacy concerns do not significantly influence users' decision to use a webcam cover. rather, this behavior is influenced by users' attitudes, social environment, and perceived control over protecting privacy. developers should take this as a lesson to design privacy enhancing technologies which are convenient, verifiably effective and endorsed by peers.",115.0,178.0,38260.0

"driving is a task that is often affected by emotions. the effect of emotions on driving has been extensively studied. anger is an emotion that dominates in such investigations. despite the knowledge on strong links between scents and emotions, few studies have explored the effect of olfactory stimulation in a context of driving. such an outcome provides hci practitioners very little knowledge on how to design for emotions using olfactory stimulation in the car. we carried out three studies to select scents of different valence and arousal levels (i.e. rose, peppermint, and civet) and anger eliciting stimuli (i.e. affective pictures and on-road events). we used this knowledge to conduct the fourth user study investigating how the selected scents change the emotional state, well-being, and driving behaviour of drivers in an induced angry state. our findings enable better decisions on what scents to choose when designing interactions for angry drivers.","despite a significant portion of the world's population is associated with different religious beliefs and groups, ‘religion and hci’ is comparatively a new area of exploration.","while persuasion has often been considered an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. this criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. we join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. based on our six-month long ethnography with the islamic communities in a bangladeshi city, kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. we further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of cscw literature in the various domains.",773.0,993.0,5216.0
"privacy and surveillance are central features of public discourse around use of computing systems. as the systems we design and study are increasingly used and regulated as potential instruments of surveillance, hci researchers-even those whose focus is not privacy-find themselves needing to understand privacy in their work. concepts like contextual integrity and boundary regulation have become touchstones for thinking about privacy in hci. in this paper, we draw on hci and privacy literature to understand the limitations of commonly used theories and examine their assumptions, politics, strengths, and weaknesses. we use a case study from the hci literature to illustrate conceptual gaps in existing frameworks where privacy requirements can fall through. finally, we advocate vulnerability as a core concept for privacy theorizing and examine how feminist, queer-marxist, and intersectional thinking may augment our existing repertoire of privacy theories to create a more inclusive scholarship and design practice.","although a growing body of research has successfully applied game design to various disciplines (e.g., health, education, human computation among others) to foster motivation and sustained engagement, player behaviour cannot be predicted solely from motivation, affective computing, or cognitive modeling, as games are a dynamic and ergodic media, i.e., a player interacts with them and alters their state.","preparing for exams is an important yet stressful time for many students. self-testing is known to be an effective preparation strategy, yet some students lack motivation to engage or persist in self-testing activities. adding game elements to a platform supporting self-testing may increase engagement and, by extension, exam performance. we conduct a randomized controlled experiment (n=701) comparing the effect of two game elements -- a points system and a badge system -- used individually and in combination. we find that the badge system elicits significantly higher levels of voluntary self-testing activity and this effect is particularly pronounced amongst a relatively small cohort. importantly, this increased activity translates to a significant improvement in exam scores. our data supports a causal relationship between gamification and learning outcomes, mediated by self-testing behavior. this provides empirical support for landers' theory of gamified learning when the gamified activity is conducted prior to measuring learning outcomes.",764.0,309.0,6468.0

"fingerping is a novel sensing technique that can recognize various fine-grained hand poses by analyzing acoustic resonance features. a surface-transducer mounted on a thumb ring injects acoustic chirps (20hz to 6,000hz) to the body. four receivers distributed on the wrist and thumb collect the chirps. different hand poses of the hand create distinct paths for the acoustic chirps to travel, creating unique frequency responses at the four receivers. we demonstrate how fingerping can differentiate up to 22 hand poses, including the thumb touching each of the 12 phalanges on the hand as well as 10 american sign language poses. a user study with 16 participants showed that our system can recognize these two sets of poses with an accuracy of 93.77% and 95.64%, respectively. we discuss the opportunities and remaining challenges for the widespread use of this input technique.","first, computational systems cannot classify content in as nuanced a way as human cognitive capabilities—which is why there are human moderators.13 for instance, people's definitions of “disturbing pictures” are likely to be different in varying degrees.","when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.",434.0,882.0,24634.0

"in recent years, the entity--component--system pattern has become a fundamental feature of the software architectures of game-development environments such as unity and unreal, which are used extensively in developing 3d user interfaces. in these systems, ui components typically respond to events, requiring programmers to write application-specific callback functions. in some cases, components are organized in a hierarchy that is used to propagate events among vertically connected components. when components need to communicate horizontally, programmers must connect those components manually and register/unregister events as needed. moreover, events and callback signatures may be incompatible, making modular uis cumbersome to build and share within or across applications. to address these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, mercury, to facilitate communication among components. we provide an overview of mercury, outline its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using relay nodes, describe a reference implementation in unity, and present example systems built using mercury to explain its advantages.","this type of awareness is critical in distributed teams where team members must inform one another of personal status, situation status, and actions.","in the physical world, teammates develop situation awareness about each other's location, status, and actions through cues such as gaze direction and ambient noise. to support situation awareness, distributed multiplayer games provide awareness cues - information that games automatically make available to players to support cooperative gameplay. the design of awareness cues can be extremely complex, impacting how players experience games and work with teammates. despite the importance of awareness cues, designers have little beyond experiential knowledge to guide their design. in this work, we describe a design framework for awareness cues, providing insight into what information they provide, how they communicate this information, and how design choices can impact play experience. our research, based on a grounded theory analysis of current games, is the first to provide a characterization of awareness cues, providing a palette for game designers to improve design practice and a starting point for deeper research into collaborative play.",585.0,241.0,8460.0
"people with health concerns go to online health support groups to obtain help and advice. to do so, they frequently disclose personal details, many times in public. although research in non-health settings suggests that people self-disclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. by automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale, we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. although one's self-disclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. these channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. we discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.","prior work has investigated the design of technology to support the wellbeing of students, focusing on topics such as social interaction during mealtimes, collaborative expressions of mood, improving sleep quality or enhancing stress management capabilities.","mental wellness is a desirable health outcome for students. however, current personal informatics systems do not adequately support students in creating concrete mental health-related goals and turning them into actionable plans. in this paper, we introduce mindnavigator - a workshop in which groups of college students were invited to generate behavioral change goals to manage daily life stress and practice personalized interventions for two weeks. we describe the manner in which participants identified both stressors and pleasures to create actionable, engaging, and open-ended behavioral plans that aided in stress relief. we found that the social nature of the workshop helped participants understand themselves and execute self-intervention in new ways. through this practice, we build on prior studies to propose an analytical framework of personal informatics for mental wellness.",695.0,569.0,13259.0

"pointing at remote objects to direct others' attention is a fundamental human ability. previous work explored methods for remote pointing to select targets. absolute pointing techniques that cast a ray from the user to a target are affected by humans' limited pointing accuracy. recent work suggests that accuracy can be improved by compensating systematic offsets between targets a user aims at and rays cast from the user to the target. in this paper, we investigate mid-air pointing in the real world and virtual reality. through a pointing study, we model the offsets to improve pointing accuracy and show that being in a virtual environment affects how users point at targets. in the second study, we validate the developed model and analyze the effect of compensating systematic offsets. we show that the provided model can significantly improve pointing accuracy when no cursor is provided. we further show that a cursor improves pointing accuracy but also increases the selection time.","therefore, a large body of work in the vr field has focused on conveying as much tangible information as possible from the real to the virtual world leading to more immersive experiences – for instance, rendering objects properties such as size, shape, texture, and weight.","humans can estimate the shape of a wielded object through the illusory feeling of the mass properties of the object obtained using their hands. even though the shape of hand-held objects influences immersion and realism in virtual reality (vr), it is difficult to design vr controllers for rendering desired shapes according to the perceptions derived from the illusory effects of mass properties and shape perception. we propose transcalibur, which is a hand-held vr controller that can render a 2d shape by changing its mass properties on a 2d planar area. we built a computational perception model using a data-driven approach from the collected data pairs of mass properties and perceived shapes. this enables transcalibur to easily and effectively provide convincing shape perception based on complex illusory effects. our user study showed that the system succeeded in providing the perception of various desired shapes in a virtual environment.",650.0,675.0,12856.0

"whereas social visual attention has been examined in computer-mediated (e.g., shared screen) or video-mediated (e.g., facetime) interaction, it has yet to be studied in mixed-media interfaces that combine video of the conversant along with other ui elements. we analyzed eye gaze of 37 dyads (74 participants) who were tasked with negotiating the price of a new car (as a buyer and seller) using mixed-media video conferencing under competitive or cooperative negotiation instructions (experimental manipulation). we used multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to extract spatio-temporal patterns corresponding to mutual gaze (individuals look at each other), joint attention (individuals focus on the same elements of the interface), and gaze aversion (an individual looks at their partner, who is looking elsewhere). our results indicated that joint attention predicted the sum of points attained by the buyer and seller (i.e., the joint score). in contrast, gaze aversion was associated with faster time to complete the negotiation, but with a lower joint score. unexpectedly, mutual gaze was highly infrequent and unrelated to the negotiation outcomes and none of the gaze patterns predicted subjective perceptions of the negotiation. there were also no effects of gender composition or negotiation condition on the gaze patterns or negotiation outcomes. our results suggest that social visual attention may operate differently in mixed-media collaborative interfaces than in face-to-face interaction. as mixed-media collaborative interfaces gain prominence, our work can be leveraged to inform the design of gaze-sensitive user interfaces that support remote negotiations among other tasks.","in response to this danger of being surreptitiously watched, users have been observed to block their webcam's view with stickers or sliding covers.","most of today's laptops come with an integrated webcam placed above the screen to enable video conferencing. due to the risk of webcam spying attacks, some laptop users seem to be concerned about their privacy and seek protection by covering the webcam. this paper is the first to investigate personal characteristics and beliefs of users with and without webcam covers by applying the theory of planned behavior. we record the privacy behavior of 180 users, develop a path model, and analyze it by applying partial least squares. the analysis indicates that privacy concerns do not significantly influence users' decision to use a webcam cover. rather, this behavior is influenced by users' attitudes, social environment, and perceived control over protecting privacy. developers should take this as a lesson to design privacy enhancing technologies which are convenient, verifiably effective and endorsed by peers.",1067.0,178.0,38222.0

"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.",a design intervention exploring conversational speech probes in the public spaces of low income communities in mumbai demonstrates opportunities for community learning through publicly accessible speech probes.,"millions of homes worldwide enjoy access to digital content and services through smart speakers such as amazon's echo and google's home. promotional materials and users' own videos typically show homes that have many well-resourced rooms, with good power and data infrastructures. over the last several years, we have been working with slum communities in india, whose dwellings are usually very compact (one or two rooms), personal home wifi is almost unheard of, power infrastructures are far less robust, and financial resources put such smart speakers out of individual household reach. inspired by the ""hole in the wall"" internet-kiosk programme, we carried out workshops with slum inhabitants to uncover issues and opportunities for providing a smart-speaker-type device in public areas and passageways. we designed and deployed a simple probe that allowed passers-by to ask and receive answers to questions. in this paper, we present the findings of this work, and a design space for such devices in these settings.",997.0,495.0,36587.0

"while online developer forums are major resources of knowledge for application developers, their roles in promoting better privacy practices remain underexplored. in this paper, we conducted a qualitative analysis of a sample of 207 threads (4772 unique posts) mentioning different forms of personal data from the /r/androiddev forum on reddit. we started with bottom-up open coding on the sampled posts to develop a typology of discussions about personal data use and conducted follow-up analyses to understand what types of posts elicited in-depth discussions on privacy issues or mentioned risky data practices. our results show that android developers rarely discussed privacy concerns when talking about a specific app design or implementation problem, but often had active discussions around privacy when stimulated by certain external events representing new privacy-enhancing restrictions from the android operating system, app store policies, or privacy laws. developers often felt these restrictions could cause considerable cost yet fail to generate any compelling benefit for themselves. given these results, we present a set of suggestions for android os and the app store to design more effective methods to enhance privacy, and for developer forums(e.g., /r/androiddev) to encourage more in-depth privacy discussions and nudge developers to think more about privacy.","found that after trying formal and informal methods to learn programming, including courses, tutorials, and forums, conversational programmers reported a lack of benefit and feelings of failure.","conversational programmers represent a class of learners who are not required to write any code, yet try to learn programming to improve their participation in technical conversations. we carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. however, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. our findings point to design opportunities in hci to invent learner-centered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.",1027.0,508.0,3209.0

"live streaming, which allows streamers to broadcast their work to live viewers, is an emerging practice for teaching and learning computer programming. participation in live streaming is growing rapidly, despite several apparent challenges, such as a general lack of training in pedagogy among streamers and scarce signals about a stream's characteristics (e.g., difficulty, style, and usefulness) to help viewers decide what to watch. to understand why people choose to participate in live streaming for teaching or learning programming, and how they cope with both apparent and non-obvious challenges, we interviewed 14 streamers and viewers about their experience with live streaming programming. among other results, we found that the casual and impromptu nature of live streaming makes it easier to prepare than pre-recorded videos, and viewers have the opportunity to shape the content and learning experience via real-time communication with both the streamer and each other. nonetheless, we identified several challenges that limit the potential of live streaming as a learning medium. for example, streamers voiced privacy and harassment concerns, and existing streaming platforms do not adequately support viewer-streamer interactions, adaptive learning, and discovery and selection of streaming content. based on these findings, we suggest specialized tools to facilitate knowledge sharing among people teaching and learning computer programming online, and we offer design recommendations that promote a healthy, safe, and engaging learning environment.","this is because idol culture has a unique characteristic, which is different from other situations that previous studies have examined, such as workplace communication and intimate relationships.","in romantic relationships, instant messaging (im) can serve as a communication channel to maintain a sense of mutual presence and relational closeness when being physically separated. however, im is asynchronous by design. there can exist time delay for people to receive and reply to incoming messages, which may violate romantic partner's mutual expectation. limited understanding is available around how unintended and intended delays affect the relationship of romantic partners. this work examines how romantic partners grow, perceive, and use mutual knowledge about each other in delayed im to resolve the expectancy violation. we conducted a 7-day diary study on 16 pairs of romantic couples and used the diary entries as probes for post-study one-on-one interviews. our findings show that couples employ different strategies of information grounding to parse and resolve delayed im. based on these findings, we propose several theoretical and practical implications.",1066.0,100.0,39648.0
"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.",[8] we first used a set of layout aesthetic quality metrics to compare notorus and torus using pairwise and all-pairs.,"we investigate visualisations of networks on a 2-dimensional torus topology, like an opened-up and flattened doughnut. that is, the network is drawn on a rectangular area while ""wrapping"" specific links around the border. previous work on torus drawings of networks has been mostly theoretical, limited to certain classes of networks, and not evaluated by human readability studies. we offer a simple interactive layout approach applicable to general graphs. we use this to find layouts affording better aesthetics in terms of conventional measures like more equal edge length and fewer crossings. in two controlled user studies we find that torus layout with either additional context or interactive panning provided significant performance improvement (in terms of error and time) over torus layout without either of these improvements, to the point that it is comparable to standard non-torus layout.",882.0,777.0,28338.0

"real-time crowdsourcing has made it possible to solve problems that are beyond the scope of artificial intelligence (ai) within a matter of seconds, rather than hours or days with traditional crowdsourcing techniques. while this has led to an increase in the potential application domains of crowdsourcing and human computation, problems that require machine-level speeds---on the order of milliseconds, not seconds---have remained out of reach because of the fundamental bounds of human perception and response time. in this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to exceed these bounds by combining human and machine intelligence. we introduce the look-ahead approach, a hybrid intelligence workflow that enables instantaneous crowdsourcing systems (i.e., those that can return crowd responses within mere milliseconds). the look-ahead approach works by exploring possible future states that may be encountered within a short time horizon (e.g., a few seconds into the future) and prefetching crowd worker responses to these states. we validate the efficacy and explore the limitations of our approach on the bolt system, which consists of an arcade-style game (lightning dodger) that we formally model as a markov decision process (mdp). when the mdp reward function is unspecified---as in many real-world tasks---the look-ahead approach enables just-in-time (jit) training of the agent's policy function. through a series of crowd worker experiments, we demonstrate that the look-ahead approach can outperform the fastest individual worker by approximately two orders of magnitude. our work opens new avenues for hybrid intelligence systems that are as smart as people, but also far faster than humanly possible.",researchers in the hci community have addressed the difficulties of discovering unique requirements that can occur when ai is applied to complex settings.,"calls for heightened consideration of fairness and accountability in algorithmically-informed public decisions-like taxation, justice, and child protection-are now commonplace. how might designers support such human values? we interviewed 27 public sector machine learning practitioners across 5 oecd countries regarding challenges understanding and imbuing public values into their work. the results suggest a disconnect between organisational and institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine learning-absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed. we see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed both at managers and at the 'street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of public service. we conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications.",464.0,437.0,9095.0

"older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. to date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. to do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security.","in live streaming, viewer interactions have facilitated engagement, the sense of community, and exchange of information.","despite gaining traction in north america, live streaming has not reached the popularity it has in china, where live- streaming has a tremendous impact on the social behaviors of users. to better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in china. we present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. we also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. we also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.",1062.0,463.0,6152.0

"through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.","another possible interpretation is, however, that these papers, while relating to sustainability, perhaps should not be classified as “sustainability papers.” a paper about supporting and scaling up sustainability-oriented organisations’ work should perhaps primarily be thought of in terms of being a paper about “activism” and “community organisations” (two of the paper's keywords) that only incidentally concerns community organisations that work towards sustainability-oriented change.","addressing calls in sustainable hci to scale up our work in hci targeting sustainability, and the current knowledge gap of how to do this practically, we here present a qualitative study of 10 sustainability-oriented community organizations that are working to scale up their change making. they are all loosely connected to a local transition network, meaning that they are aiming at transforming current practices in society, through local and practical action, to meet challenges related to climate change. we wanted to know how they try to scale up their change making, and what role ict plays in enabling scaling up. the study contributes new insights about three stages of scaling up, in which ict plays different roles. we conclude with implications for hci for how to support community organizations in scaling up, while keeping values important for working toward a more resilient society.",709.0,408.0,18075.0

"for individuals with mental illness, social media platforms are considered spaces for sharing and connection. however, not all expressions of mental illness are treated equally on these platforms. different aggregates of human and technical control are used to report and ban content, accounts, and communities. through two years of digital ethnography, including online observation and interviews, with people with eating disorders, we examine the experience of content moderation. we use a constructivist grounded theory approach to analysis that shows how practices of moderation across different platforms have particular consequences for members of marginalized groups, who are pressured to conform and compelled to resist. above all, we argue that platform moderation is enmeshed with wider processes of conformity to specific versions of mental illness. practices of moderation reassert certain bodies and experiences as 'normal' and valued, while rejecting others. at the same time, navigating and resisting these normative pressures further inscribes the marginal status of certain individuals. we discuss changes to the ways that platforms handle content related to eating disorders by drawing on the concept of multiplicity to inform design.","in particular, we leverage quantitative studies of social media that use network analysis to understand political polarization, qualitative analysis of comments to identify changes in online dialogue over time, and visualization research that reverse-engineers and classifies chart images.","this research examines how russian disinformation actors participated in a highly charged online conversation about the #blacklivesmatter movement and police-related shootings in the usa during 2016. we first present high-level dynamics of this conversation on twitter using a network graph based on retweet flows that reveals two structurally distinct communities. next, we identify accounts in this graph that were suspended by twitter for being affiliated with the internet research agency, an entity accused of conducting information operations in support of russian political interests. finally, we conduct an interpretive analysis that consolidates observations about the activities of these accounts. our findings have implications for platforms seeking to develop mechanisms for determining authenticity---by illuminating how disinformation actors enact authentic personas and caricatures to target different audiences. this work also sheds light on how these actors systematically manipulate politically active online communities by amplifying diverging streams of divisive content.",924.0,788.0,37365.0
"social media is often analyzed as a ""front stage"" where social media users perform their identities and manage impressions through various forms of user-generated content: text, picture, video, as well as visual expression such as emoticon, emoji, sticker, and meme. previous scholarship has suggested various functions of visual expression in supporting computer-mediated communication. in this study, we move beyond the utility perspective to ask what constitutes the literacy to utilize visual expression for impression management. towards this goal, we conducted an interview study with 30 social media users in china. we found that visual literacy intersects with its cultural context. our interviewees used text and visual expressions in sophisticated, skillful ways and tailored for different audiences in order to construct desired images. they also interacted with audience memory in order to perform their uniqueness and creativity. lastly, we discuss culturally-embedded visual literacy and provide implications for design.","whereas commercial platforms can be challenging to study, a growing body of work has studied volunteer moderation on reddit and twitch.","norms are central to how online communities are governed. yet, norms are also emergent, arise from interaction, and can vary significantly between communities---making them challenging to study at scale. in this paper, we study community norms on reddit in a large-scale, empirical manner. via 2.8m comments removed by moderators of 100 top subreddits over 10 months, we use both computational and qualitative methods to identify three types of norms: macro norms that are universal to most parts of reddit; meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms that are specific to individual, relatively unique subreddits. given the size of reddit's user base---and the wide range of topics covered by different subreddits---we argue this represents the first large-scale census of the norms in broader internet culture. in other words, these findings shed light on what reddit values, and how widely-held those values are. we conclude by discussing implications for the design of new and existing online communities.",888.0,800.0,20649.0

"in online communities, where billions of people strive to propagate their messages, understanding how wording affects success is of primary importance. in this work, we are interested in one particularly salient aspect of wording: brevity. what is the causal effect of brevity on message success? what are the linguistic traits of brevity? when is brevity beneficial, and when is it not? whereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success in observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd workers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd workers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. this allows us to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. we find that concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages up to a length reduction of 30--40%. the optimal reduction is on average between 10% and 20%. the observed effect is robust across different subpopulations of raters and is the strongest for raters who visit social media on a daily basis. finally, we discover unique linguistic and content traits of brevity and correlate them with the measured probability of success in order to distinguish effective from ineffective shortening strategies. overall, our findings are important for developing a better understanding of the effect of brevity on the success of messages in online social media.","a similar pattern has emerged with gender, where researchers are studying how makerspaces can be more inviting to women on the one hand [12,23], but also noting that women's engineering innovations have been cast as crafts and left out of dominant histories of technical innovation.","this paper describes the making core memory project, a design inquiry into the invisible work that went into assem-bling core memory, an early form of computer information storage initially woven by hand. drawing on feminist tradi-tions of situated knowing, we designed an electronic quilt and a series of participatory workshops that materialize the work of the core memory weavers. with this case we not only broaden dominant stories of design, but we also reflect on the entanglement of predominantly male, high status labor with the ostensibly low-status work of women's hands. by integrating design and archival research as a means of cultural analysis, we further expand conversations on design research methods within human-computer inter-action (hci), using design to reveal legacies of practice elided by contemporary technology cultures. in doing so, this paper highlights for hci scholars that worlds of hand-work and computing, or weaving and space travel, are not as separate as we might imagine them to be.",865.0,528.0,36446.0

"microfinance is an inherently social process. over the years, it has emerged as an essential means for providing financial services to the ""underbanked"" population in developing countries. this paper presents a qualitative study focused on understanding existing cooperative practices associated with microfinance in rural sri lanka. through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and visits to microfinance centres, we found that microfinancing involves much more than financial transactions, rather it is strongly habituated in the sociocultural fabric of communities. our findings show that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance. using examples from the field, this paper discusses the importance of these factors in microfinance activities and contributes an elaborated account of cooperative practices that support microfinance processes. we also highlight how the local sociocultural structures and practices shape the way microfinance processes are being handled. we contribute towards an in-depth understanding of such practices that can be useful for microfinance institutions (mfis) and technology designers. consequently, we advocate for an intermediary path for technology interventions where technology and people work together rather than technology replacing people.","the integration of physical and digital design platforms is a broad research area covering a variety of approaches (e.g., digital fabrication, automated, hybrid, and tangible approaches).","as design thinking shifted away from conventional methods with the rapid adoption of computer-aided design and fabrication technologies, architects have been seeking ways to initiate a comprehensive dialogue between the virtual and the material realms. current methodologies do not offer embodied workflows that utilize the feedback obtained through a subsequent transition process between physical and digital design. therefore, narrowing the separation between these two platforms remains as a research problem. this literature review elaborates the divide between physical and digital design, testing and manufacturing techniques in the morphological process of architectural form. we first review the digital transformation in the architectural design discourse. then, we proceed by introducing a variety of methods that are integrating digital and physical workflows and suggesting an alternative approach. our work unveils that there is a need for empirical research with a focus on integrated approaches to create intuitively embodied experiences for architectural designers.",832.0,724.0,22158.0

"the wide adoption of machine learning (ml) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ml models. some advocated the term ""machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ml models. this ""teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-ai interfaces. one promising learning paradigm is active learning (al), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. however, in current al settings, the human-ai interface remains minimal and opaque. a dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for al algorithms. in this work, we begin considering ai explanations as a core element of the human-ai interface for teaching machines. when a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. when a ml model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. when the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (xal), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable ai (xai) into an al setting. we conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with xal, to that of traditional al and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). our study shows benefits of ai explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to ai explanations, including task knowledge, ai experience and need for cognition. by reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for xal, and more broadly, machine teaching through ai explanations.","focusing on a particular, constrained part of the wide research field of note taking — as done in studies in specific contexts, from sketched information scraps all the way to bullet journaling — allows us to uncover nuances of people's rich practices in the analog that digital tools should not only support (bridging the analog/digital divide), but in fact advance beyond towards expressive digital tools.","digital self-tracking technologies offer many potential benefits over self-tracking with paper notebooks. however, they are often too rigid to support people's practical and emotional needs in everyday settings. to inform the design of more flexible self-tracking tools, we examine bullet journaling: an analogue and customisable approach for logging and reflecting on everyday life. analysing a corpus of paper bullet journal photos and related conversations on instagram, we found that individuals extended and adapted bullet journaling systems to their changing practical and emotional needs through: (1) creating and combining personally meaningful visualisations of different types of trackers, such as habit, mood, and symptom trackers; (2) engaging in mindful reflective thinking through design practices and self-reflective strategies; and (3) posting photos of paper journals online to become part of a self-tracking culture of sharing and learning. we outline two interrelated design directions for flexible and mindful self-tracking: digitally extending analogue self-tracking and supporting digital self-tracking as a mindful design practice.",1042.0,27.0,28398.0

"qualitative researchers perform an important and painstaking data annotation process known as coding. however, much of the process can be tedious and repetitive, becoming prohibitive for large datasets. could coding be partially automated, and should it be? to answer this question, we interviewed researchers and observed them code interview transcripts. we found that across disciplines, researchers follow several coding practices well-suited to automation. further, researchers desire automation after having developed a codebook and coded a subset of data, particularly in extending their coding to unseen data. researchers also require any assistive tool to be transparent about its recommendations. based on our findings, we built prototypes to partially automate coding using simple natural language processing techniques. our top-performing system generates coding that matches human coders on inter-rater reliability measures. we discuss implications for interface and algorithm design, meta-issues around automating qualitative research, and suggestions for future work.","these values were chosen based on previous findings in hand/finger-redirection, however after pilot testing, we set the start values in the staircase procedure to upper (1.0 - 1.8) and lower (1.0 - 0.5) using a 0.1 fixed step size as this leads to quicker convergence.","in this work, we utilize visuo-haptic illusions to improve the perceived performance of encountered-type haptic devices, specifically shape displays, in virtual reality. shape displays are matrices of actuated pins that travel vertically to render physical shapes; however, they have limitations such as low resolution, small display size, and low pin speed. to address these limitations, we employ illusions such as redirection, scaling, and retargeting that take advantage of the visual dominance effect, the idea that vision often dominates when senses conflict. our evaluation of these techniques suggests that redirecting sloped lines with angles less than 40 degrees onto a horizontal line is an effective technique for increasing the perceived resolution of the display. scaling up the virtual object onto the shape display by a factor less than 1.8x can also increase the perceived resolution. finally, using vertical redirection a perceived 3x speed increase can be achieved.",346.0,149.0,12892.0
"studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. this skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. for example, kay et al. showed that although 28% of ceos in the u.s. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for ""ceo"" in google image search are women. similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. these labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. however, such labels are often unknown. further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. as observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. we develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. the goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. it accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this ""diversity score"" into the final selection process. importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. we provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known mmr algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. we evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 google image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known celeba dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as ""smiling"" or ""glasses"". both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current google image search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. these empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search.","while prior work has also used crowdworkers to understand browser usage behavior, but focused only on how they managed crowdsourcing related tabs.","crowdworkers regularly support their work with scripts, extensions, and software to enhance their productivity. despite their evident significance, little is understood regarding how these tools affect crowdworkers' quality of life and work. in this study, we report findings from an interview study (n=21) aimed at exploring the tooling practices used by full-time crowdworkers on amazon mechanical turk. our interview data suggests that the tooling utilized by crowdworkers (1) strongly contributes to the fragmentation of microwork by enabling task switching and multitasking behavior; (2) promotes the fragmentation of crowdworkers' work-life boundaries by relying on tooling that encourages a 'work-anywhere' attitude; and (3) aids the fragmentation of social ties within worker communities through limited tooling access. our findings have implications for building systems that unify crowdworkers' work practice in support of their productivity and well-being.",1004.0,844.0,8730.0

"modern mobile apps aim to provide personalized services without appearing intrusive. a common strategy is to let the user initiate the service request (e.g., ""click here to receive coupons for your favorite products""), a practice known as ?overt personalization."" another strategy is to assuage users' privacy concerns by being transparent about how their data would be collected, utilized and stored. to test these two strategies, we conducted a 2 (personalization: overt vs. covert) x 2 (transparency: high vs. low) factorial experiment, with a fifth control condition. participants (n=302) interacted with greenbyme, a prototype of an eco-friendly mobile application. data show that overt personalization affects perceived control. significant three-way interactions between power usage, perceived overt personalization and perceived information transparency was seen on perceived ease of use, trust in the app, user engagement and behavioral intention to use the app in the future. in addition, results reveal that perceived information transparency also promotes trust, which is negatively linked with privacy concerns and positively correlated with user engagement and product involvement.","romanosky and chetty's engagements with both users and nonusers showed that while free basics shaped internet usage, participants were confused about the extent to which the arrangement was free.","companies are offering zero-rated, or data-charge free internet services to help bring unconnected users online where internet access is less affordable. however, it is unclear whether these services achieve this goal or how they shape internet use. to inform evidence-based policy around and the design of zero-rated services, we show in this paper how mobile users are making use of facebook's controversial free basics platform. we present findings from interviews of 35 free basics users in south africa: current low-income users and non-regular student users. our findings suggest that free basics does shape internet usage, for instance, users spend more time online because of 'free' apps. second, free basics saves users money but adoption of the platform depends on access to other 'free' internet options. finally, most users are confused about how zero-rated services work and what 'free' means. based on our findings, we make recommendations for future work.",534.0,190.0,36047.0
"crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective method of scaling-up tasks previously reserved for a small set of experts. accordingly, researchers in the large-scale online learning space have begun to employ crowdworkers to conduct research about large-scale, open online learning. we here report results from a crowdsourcing study (n=135) to evaluate the extent to which crowdworkers and mooc learners behave comparably on lecture viewing and quiz tasks---the most utilized learning activities in moocs. this serves to (i) validate the assumption of previous research that crowdworkers are indeed reliable proxies of online learners and (ii) address the potential of employing crowdworkers as a means of online learning environment testing. overall, we observe mixed results---in certain contexts (quiz performance and video watching behavior) crowdworkers appear to behave comparably to mooc learners, and in other situations (interactions with in-video quizzes), their behaviors appear to be disparate. we conclude that future research should be cautious if employing crowdworkers to carry out learning tasks, as the two populations do not behave comparably on all learning-related activities.","in recent years, live streaming has received increasing attention from the hci community.","despite gaining traction in north america, live streaming has not reached the popularity it has in china, where live- streaming has a tremendous impact on the social behaviors of users. to better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in china. we present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. we also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. we also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.",809.0,463.0,19720.0
"anonymization is viewed as a solution to over-exposure of personal information in a data-driven society. yet how organizations apply anonymization techniques to data for regulatory, ethical or commercial reasons remains underexplored. we investigate how such measures are applied in organizations, asking whether anonymization practices are used, what approaches are considered practical and adequate, and how decisions are made to protect the privacy of data subjects while preserving analytical value. our findings demonstrate that anonymization is applied to data far less pervasively than expected. organizations that do employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice is a complex socio-technical process that relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations. organizational decision-making about appropriate approaches and the management of responsibility can result in workarounds necessary to negotiate the technical complexity.","furthermore, this lends support to putze et al.’s findings that administering questionnaires in vr can reduce breaks in presence and avoid biases.","questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (vr) evaluations and user studies. however, transitioning from virtual worlds to the physical world to respond to vr experience questionnaires can potentially lead to systematic biases. administering questionnaires in vr (invrqs) is becoming more common in contemporary research. this is based on the intuitive notion that invrqs may ease participation, reduce the break in presence (bip) and avoid biases. in this paper, we perform a systematic investigation into the effects of interrupting the vr experience through questionnaires using physiological data as a continuous and objective measure of presence. in a user study (n=50), we evaluated question-asking procedures using a vr shooter with two different levels of immersion. the users rated their player experience with a questionnaire either inside or outside of vr. our results indicate a reduced bip for the employed invrq without affecting the self-reported player experience.",833.0,741.0,30871.0

"as humans, we have the natural capability of localizing the origin of sounds. spatial audio rendering leverages this skill by applying special filters to recorded audio to create the impression that a sound emanates from a certain position in the physical space. a main application for spatial audio on mobile devices is to provide non-visual navigation cues. current systems require users to either listen to artificial beacon sounds, or the entire audio source (e.g., a song) is repositioned in space, which impacts the listening experience. we present navigatone, a system that takes advantage of multi-track recordings and provides directional cues by moving a single track in the auditory space. while minimizing the impact of the navigation component on the listening experience, a user study showed that participants could localize sources as good as with stereo panning while the listening experience was rated to be closer to common music listening.","[19] developed an ensemble method to improve the quality of video segmentation, and song et al.","in this work, we propose two ensemble methods leveraging a crowd workforce to improve video annotation, with a focus on video object segmentation. their shared principle is that while individual candidate results may likely be insufficient, they often complement each other so that they can be combined into something better than any of the individual results---the very spirit of collaborative working. for one, we extend a standard polygon-drawing interface to allow workers to annotate negative space, and combine the work of multiple workers instead of relying on a single best one as commonly done in crowdsourced image segmentation. for the other, we present a method to combine multiple automatic propagation algorithms with the help of the crowd. such combination requires an understanding of where the algorithms fail, which we gather using a novel coarse scribble video annotation task. we evaluate our ensemble methods, discuss our design choices for them, and make our web-based crowdsourcing tools and results publicly available.",634.0,110.0,4102.0

"esports commentating, the practice of reporting, explaining, and elaborating live competitive gameplay to spectators, is a centerpiece of esports as a rapidly growing spectator sport and an essential component of today's growing gaming/live streaming ecosystem. in particular, esports commentators face three unique challenges: the preparation for conducting real time commentating on highly dynamic esports games; the complexity of in-the-moment decisions during the game's broadcast; and the balance between personal self-presentation and professional content presentation. yet this emerging and novel sociotechnical practice and how these challenges affect esports commentators' live performance and self-presentation practices has received relatively little research attention in hci and cscw. in this paper, we endeavor to address these limitations by empirically analyzing 19 esports commentators' sociotechnical practices. our findings highlight the complex interaction dynamics involved in esports commentating as well as the importance of professionalism and social presence in esports commentators' self-presentation. in order to execute seamless and spontaneous commentary, commentators must be studious and engage in much prior research and have a clear sense of self. we contribute to the growing cscw literature on esports commentating practices by revealing esports commentators' unique decision making process presenting information and their self-image.","therefore, a large body of work in the vr field has focused on conveying as much tangible information as possible from the real to the virtual world leading to more immersive experiences – for instance, rendering objects properties such as size, shape, texture, and weight.","we present haptic revolver, a handheld virtual reality controller that renders fingertip haptics when interacting with virtual surfaces. haptic revolver's core haptic element is an actuated wheel that raises and lowers underneath the finger to render contact with a virtual surface. as the user's finger moves along the surface of an object, the controller spins the wheel to render shear forces and motion under the fingertip. the wheel is interchangeable and can contain physical textures, shapes, edges, or active elements to provide different sensations to the user. because the controller is spatially tracked, these physical features can be spatially registered with the geometry of the virtual environment and rendered on-demand. we evaluated haptic revolver in two studies to understand how wheel speed and direction impact perceived realism. we also report qualitative feedback from users who explored three application scenarios with our controller.",968.0,85.0,12856.0

"online fraud is the well-known dark side of the modern internet. unsupervised fraud detection algorithms are widely used to address this problem. however, selecting features, adjusting hyperparameters, evaluating the algorithms, and eliminating false positives all require human expert involvement. in this work, we design and implement an end-to-end interactive visualization system, fdhelper, based on the deep understanding of the mechanism of the black market and fraud detection algorithms. we identify a workflow based on experience from both fraud detection algorithm experts and domain experts. using a multi-granularity three-layer visualization map embedding an entropy-based distance metric coldis, analysts can interactively select different feature sets, refine fraud detection algorithms, tune parameters and evaluate the detection result in near real-time. we demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of fdhelper through two case studies with state-of-the-art fraud detection algorithms, interviews with domain experts and algorithm experts, and a user study with eight first-time end users.",one result of this limited focus is the lack of standardized widgets to express a wide range of shape-change features: most of these systems present at most one or two reusable transforming shapes and can express a fraction of the morphees+ feature space.,"users interact with many reconfigurable objects in daily life. these objects embed reconfigurations and shape- changing features that users are familiar with. for this reason, everyday reconfigurable objects have informed the design and taxonomy of shape changing ui. however, they have never been explored systematically. in this paper, we present a data set of 82 everyday reconfigurable objects that we collected in a workshop. we discuss how they can inspire the design of reconfigurable interfaces. we particularly focus on taxonomies of reconfigurable interfaces. taxonomies have been suggested to help design and communication among researchers, however despite their extensive use, taxonomies are rarely evaluated. this paper analyses two established taxonomies - rasmussen's and roudaut's - using daily reconfigurable objects. we show relationships between the taxonomies and area for improvements. we propose morphees+, a refined taxonomy based on roudaut's shape resolution taxonomy.",737.0,616.0,5815.0
"the effects of facebook on academic performance have attracted both public and scholarly attention. prior research found that facebook use is linked to poor academic performance, suggesting that facebook distracts students from studying. these studies, which are primarily based on survey responses, are insufficient to uncover exactly how facebook is used or embedded in students' studying activities. to capture unbiased, detailed use patterns and to investigate the context of facebook use, we studied 50 college students using automatic logging and experience sampling. we analyzed the activities and attentional states of students prior to visiting facebook. results show that gpas of frequent facebook users do not suffer. students with high gpas spend shorter time in each facebook session and shorter facebook use often follows schoolwork. these results point to a possibility that potentially problematic facebook use occurs when students are in a spree of leisure activities, not while studying.","however, the verification of online sources is full of challenges, including constantly changing environments, lack of action and cooperation with data owners, and lack of reliable reach data.","journalists are increasingly investigating and reporting on problematic online content such as misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories, leading to the creation of a new misinformation beat. the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on this kind of data is complex and nuanced. it is especially challenging as online actors attempt to undermine their work. through in-depth interviews with twelve journalists, we explore how they investigate and report on online misinformation and disinformation. our findings reveal some of the unique challenges of reporting on this beat, as well as the ways in which reporters overcome those challenges. we highlight and discuss how journalistic values could be better embedded into the design of tools to support their work, the power dynamics between social media companies and journalists, and the promise of collaborations as a way to support and educate journalists on this beat. this work provides contextual knowledge to researchers looking to better support investigative journalists - on the misinformation beat and beyond - as their work becomes more entangled in sociotechnical systems.",415.0,998.0,27123.0
management of technological change in organizations is one of the most enduring topics in the literature on computer-supported cooperative work. the successful navigation of technological change is both more challenging and more critical in online communities that are entirely mediated by technology than it is in traditional organizations. this paper presents an analysis of 14 in-depth interviews with moderators of subcommunities of one technological platform (reddit) that added communities on a new technological platform (discord). moderation teams experienced several problems related to moderating content at scale as well as a disconnect between the affordances of discord and their assumptions based on their experiences on reddit. we found that moderation teams used discord's api to create scripts and bots that augmented discord to make the platform work more like tools on reddit. these tools were particularly important in communities struggling with scale. our findings suggest that increasingly widespread end user programming allow users of social computing systems to innovate and deploy solutions to unanticipated design problems by transforming new technological platforms to align with their past expectations.,"examples include pledgework, a system for volunteers to donate their income from crowd work to a third party (a charity), revenue sharing (e.g.,), and the review of subcontracting microwork by morris et al.","paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.",864.0,997.0,35055.0

"real-time crowdsourcing has made it possible to solve problems that are beyond the scope of artificial intelligence (ai) within a matter of seconds, rather than hours or days with traditional crowdsourcing techniques. while this has led to an increase in the potential application domains of crowdsourcing and human computation, problems that require machine-level speeds---on the order of milliseconds, not seconds---have remained out of reach because of the fundamental bounds of human perception and response time. in this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to exceed these bounds by combining human and machine intelligence. we introduce the look-ahead approach, a hybrid intelligence workflow that enables instantaneous crowdsourcing systems (i.e., those that can return crowd responses within mere milliseconds). the look-ahead approach works by exploring possible future states that may be encountered within a short time horizon (e.g., a few seconds into the future) and prefetching crowd worker responses to these states. we validate the efficacy and explore the limitations of our approach on the bolt system, which consists of an arcade-style game (lightning dodger) that we formally model as a markov decision process (mdp). when the mdp reward function is unspecified---as in many real-world tasks---the look-ahead approach enables just-in-time (jit) training of the agent's policy function. through a series of crowd worker experiments, we demonstrate that the look-ahead approach can outperform the fastest individual worker by approximately two orders of magnitude. our work opens new avenues for hybrid intelligence systems that are as smart as people, but also far faster than humanly possible.","upon heating, this stress is released in the form of a pre-determined shape change.","we develop a novel method printing complex self-folding geometries. we demonstrated that with a desktop fused deposition modeling (fdm) 3d printer, off-the-shelf printing filaments and a design editor, we can print flat thermoplastic composites and trigger them to self-fold into 3d with arbitrary bending angles. this is a suitable technique, called thermorph, to prototype hollow and foldable 3d shapes without losing key features. we describe a new curved folding origami design algorithm, compiling given arbitrary 3d models to 2d unfolded models in g-code for fdm printers. to demonstrate the thermorph platform, we designed and printed complex self-folding geometries (up to 70 faces), including 15 self-curved geometric primitives and 4 self-curved applications, such as chairs, the simplified stanford bunny and flowers. compared to the standard 3d printing, our method saves up to 60% - 87% of the printing time for all shapes chosen.",464.0,258.0,26004.0

"developing interactive systems often involves a large set of callback functions for handling user interaction, which makes it challenging to manage ui behaviors, create descriptive documentation, and track code revisions. we developed doppio, a tool that automatically tracks and visualizes ui flows and their changes based on source code. for each input event listener of a widget, e.g., onclick of an android view class, doppio captures and associates its ui output from a program execution with its code snippet from the codebase. it automatically generates a screenflow diagram organized by the callback methods and interaction flow, where developers can review the code and ui revisions interactively. doppio, as an ide plugin, is seamlessly integrated into a common development workflow. our studies show that our tool is able to generate quality visual documentation and helped participants understand unfamiliar source code and track changes.","smith and nayar developed the rad, an auditory display for gamers with visual impairments aiming for equal accessibility in racing games.","we introduce the racing auditory display (rad), an audio-based user interface that allows players who are blind to play the same types of racing games that sighted players can play with an efficiency and sense of control that are similar to what sighted players have. the rad works with a standard pair of headphones and comprises two novel sonification techniques: the sound slider for understanding a car's speed and trajectory on a racetrack and the turn indicator system for alerting players of the direction, sharpness, length, and timing of upcoming turns. in a user study with 15 participants (3 blind; the rest blindfolded and analyzed separately), we found that players preferred the rad's interface over that of mach 1, a popular blind-accessible racing game. we also found that the rad allows an avid gamer who is blind to race as well on a complex racetrack as casual sighted players can, without a significant difference between lap times or driving paths.",452.0,513.0,6569.0

"augmented reality (ar) applications are growing in popularity in educational settings. while the effects of ar experiences on learning have been widely studied, there is relatively less research on understanding the impact of ar on the dynamics of co-located collaborative learning, specifically in the context of novices programming robots. educational robotics are a powerful learning context because they engage students with problem solving, critical thinking, stem (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) concepts, and collaboration skills. however, such collaborations can suffer due to students having unequal access to resources or dominant peers. in this research we investigate how augmented reality impacts learning and collaboration while peers engage in robot programming activities. we use a mixed methods approach to measure how participants are learning, manipulating resources, and engaging in problem solving activities with peers. we investigate how these behaviors are impacted by the presence of augmented reality visualizations, and by participants? proximity to resources. we find that augmented reality improved overall group learning and collaboration. detailed analysis shows that ar strongly helps one participant more than the other, by improving their ability to learn and contribute while remaining engaged with the robot. furthermore, augmented reality helps both participants maintain a common ground and balance contributions during problem solving activities. we discuss the implications of these results for designing ar and non-ar collaborative interfaces.",pierce's concepts around social acceptability could prove useful for considering these implications and ought to be taken a step further to consider intra-household relations.,"through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.",1052.0,709.0,24988.0

"venous materials is a novel concept and approach of an interactive material utilizing fluidic channels. we present a design method for fluidic mechanisms that respond to deformation by mechanical inputs from the user, such as pressure and bending. we designed a set of primitive venous structures that act as embedded analog fluidic sensors, displaying flow and color change. in this paper, we consider the fluid as the medium to drive tangible information triggered by deformation, and at the same time, to function as a responsive display of that information. to provide users with a simple way to create and validate designs of fluidic structures, we built a software platform and design tool ui. this design tool allows users to quickly design the geometry, and simulate the flow with intended mechanical force dynamically. we present a range of applications that demonstrate how venous materials can be utilized to augment interactivity of everyday physical objects.","considering that the salient areas play a major role in the selection of the locations that the gestures are drawn, that the complexity of an image is defined by the number of the salient areas, and that image complexity influences users towards password creation, we decided to use images of three different complexity levels (low, medium, and high), aiming to have a broader set of images that are selected as background images to draw graphical passwords.","visual attention, search, processing and comprehension are important cognitive tasks during a graphical password composition activity. aiming to shed light on whether individual differences on visual behavior affect the strength of the created passwords, we conducted an eye-tracking study (n=36), and adopted an accredited cognitive style theory to interpret the results. the analysis revealed that users with different cognitive styles followed different patterns of visual behavior which affected the strength of the created passwords. motivated, by the results of the first study, we introduced adaptive characteristics to the user authentication mechanism, aiming to assist specific cognitive style user groups to create more secure passwords, and conducted a second study with a new sample (n=40) to test the adaptive characteristics. results strengthen our assumptions that adaptive mechanisms based on users' differences in cognitive and visual behavior uncover a new perspective for improving the password's strength within graphical user authentication realms.",726.0,86.0,6434.0
"live streaming services allow people to concurrently consume and comment on media events with other people in real time. durkheim's theory of ""collective effervescence"" suggests that face-to-face encounters in ritual events conjure emotional arousal, so people often feel happier and more excited while watching events like the super bowl with family and friends through the television than if they were alone. does a stronger emotional intensity also occur in live streaming? using a large-scale dataset of comments posted to news and media events on youtube, we address this question by examining emotional intensity in live comments versus those produced retrospectively. results reveal that live comments are overall more emotionally intense than retrospective comments across all temporal periods and all event types examined. findings support the emotional amplification hypothesis and provide preliminary evidence for shared attention theory in explaining the amplification effect. these findings have important implications for live streaming platforms to optimize resources for content moderation and to improve psychological well-being for content moderators, and more broadly as society grapples with using technology to stay connected during social distancing required by the covid-19 pandemic.","based on prior literature, we include support for contextualization of scraps through enabling context notes that users can associate with a scrap and automatically inferring context (e.g., location, nearby landmarks).","as highlighted in recent work on remix in online content creation communities, people commonly take and appropriate digital content for new activities. less is known, however, about how people repurpose digital content as part of work. we report findings from an interview study with 19 individuals in which we explored how digital content in the workplace becomes a material for remix. our analysis emphasizes (i) how digital content is obtained from colleagues for remix, (ii) how content is made available for remix by others, and (iii) how digital content is transformed for remix. in attending to these broader processes of remix, we consider the roles of workplace technologies, such as those for file sharing, as well as social norms that mediate access, remix, and acknowledgement. we draw implications for design of technology that emphasize support for individuals in making digital content available for remix, and raising awareness of the context of that content.",931.0,594.0,39350.0
"public benefits programs help people afford necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. in the us, such programs are means-tested: applicants must complete long forms to prove financial distress before receiving aid. online benefits screening tools provide a gloss of such forms, advising households about their eligibility prior to completing full applications. if incorrectly implemented, screening tools may discourage qualified households from applying for benefits. unfortunately, errors in screening tools are difficult to detect because they surface one at a time and difficult to contest because unofficial determinations do not generate a paper trail. we introduce a method for auditing such tools in four steps: 1) generate test households, 2) automatically populate screening questions with household information and retrieve determinations, 3) translate eligibility guidelines into computer code to generate ground truth determinations, and 4) identify conflicting determinations to detect errors. we illustrated our method on a real screening tool with households modeled from census data. our method exposed major errors with corresponding examples to reproduce them. our work provides a necessary corrective to an already arduous benefits application process.","we believe this is of special interest for devices that natively offer motion tracking or finger tracking, such as for virtual reality (which we illustrated in figure 1 using the oculus quest), smartwatch-based interaction or even leveraging a smartphone's built in imus.","smartwatches are always-available, provide quick access to information in a mobile setting, and can collect continuous health and fitness data. however, the small interaction space of these wearables may pose challenges for people with upper body motor impairments. to investigate accessible smartwatch interactions for this user group, we conducted two studies. first, we assessed the accessibility of existing smartwatch gestures with 10 participants with motor impairments. we found that not all participants were able to complete button, swipe and tap interactions. in a second study, we adopted a participatory approach to explore smartwatch gesture preferences and to gain insight into alternative, more accessible smartwatch interaction techniques. eleven participants with motor impairments created gestures for 16 common smartwatch actions on both touchscreen and non-touchscreen (bezel, wristband) areas of the watch and the user's body. we present results from both studies and provide design recommendations.",948.0,485.0,283.0
"job burnout is a special type of work-related stress that is prevalent in our modern society, and constant burnout is extremely harmful for people's physical health and emotional wellbeing. traditional studies for burnout mainly rely on surveys/questionnaires, which have revealed several interesting findings but are of high cost and very time consuming. with the prevalence of social networking applications, we aim to re-investigate the burnout phenomenon in a novel perspective. in this paper, we collected a dataset consisting of 1532 burnout weibo users with their postings. based on the previous literature, we propose a number of hypotheses about what might be the burst signal of the burnout from the perspective of language, time and interaction. furthermore, extensive correlation analysis is conducted to investigate if these hypotheses are supported, which leads to a number of interesting findings. finally, we develop machine learning models to predict the burst of burnout based on extracted features and achieve a relatively high accuracy, which reveals potential implications in early-stage intervention.","while previous works (e.g.,) limit the analyses on the first received comment and the corresponding seekers’ reply to avoid the complexity of the thread structure, we do not restrict the position of the comment and reply since we are interested in studying seekers’ satisfaction with each comment.","people with health concerns go to online health support groups to obtain help and advice. to do so, they frequently disclose personal details, many times in public. although research in non-health settings suggests that people self-disclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. by automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale, we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. although one's self-disclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. these channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. we discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.",1072.0,695.0,32453.0
"indoor localization technologies can enhance quality of life for blind people by enabling them to independently explore and navigate indoor environments. researchers typically evaluate their systems in terms of localization accuracy and user behavior along planned routes. we propose two measures of path-following behavior: deviation from optimal route and trajectory variability. through regression analysis of real-world trajectories from blind users, we identify relationships between a) these measures and b) elements of the environment, route characteristics, localization error, and instructional cues that users receive. our results provide insights into path-following behavior for turn-by-turn indoor navigation and have implications for the design of future interactions. moreover, our findings highlight the importance of reporting these environmental factors and route properties in similar studies. we present automated and scalable methods for their calculation and to encourage their reporting for better interpretation and comparison of results across future studies.","furthermore, augmenting 3d printed objects with rich material properties have been introduced.","in our everyday life, we interact with and benefit from objects with a wide range of material properties. in contrast, personal fabrication machines (e.g., desktop 3d printers) currently only support a much smaller set of materials. our goal is to close the gap between current limitations and the future of multi-material printing by enabling people to explore the reuse of material from everyday objects into their custom designs. to achieve this, we develop a library of embeddables--everyday objects that can be cut, worked and embedded into 3d printable designs. we describe a design space that characterizes the geometric and material properties of embeddables. we then develop medley---a design tool whereby users can import a 3d model, search for embeddables with desired material properties, and interactively edit and integrate their geometry to fit into the original design. medley also supports the final fabrication and embedding process, including instructions for carving or cutting the objects, and generating optimal paths for inserting embeddables. to validate the expressiveness of our library, we showcase numerous examples augmented by embeddables that go beyond the objects' original printed materials.",55.0,161.0,26184.0

"creating new 3d printed objects by recombining models found in hobbyist repositories has been referred to as ""re-mixing"". in this paper, we explore how to best support users in remixing a specific class of 3d printed objects, namely those that perform mechanical functions. in our survey, we found that makers remix such machines by manually extracting parts from one parent model and combine it with parts from a different parent model. this approach often puts axles made by one maker into bearings made by another maker or combines a gear by one maker with a gear by a different maker. this approach is problem-atic, however, as parts from different makers tend to fit poorly, which results in long series of tweaks and test-prints until all parts finally work together. we address this with our interactive system grafter. grafter does two things. first, grafter largely automates the process of extracting and recombining mechanical elements from 3d printed machines. second, it enforces a more efficient approach to reuse: it prevents users from extracting indi-vidual parts, but instead affords extracting groups of me-chanical elements that already work together, such as axles and their bearings or pairs of gears. we call this mecha-nism-based remixing. in a final user study, all models that participants had remixed using grafter could be 3d printed without further tweaking and worked immediately.","for example, a typical notebook tends to be long and filled with interim notes and findings that may not contribute to the communication of the higher-level ideas and insights of the author.","computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. we present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. in the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on github, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. in a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. in a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. these studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. we conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.",62.0,31.0,44480.0

"in chronic conditions, patients and providers need support in understanding and managing illness over time. focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. we found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and providers; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. we note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues.",research on text entry with physical keyboards in vr has shown that visual feedback of the hands is important for typing accuracy and efficiency.,"entering text is one of the most common tasks when interacting with computing systems. virtual reality (vr) presents a challenge as neither the user's hands nor the physical input devices are directly visible. hence, conventional desktop peripherals are very slow, imprecise, and cumbersome. we developed a apparatus that tracks the user's hands, and a physical keyboard, and visualize them in vr. in a text input study with 32 participants, we investigated the achievable text entry speed and the effect of hand representations and transparency on typing performance, workload, and presence. with our apparatus, experienced typists benefited from seeing their hands, and reach almost outside-vr performance. inexperienced typists profited from semi-transparent hands, which enabled them to type just 5.6 wpm slower than with a regular desktop setup. we conclude that optimizing the visualization of hands in vr is important, especially for inexperienced typists, to enable a high typing performance.",1068.0,343.0,7354.0
"time-based events, such as hackathons and codefests, have become a global phenomenon attracting thousands of participants to hundreds of events every year. while research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. while case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. while short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation.","in terms of assembling a 3d printed adaptation to an existing object, previous works have used extra soft materials to tolerate size mismatch and applied glue or zip tie to reassure a firm bonding.","in our everyday life, we interact with and benefit from objects with a wide range of material properties. in contrast, personal fabrication machines (e.g., desktop 3d printers) currently only support a much smaller set of materials. our goal is to close the gap between current limitations and the future of multi-material printing by enabling people to explore the reuse of material from everyday objects into their custom designs. to achieve this, we develop a library of embeddables--everyday objects that can be cut, worked and embedded into 3d printable designs. we describe a design space that characterizes the geometric and material properties of embeddables. we then develop medley---a design tool whereby users can import a 3d model, search for embeddables with desired material properties, and interactively edit and integrate their geometry to fit into the original design. medley also supports the final fabrication and embedding process, including instructions for carving or cutting the objects, and generating optimal paths for inserting embeddables. to validate the expressiveness of our library, we showcase numerous examples augmented by embeddables that go beyond the objects' original printed materials.",1010.0,161.0,26196.0

"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.","in terms of social relationships under remote collaboration, research has been done to investigate remote team viability.","understanding team viability --- a team's capacity for sustained and future success --- is essential for building effective teams. in this study, we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to train a viability classification model over a dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams. we train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. we find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 auc roc under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. from these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as 'but' and 'except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction. this work suggests opportunities for teams to assess, track, and visualize their own viability in real time as they collaborate.",882.0,1037.0,21206.0

"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.","this not only allows people to perform mobile crowdsourcing tasks nearly anywhere and at any time, but also allows entities seeking specific types of crowdsourced information to prompt mobile users to contribute them.","we consider the challenge of motivating and coordinating large numbers of people to contribute to solving local, communal problems through their existing routines. in order to design such ""on-the-go crowdsourcing"" systems, there is a need for mechanisms that can effectively coordinate contributions to address problem solving needs in the physical world while leveraging people's existing mobility with minimal disruption. we thus introduce hit-or-wait, a general decision-theoretic mechanism that intelligently controls decisions over when to notify a person of a task, in ways that reason both about system needs across tasks and about a helper's changing patterns of mobility. through simulations and a field study in the context of community-based lost-and-found, we demonstrate that using hit-or-wait enables a system to make efficient use of people's contributions with minimal disruptions to their routines without the need for explicit coordination. interviews with field study participants further suggest that highlighting an individual's contribution to the global goal may help people value their contributions more.",882.0,95.0,39814.0

"despite high levels of digital technology access among college students, technology disruption remains an issue. this study was conducted to understand how technology disruption might contribute to socio-economic disparities in academic performance. data were analyzed from a non-representative sample of 748 undergraduate students. we examined socio-economic differences in types of technology problems students experience; the consequences of those problems; and beliefs about how to handle future problems. socio-economic status was not associated with types of technology problems, but it was associated with greater negative consequences and less-efficacious beliefs about handling future situations. these findings are consistent with sociological work on socio-economic differences in student help-seeking. they also elaborate mechanistic understanding of the technology maintenance construct. finally, for those interested in designing to reduce socio-economic inequalities, they suggest the need for interfaces that go beyond information accessibility to facilitate student empowerment and student-teacher communication.","in this paper we examined parent-tween experiences in the context of tweens’ naturecollections app use by analyzing: (1) parent self-reported descriptions of their experiences during exit interviews, and (2) tweens’ and their families’ real-time interactions when using the app, recorded using the anchored audio sampling method (aas)[22].","many traditional hci methods, such as surveys and interviews, are of limited value when working with preschoolers. in this paper, we present anchored audio sampling (aas), a remote data collection technique for extracting qualitative audio samples during field deployments with young children. aas offers a developmentally sensitive way of understanding how children make sense of technology and situates their use in the larger context of daily life. aas is defined by an anchor event, around which audio is collected. a sliding window surrounding this anchor captures both antecedent and ensuing recording, providing the researcher insight into the activities that led up to the event of interest as well as those that followed. we present themes from three deployments that leverage this technique. based on our experiences using aas, we have also developed a reusable open-source library for embedding aas into any android application.",753.0,672.0,28867.0
"digital self-improvement programs (e.g., interventions, training programs, self-help apps) are widely accessible, but can not employ the same degree of external regulation as programs delivered in controlled environments. as a result, they suffer from high attrition -- even the best programs won't work if people don't use them. we propose that volitional engagement -- facilitated through avatar customization -- can help combat attrition. we asked 250 participants to engage daily for 3 weeks in a one-minute breathing exercise for anxiety reduction, using either a generic avatar or one that they customized. customizing an avatar resulted in significantly less attrition and more sustained engagement as measured through login counts. the problem of attrition affects self-improvement programs across a range of do-mains; we provide a subtle, versatile, and broadly-applicable solution.","other work, like dynamic brushes, aims to support expressiveness through a direct manipulation environment coupled with a programming language.","procedural art, or art made with programming, suggests opportunities to extend traditional arts like painting and drawing; however, this potential is limited by tools that conflict with manual practices. programming languages present learning barriers and manual drawing input is not a first class primitive in common programming models. we hypothesize that by developing programming languages and environments that align with how manual artists work, we can build procedural systems that enhance, rather than displace, manual art. to explore this, we developed dynamic brushes, a programming and drawing environment motivated by interviews with artists. dynamic brushes enables the creation of ad-hoc drawing tools that transform stylus inputs to procedural patterns. applications range from transforming individual strokes to behaviors that draw multiple strokes simultaneously, respond to temporal events, and leverage external data. results from an extended evaluation with artists provide guidelines for learnable, expressive systems that blend manual and procedural creation.",657.0,587.0,18779.0
