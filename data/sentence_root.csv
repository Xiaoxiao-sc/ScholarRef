"needle-guiding templates are used for a variety of minimally invasive medical interventions. while physically supporting needle placement with a grid of holes, they lack integrated information where needles need to be inserted. physicians must manually determine the correct holes based on the output of planning software - a workflow that is error-prone and lengthy. we address these issues by embedding a display into the template using electroluminescence (el) screen printing. the el display is connected to planning software and illuminates the correct hole. in an empirical evaluation with physicians and researchers from the medical domain, we compare the illuminated against the conventional template as used in magnetic resonance imaging (mri) guided prostate biopsies. our results show that the el display significantly improves task completion time by 51%, task load by 47% and usability by 30%.","they can engage with multiple people at the same time in intimate home settings, often in the form of an agent.","voice user interfaces (vuis) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via 'assistant' devices. yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. by collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the amazon echo in participants' homes-informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis-our study documents the methodical practices of vui users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. we discuss how the vui is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. finally, we locate implications for the accountability of vui interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing 'conversational' interfaces.",261.0,637.0,17890.0
"online instructional videos are ubiquitous, but it is difficult for instructors to gauge learners' experience and their level of comprehension or confusion regarding the lecture video. moreover, learners watching the videos may become disengaged or fail to reflect and construct their own understanding. this paper explores instructor and learner perceptions of in-video prompting where learners answer reflective questions while watching videos. we conducted two studies with crowd workers to understand the effect of prompting in general, and the effect of different prompting strategies on both learners and instructors. results show that some learners found prompts to be useful checkpoints for reflection, while others found them distracting. instructors reported the collected responses to be generally more specific than what they have usually collected. also, different prompting strategies had different effects on the learning experience and the usefulness of responses as feedback.","how to communicate such connected social cues is also important, as researchers found that different visualizations of eye gaze information affect task collaboration.","in remote collaboration, gaze visualizations are designed to display where collaborators are looking in a shared visual space. this type of gaze-based intervention can improve coordination, however researchers have yet to fully explore different gaze visualization techniques and develop a deeper understanding of the ways in which features of visualizations may interact with task attributes to influence collaborative performance. there are many ways to visualize characteristics of eye movements, such as a path connecting fixation points or a heat map illustrating fixation duration and coverage. in this study, we designed and evaluated three unique gaze visualizations in a remote search task. our results suggest that the design of gaze visualizations affects performance, coordination, searching behavior, and perceived utility. additionally, the degree of task coupling further influences the effect of gaze visualizations on performance and coordination. we then reflect on the value of gaze visualizations for remote work and discuss implications for the design of gaze-based interventions.",317.0,347.0,26342.0

"this study explores whether a life metaphoric game can effectively facilitate communication between senior participants and young adult partners during a life review activity. life review provides older adults with opportunities to organize their past experiences, rediscover the meaning of life, and prepare for their future life and eventual death. we held workshops in which 33 senior participants (ages 51-85) co-played a commercial game, titled ""long journey of life,"" paired with young adult partners (ages 19-23). the young partners asked senior participants about their associated memories during the life review activity. through inductive thematic analysis, we found seven communication themes during the life review activity: reminiscence, future and death preparation, life advice, appreciation and evaluation, small talks involving self-disclosure, interpretation of metaphors, and explanation of game control methods. we investigated the relationships between communication themes and game design elements that promote conversation. in addition, we identified how participants' responses to the game differ depending on the player's characteristics and generation. game design suggestions for an effective intergenerational life review using digital games were offered.","however, designers should be aware that such technological interventions could potentially bring additional labor to the support-seekers and frustrate support-seekers who are sensitive of being judged in omhcs, and members should have the option to enable / disable such interventions.","people with health concerns go to online health support groups to obtain help and advice. to do so, they frequently disclose personal details, many times in public. although research in non-health settings suggests that people self-disclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. by automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale, we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. although one's self-disclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. these channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. we discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.",963.0,695.0,32441.0
"clinical practice is heavily reliant on the use of unstructured text to document patient stories due to its expressive and flexible nature. however, a physician's capacity to recover information from text for clinical overview is severely affected when records get longer and time pressure increases. data visualization strategies have been explored to aid in information retrieval by replacing text with graphical summaries, though often at the cost of omitting important text features. this causes physician mistrust and limits real-world adoption. this work presents our investigation into the role and use of text in clinical practice, and reports on efforts to assess the best of both worlds---text and visualization---to facilitate clinical overview. we report on insights garnered from a field study, and the lessons learned from an iterative design process and evaluation of a text-visualization prototype, medstory, with 14 medical professionals. the results led to a number of grounded design recommendations to guide visualization design to support clinical text overview.","for our analysis, we rely on kang et al.’s five key features in hci improvisation.","this paper integrates theory, ethnography, and collaborative artwork to explore improvisational activity as both topic and tool of multidisciplinary hci inquiry. building on theories of improvisation drawn from art, music, hci and social science, and two ethnographic studies based on interviews, participant observation and collaborative art practice, we seek to elucidate the improvisational nature of practice in both art and ordinary action, including human-computer interaction. we identify five key features of improvisational action -- reflexivity, transgression, tension, listening, and interdependence -- and show how these can deepen and extend both linear and open-ended methodologies in hci and design. we conclude by highlighting collaborative engagement based on 'intermodulation' as a tool of multidisciplinary inquiry for hci research and design.",419.0,159.0,21046.0

"a tactile display on the back of a smartwatch is an attractive output option; however, its channel capacity is limited owing to the small contact area. in order to expand the channel capacity, we considered using two perceptually distinct types of stimuli, wind and vibration, together on the same skin area. the result is a multimodal tactile display that combines wind and vibration to create ""colored"" tactile sensations on the wrist. as a first step toward this goal, we conducted in this study four user experiments with a wind-vibration tactile display to examine different ways of combining wind and vibration: individual, sequential, and simultaneous. the results revealed the sequential combination of wind and vibration to exhibit the highest potential, with an information transfer capacity of 3.29 bits. in particular, the transition of tactile modality was perceived at an accuracy of 98.52%. the current results confirm the feasibility and potential of a multimodal tactile display combining wind and vibration.","most recently, researchers suggest that differences in pricing strategies in online labor marketplaces could contribute to specific gender gaps in the bill rates workers set for themselves online.","in many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. however, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). in this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the united states (48.8% women) on upwork, a popular gig work platform. the median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. however, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. to better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities.",131.0,820.0,7687.0
"while much popular discussion of representation in games exists, there is very little rigorously collected data available from which to draw direct conclusions. in this study, we set out to address this gap by performing a census of playable characters across a large sample of contemporary games. we gathered data from 200 games including independently published (""indie"") games and so-called ""aaa"" titles from large publishers. while our initial analysis yielded some insight into the landscape of playable characters, it also highlighted the contingent, negotiated, and interpretive nature of representation in games. this led to additional analysis that emphasized the ways in which this negotiation manifests in research in the methods and metrics used to quantify representation. we argue that researchers studying representation in games need to treat it as a possibility space for a multitude of potential interpretations rather than a singular, measurable, phenomenon.","for instance, studied the perceptions of bystanders and owners in a smart home; they found that again perceived trust and social relationship are important factors in acceptability of information sharing across the smart home.","as the internet of things (iot) devices make their ways into people's homes, traditional dwellings are turning into smart homes. while prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. we conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. we identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). we highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. we discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes.",92.0,879.0,34317.0
"as colleges and universities continue their commitment to increasing access to higher education through offering education online and at scale, attention on teaching open-ended subjects online and at scale, mainly the arts, humanities, and the social sciences, remains limited. while existing work in scaling open-ended courses primarily focuses on the evaluation and feedback of open-ended assignments, there is a lack of understanding of how to effectively teach open-ended, university-level courses at scale. to better understand the needs of teaching large-scale, open-ended courses online effectively in a university setting, we conducted a mixed-methods study with university instructors and students, using surveys and interviews, and identified five critical pedagogical elements that distinguish the teaching and learning experiences in an open-ended course from that in a non-open-ended course. an overarching theme for the five elements was the need to support students' self-expression. we further uncovered open challenges and opportunities when incorporating the five critical pedagogical elements into large-scale, open-ended courses online in a university setting, and suggested six future research directions: (1) facilitate in-depth conversations, (2) create a studio-friendly environment, (3) adapt to open-ended assessment, (4) scale individual open-ended feedback, (5) establish trust for self-expression, and (6) personalize instruction and harness the benefits of student diversity.","inspired by the potential of acoustic levitation, the hci community has started to explore interaction issues around levitation interfaces, geometry and content creation or even simulators.","acoustic levitation enables a radical new type of human-computer interface composed of small levitating objects. for the first time, we investigate the selection of such objects, an important part of interaction with a levitating object display. we present point-and-shake, a mid-air pointing interaction for selecting levitating objects, with feedback given through object movement. we describe the implementation of this technique and present two user studies that evaluate it. the first study found that users could accurately (96%) and quickly (4.1s) select objects by pointing at them. the second study found that users were able to accurately (95%) and quickly (3s) select occluded objects. these results show that point-and-shake is an effective way of initiating interaction with levitating object displays.",1022.0,17.0,25646.0

"thermoplastic and fused deposition modeling (fdm) based 4d printing are rapidly expanding to allow for space- and material-saving 2d printed sheets morphing into 3d shapes when heated. however, to our knowledge, all the known examples are either origami-based models with obvious folding hinges, or beam-based models with holes on the morphing surfaces. morphing continuous double-curvature surfaces remains a challenge, both in terms of a tailored toolpath-planning strategy and a computational model that simulates it. additionally, neither approach takes surface texture as a design parameter in its computational pipeline. to extend the design space of fdm-based 4d printing, in geodesy, we focus on the morphing of continuous double-curvature surfaces or surface textures. we suggest a unique tool path - printing thermoplastics along 2d closed geodesic paths to form a surface with one raised continuous double-curvature tiles when exposed to heat. the design space is further extended to more complex geometries composed of a network of rising tiles (i.e., surface textures). both design components and the computational pipeline are explained in the paper, followed by several printed geometric examples.","many of the early work in this space, such as marking menus and its adaptations, such as hierarchical marking menus, wave menus, flower menus, wavelet menus, markpad, imaginary gestures, and m3 gesture menu, requires the user to memorize the mapping between a command and its corresponding gesture, thus making it hard for novice users to adopt.","despite their learning advantages in theory, marking menus have faced adoption challenges in practice, even on today's touchscreen-based mobile devices. we address these challenges by designing, implementing, and evaluating multiple versions of m3 gesture menu (m3), a reimagination of marking menus targeted at mobile interfaces. m3 is defined on a grid rather than in a radial space, relies on gestural shapes rather than directional marks, and has constant and stationary space use. our first controlled experiment on expert performance showed m3 was faster and less error-prone by a factor of two than traditional marking menus. a second experiment on learning demonstrated for the first time that users could successfully transition to recall-based execution of a dozen commands after three ten-minute practice sessions with both m3 and multi-stroke marking menu. together, m3, with its demonstrated resolution, learning, and space use benefits, contributes to the design and understanding of menu selection in the mobile-first era of end-user computing.",701.0,247.0,11451.0

"online mental health forums facilitate supportive relationships between peers that transcend national and cultural boundaries. while past work in medical anthropology indicates a central role of cultural identity in how individuals frame their mental well-being and distress, little research has been done to investigate the role of culture in seeking and providing mental health support on online forums. using data from two mental health forums, we analyze cross-cultural differences in mental health expression between people from different countries. we characterize these differences along three dimensions--identity, language use, and support behavior. through comparing usage of the platform by individuals from three asian countries with their counterparts from primarily western countries, we find that individuals from these less-represented countries mention their own country more often when expressing distress, use fewer clinical language terms, and are more likely to provide support to people from the same country as them, as expected from past work on mental health in these countries. contrary to past work, however, we find that the use of clinical mental health language is not affected over time by interacting with others in an international forum. while these findings are useful for understanding the role of culture in mental health support, they also have practical design implications for online forums. we find that the three dimensions of cultural differences we analyze are correlated with receiving effective support, and make design recommendations that can improve quality of support for the people in the minority on these forums.","because of the gaps in knowledge related to the natural complexity of fertility and the taboos related to the female body, several studies have focused on technology to support menstrual education and how people use online spaces to find information, support, and make sense of their experiences in varied fertility-related contexts, such as menopause, infertility, endometriosis, and vulvodynia.","self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. we explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. we qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. we found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. we discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. we also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area.",887.0,807.0,11901.0

"how can instructors group students into teams that interact and learn effectively together? one strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with ""good"" compositions such as skill diversity. another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. our work synthesizes these two strands of research. we describe an experiment (n=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. in two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. we collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. we also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. we distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments.","previous studies of status sharing have consistently found that individuals prefer to appear either away or offline, i.e., to remain “invisible”.","while mobile instant messaging (mim) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. we examine two design concepts for mim-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. we built mybutler, an android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with kakaotalk, a commercial mim app. during a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. we reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in mim communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of mim users in choosing whether to alert their messages. in terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. we found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations.",835.0,918.0,39285.0

"online multiplayer games like minecraft, gaining increasing popularity among present-day youth, include rich contexts for social interactions but are also rife with interpersonal conflict among players. research shows that a variety of socio-technical mechanisms (e.g., server rules, chat filters, use of in-game controls to ban players, etc.) aim to limit and/or eliminate social conflict in games like minecraft. however, avoiding social conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach. broadly defined in cscw literature as a phenomenon that may arise even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g., [easterbrook et al.,1993]). in fact, the aforementioned approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal differences that may occur in other social settings. furthermore, prior research has established the value of developing conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention interventions (e.g.,[shure, 1982], [aber et al., 1998]), for later success in any given interpersonal relationship. while games like minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions within online interest-driven settings. drawing from prior literature in cscw, youth wellness and prevention programs, we translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated minecraft server. the online program, titled survival lab, was designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). we conducted a field study for six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators, and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. our study data reveals that participating youth created community norms and developed insightful solutions to conflicts in survival lab. our research offers three key takeaways. firstly, online social games like minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social competencies among youth. secondly, the design features that support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are viable for collective or community-level outcomes. third and finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play a vital role in facilitating the development of conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among youth. we discuss the implications of our research for translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites and conclude with recommendations for future work.","a growing body of work has engagedwith this problem, proposing an ecosystem of stakeholders, and conducting literature surveys and interview studies to understand their goals.","as the use of machine learning (ml) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. while scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like hci, ml, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. this lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. to bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ml models. the characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. we present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.",933.0,952.0,4127.0

"converting widely-available 2d images and videos, captured using an rgb camera, to 3d can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. however, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only accurately estimating object location and orientation, but also requires knowing currently unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). a scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3d object properties. unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3d properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3d perception (i.e., humans do not ""see"" depth like a laser range finder). in this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3d state of a single target object. our approach can generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding various different objects that share a spatial relationship with the target object. we evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that our method can reduce errors in the target object's 3d location estimation by over 40%, while requiring only $35$% as much human time. our work introduces a novel way to enable groups of people with different perspectives and knowledge to achieve more accurate collective performance on challenging visual annotation tasks.",describe.,"empowering people through technology is of increasing concern in the hci community. however, there are different interpretations of empowerment, which diverge substantially. the same term thus describes an entire spectrum of research endeavours and goals. this conceptual unclarity hinders the development of a meaningful discourse and exchange. to better understand what empowerment means in our community, we reviewed 54 chi full papers using the terms empower and empowerment. based on our analysis and informed by prior writings on power and empowerment, we construct a framework that serves as a lens to analyze notions of empowerment in current hci research. finally, we discuss the implications of these notions of empowerment on approaches to technology design and offer recommendations for future work. with this analysis, we hope to add structure and terminological clarity to this growing and important facet of hci research.",935.0,242.0,40468.0

"the wide adoption of machine learning (ml) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ml models. some advocated the term ""machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ml models. this ""teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-ai interfaces. one promising learning paradigm is active learning (al), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. however, in current al settings, the human-ai interface remains minimal and opaque. a dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for al algorithms. in this work, we begin considering ai explanations as a core element of the human-ai interface for teaching machines. when a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. when a ml model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. when the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (xal), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable ai (xai) into an al setting. we conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with xal, to that of traditional al and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). our study shows benefits of ai explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to ai explanations, including task knowledge, ai experience and need for cognition. by reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for xal, and more broadly, machine teaching through ai explanations.","[1, 9, 60]), and financial gifts and lending – alongside a growing diversity of financial technologies, for example, mobile money, digital banking, virtual currencies, cash and cheques, and cryptocurrencies.","design and hci researchers are increasingly working with complex digital infrastructures, such as cryptocurrencies, distributed ledgers and smart contracts. these technologies will have a profound impact on digital systems and their audiences. however, given their emergent nature and technical complexity, involving non-specialists in the design of applications that employ these technologies is challenging. in this paper, we discuss these challenges and present geocoin, a location-based platform for embodied learning and speculative ideating with smart contracts. in collaborative workshops with geocoin, participants engaged with location-based smart contracts, using the platform to explore digital 'debit' and 'credit' zones in the city. these exercises led to the design of diverse distributed-ledger applications, for time-limited financial unions, participatory budgeting, and humanitarian aid. these results contribute to the hci community by demonstrating how an experiential prototype can support understanding of the complexities behind new digital infrastructures and facilitate participant engagement in ideation and design processes.",1041.0,162.0,39173.0

"understanding team viability --- a team's capacity for sustained and future success --- is essential for building effective teams. in this study, we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to train a viability classification model over a dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams. we train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. we find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 auc roc under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. from these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as 'but' and 'except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction. this work suggests opportunities for teams to assess, track, and visualize their own viability in real time as they collaborate.","this was the case for awareness cues, avatars and other interventions.","we present mini-me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing mixed reality (mr) remote collaboration between a local augmented reality (ar) user and a remote virtual reality (vr) user. the mini-me avatar represents the vr user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the ar user's field of view. a user study was conducted to evaluate mini-me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in vr assisting a local worker in ar, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. we found that the presence of the mini-me significantly improved social presence and the overall experience of mr collaboration.",1036.0,45.0,27886.0
"social media platforms are widely used by people to report, access, and share information during outbreaks and epidemics. although government agencies and healthcare institutions in developed regions are increasingly relying on social media to develop epidemic forecasts and outbreak response, there is a limited understanding of how people in developing regions interact on social media during outbreaks and what useful insights this dataset could offer during public health crises. in this work, we examined 28,688 tweets to identify public health issues during dengue epidemic in bangladesh and found several insights, such as irregularities in dengue diagnosis and treatment, shortage of blood supply for rh negative blood groups, and high local transmission of dengue during eid-ul-adha, that impact disease preparedness and outbreak response. we discuss the opportunities and challenges in analyzing tweets and outline how government agencies and healthcare institutions can use social media health data to inform policy making during public health crises.","a similar pattern has emerged with gender, where researchers are studying how makerspaces can be more inviting to women on the one hand [12,23], but also noting that women's engineering innovations have been cast as crafts and left out of dominant histories of technical innovation.","this paper describes the making core memory project, a design inquiry into the invisible work that went into assem-bling core memory, an early form of computer information storage initially woven by hand. drawing on feminist tradi-tions of situated knowing, we designed an electronic quilt and a series of participatory workshops that materialize the work of the core memory weavers. with this case we not only broaden dominant stories of design, but we also reflect on the entanglement of predominantly male, high status labor with the ostensibly low-status work of women's hands. by integrating design and archival research as a means of cultural analysis, we further expand conversations on design research methods within human-computer inter-action (hci), using design to reveal legacies of practice elided by contemporary technology cultures. in doing so, this paper highlights for hci scholars that worlds of hand-work and computing, or weaving and space travel, are not as separate as we might imagine them to be.",949.0,528.0,36446.0
"we propose virtualgrasp, a novel gestural approach to retrieve virtual objects in virtual reality. using virtualgrasp, a user retrieves an object by performing a barehanded gesture as if grasping its physical counterpart. the object-gesture mapping under this metaphor is of high intuitiveness, which enables users to easily discover, remember the gestures to retrieve the objects. we conducted three user studies to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. progressively, we investigated the consensus of the object-gesture mapping across users, the expressivity of grasping gestures, and the learnability and performance of the approach. results showed that users achieved high agreement on the mapping, with an average agreement score [35] of 0.68 (sd=0.27). without exposure to the gestures, users successfully retrieved 76% objects with virtualgrasp. a week after learning the mapping, they could recall the gestures for 93% objects.","[57], our results suggest that tracking accuracy, in our case hand and eye tracking, can have a notable impact on a system's usability.","entering text is one of the most common tasks when interacting with computing systems. virtual reality (vr) presents a challenge as neither the user's hands nor the physical input devices are directly visible. hence, conventional desktop peripherals are very slow, imprecise, and cumbersome. we developed a apparatus that tracks the user's hands, and a physical keyboard, and visualize them in vr. in a text input study with 32 participants, we investigated the achievable text entry speed and the effect of hand representations and transparency on typing performance, workload, and presence. with our apparatus, experienced typists benefited from seeing their hands, and reach almost outside-vr performance. inexperienced typists profited from semi-transparent hands, which enabled them to type just 5.6 wpm slower than with a regular desktop setup. we conclude that optimizing the visualization of hands in vr is important, especially for inexperienced typists, to enable a high typing performance.",77.0,343.0,32258.0
"we seek to make physical user interface (phui) design more like graphical user interface (gui) design by using a drag-and drop interface to place widgets, allowing widgets to be repositioned and by hiding implementation details. phuis are interfaces built from tangible widgets arranged on the surfaces of physical objects. phui layout will become more important as we move from rectangular screens to purpose-built interactive devices. approaches to phui layout based on sculpture make it difficult to reposition widgets, and software approaches do not involve placing widgets on the device exterior. we created phui-kit, a software approach to phui layout on 3d printed enclosures, which has a drag-and-drop interface, supports repositioning of widgets, and hides implementation details. we describe algorithms for placing widgets on curved surfaces, modifying the enclosure geometry, and routing wiring inside the enclosure. the tool is easy to use and supports a wide range of design possibilities.",deep learning has also been applied to generate new designs that fit user specifications .,"this paper presents dream lens, an interactive visual analysis tool for exploring and visualizing large-scale generative design datasets. unlike traditional computer aided design, where users create a single model, with generative design, users specify high-level goals and constraints, and the system automatically generates hundreds or thousands of candidates all meeting the design criteria. once a large collection of design variations is created, the designer is left with the task of finding the design, or set of designs, which best meets their requirements. this is a complicated task which could require analyzing the structural characteristics and visual aesthetics of the designs. two studies are conducted which demonstrate the usability and usefulness of the dream lens system, and a generatively designed dataset of 16,800 designs for a sample design problem is described and publicly released to encourage advancement in this area.",109.0,367.0,35247.0
"social virtual reality (social vr) is an emerging technology that has the potential to support unique social experiences for groups of older adults. in this paper we explore the use of social vr to support group reminiscence, an activity that has been shown to have a positive impact on the lives of older adults. we developed school days, a bespoke social vr application that enables groups of geographically dispersed older adults to meet in a virtual environment to reminisce about their school experiences. we conducted a user study over the course of 5 months with 16 participants aged 70--81 to evaluate how school days supported reminiscence. in this paper, we focus on how the use of reminiscence scaffolding features in school days impacted on the older adults' ability to participate more fully in the reminiscence activities. our results illustrate the value of social vr for connecting older adults over distance, and contribute new knowledge of how virtual environments can be designed to scaffold reminiscence; how techniques such as 3d conversation starters and individual artefacts can be used to scaffold reminiscence; and how pre-recorded holographic stories (avacasts) can be used to introduce new perspectives and prompt self-reflection. we contribute five design reflections aimed at guiding the design of future reminiscence tools in social vr.","following prior work on fairness perceptions, we introduce a ‘verifiable’ predictor pair in each scenario (‘height–dominant hand’ and ‘weight–vegetarian’) to assess participants’ ability to identify and exclude these predictors.","the increased reliance on algorithmic decision-making in socially impactful processes has intensified the calls for algorithms that are unbiased and procedurally fair. identifying fair predictors is an essential step in the construction of equitable algorithms, but the lack of ground-truth in fair predictor selection makes this a challenging task. in our study, we recruit 90 crowdworkers to judge the inclusion of various predictors for recidivism. we divide participants across three conditions with varying group composition. our results show that participants were able to make informed decisions on predictor selection. we find that agreement with the majority vote is higher when participants are part of a more diverse group. the presented workflow, which provides a scalable and practical approach to reach a diverse audience, allows researchers to capture participants' perceptions of fairness in private while simultaneously allowing for structured participant discussion.",1073.0,848.0,14607.0
"self-tracking physiological and psychological data poses the challenge of presentation and interpretation. insightful narratives for self-tracking data can motivate the user towards constructive self-reflection. one powerful form of narrative that engages audience across various culture and age groups is animated movies. we collected a week of self-reported mood and behavior data from each user and created in unity a personalized animation based on their data. we evaluated the impact of their video in a randomized control trial with a non-personalized animated video as control. we found that personalized videos tend to be more emotionally engaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indicated self-reflection about moods and behaviors, compared to non-personalized control videos.","when stigmatizing behaviours are being disclosed, moderators or a collection of users in online support groups may further reinforce harmful behavioural, cultural and social norms for an individual user.","online health communities (ohcs) provide support across conditions; for weight loss, ohcs offer support to foster positive behavior change. however, weight loss behaviors can also be subverted on ohcs to promote disordered eating practices. using comments as proxies for support, we use computational linguistic methods to juxtapose similarities and differences in two reddit weight loss communities, r/proed and r/loseit. we employ language modeling and find that word use in both communities is largely similar. then, by building a word embedding model, specifically a deep neural network on comment words, we contrast the context of word use and find differences that imply different behavior change goals in these ohcs. finally, these content and context norms predict whether a comment comes from r/proed or r/loseit. we show that norms matter in understanding how different ohcs provision support to promote behavior change and discuss the implications for design and moderation of ohcs.",251.0,663.0,43308.0
"expert disagreement is pervasive in clinical decision making and collective adjudication is a useful approach for resolving divergent assessments. prior work shows that expert disagreement can arise due to diverse factors including expert background, the quality and presentation of data, and guideline clarity. in this work, we study how these factors predict initial discrepancies in the context of medical time series analysis, examining why certain disagreements persist after adjudication, and how adjudication impacts clinical decisions. results from a case study with 36 experts and 4,543 adjudicated cases in a sleep stage classification task show that these factors contribute to both initial disagreement and resolvability, each in their own unique way. we provide evidence suggesting that structured adjudication can lead to significant revisions in treatment-relevant clinical parameters. our work demonstrates how structured adjudication can support consensus and facilitate a deep understanding of expert disagreement in medical data analysis.","we obtained data from ucsd digital collection, which contains 1.25m notebooks crawled from github during 2017.","computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. we present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. in the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on github, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. in a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. in a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. these studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. we conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.",896.0,31.0,18538.0

"learning from text is a constructive activity in which sentence-level information is combined by the reader to build coherent mental models. with increasingly complex texts, forming a mental model becomes challenging due to a lack of background knowledge, and limits in working memory and attention. to address this, we are taught knowledge externalization strategies such as active reading and diagramming. unfortunately, paper-and-pencil approaches may not always be appropriate, and software solutions create friction through difficult input modalities, limited workflow support, and barriers between reading and diagramming. for all but the simplest text, building coherent diagrams can be tedious and difficult. we propose active diagramming, an approach extending familiar active reading strategies to the task of diagram construction. our prototype, texsketch, combines pen-and-ink interactions with natural language processing to reduce the cost of producing diagrams while maintaining the cognitive effort necessary for comprehension. our user study finds that readers can effectively create diagrams without disrupting reading.","examples for areas in which cooperative ar has been studied include manual assembly tasks, crime scene investigation, games, healthcare, medical training and maintenance.","when player skill levels are not matched, games provide an unsatisfying player experience. player balancing is used across many digital game genres to address this, but has not been studied for co-located augmented reality (ar) tabletop games, where using boosts and handicaps can adjust for different player skill levels. in the setting of an ar table football game, we studied the importance of game balancing being triggered by the game system or the players, and whether player skill should be required to trigger game balancing. we implemented projected icons to prominently display game balancing mechanics in the ar table football game. in a within-subjects study (n=24), we found players prefer skill-based control over game balancing and that different triggers are perceived as having different fairness. further, the study showed that even game balancing that is perceived as unfair can provide enjoyable game experiences. based on our findings, we provide suggestions for player balancing in ar tabletop games.",752.0,165.0,27738.0

"continuous 'pseudocolor' maps visualize how a quantitative attribute varies smoothly over space. these maps are widely used by experts and lay citizens alike for communicating scientific and geographical data. a critical challenge for designers of these maps is selecting a color scheme that is both effective and aesthetically pleasing. although there exist empirically grounded guidelines for color choice in segmented maps (e.g., choropleths), continuous maps are significantly understudies, and their color-coding guidelines are largely based on expert opinion and design heuristics--many of these guidelines have yet to be verified experimentally. we conducted a series of crowdsourced experiments to investigate how the perception of continuous maps is affected by colormap characteristics and spatial frequency (a measure of data complexity). we find that spatial frequency significantly impacts the effectiveness of color encodes, but the precise effect is task-dependent. while rainbow schemes afforded the highest accuracy in quantity estimation irrespective of spatial complexity, divergent colormaps significantly outperformed other schemes in tasks requiring the perception of high-frequency patterns. we interpret these results in relation to current practices, and devise new and more granular guidelines for color mapping in continuous maps.","it would be interesting to compare morpheesplug to scis that have other mechanism other than pneumatic actuation, such as mechanical or manual.","in this work, we utilize visuo-haptic illusions to improve the perceived performance of encountered-type haptic devices, specifically shape displays, in virtual reality. shape displays are matrices of actuated pins that travel vertically to render physical shapes; however, they have limitations such as low resolution, small display size, and low pin speed. to address these limitations, we employ illusions such as redirection, scaling, and retargeting that take advantage of the visual dominance effect, the idea that vision often dominates when senses conflict. our evaluation of these techniques suggests that redirecting sloped lines with angles less than 40 degrees onto a horizontal line is an effective technique for increasing the perceived resolution of the display. scaling up the virtual object onto the shape display by a factor less than 1.8x can also increase the perceived resolution. finally, using vertical redirection a perceived 3x speed increase can be achieved.",270.0,149.0,5839.0

"the relationships between sounds and their perceived meaning and connotations are complex, making auditory perception an important factor to consider when designing sonification systems. listeners often have a mental model of how a data variable should sound during sonification and this model is not considered in most data:sound mappings. this can lead to mappings that are difficult to use and can cause confusion. to investigate this issue, we conducted a magnitude estimation experiment to map how roughness, noise and pitch relate to the perceived magnitude of stress, error and danger. these parameters were chosen due to previous findings which suggest perceptual congruency between these auditory sensations and conceptual variables. results from this experiment show that polarity and scaling preference are dependent on the data:sound mapping. this work provides polarity and scaling values that may be directly utilised by sonification designers to improve auditory displays in areas such as accessible and mobile computing, process-monitoring and biofeedback.","in this context, existing research has recognized the potential of in-vehicle interventions by exploring novel types of interventions that can be applied in the car without compromising driver safety, such as guided breathing exercises or personalized voice assistants.","this paper investigates personalized voice characters for in-car speech interfaces. in particular, we report on how we designed different personalities for voice assistants and compared them in a real world driving study. voice assistants have become important for a wide range of use cases, yet current interfaces are using the same style of auditory response in every situation, despite varying user needs and personalities. to close this gap, we designed four assistant personalities (friend, admirer, aunt, and butler) and compared them to a baseline (default) in a between-subject study in real traffic conditions. our results show higher likability and trust for assistants that correctly match the user's personality while we observed lower likability, trust, satisfaction, and usefulness for incorrectly matched personalities, each in comparison with the default character. we discuss design aspects for voice assistants in different automotive use cases.",608.0,704.0,32609.0

"local governments still depend on traditional town halls for community consultation, despite problems such as a lack of inclusive participation for attendees and difficulty for civic organizers to capture attendees' feedback in reports. building on a formative study with 66 town hall attendees and 20 organizers, we designed and developed communityclick, a communitysourcing system that captures attendees' feedback in an inclusive manner and enables organizers to author more comprehensive reports. during the meeting, in addition to recording meeting audio to capture vocal attendees' feedback, we modify iclickers to give voice to reticent attendees by allowing them to provide real-time feedback beyond a binary signal. this information then automatically feeds into a meeting transcript augmented with attendees' feedback and organizers' tags. the augmented transcript along with a feedback-weighted summary of the transcript generated from text analysis methods is incorporated into an interactive authoring tool for organizers to write reports. from a field experiment at a town hall meeting, we demonstrate how communityclick can improve inclusivity by providing multiple avenues for attendees to share opinions. additionally, interviews with eight expert organizers demonstrate communityclick's utility in creating more comprehensive and accurate reports to inform critical civic decision-making. we discuss the possibility of integrating communityclick with town hall meetings in the future as well as expanding to other domains.","traditional image processing methods: edge/contour detection methods detect and merge edges into ui elements, which can work well on simple guis, but can fall short on images (e.g., gradient background, photos) or complex gui layouts.","interface designers often use screenshot images of example designs as building blocks for new designs. since images are unstructured and hard to edit, designers typically reconstruct screenshots with vector graphics tools in order to reuse or edit parts of the design. unfortunately, this reconstruction process is tedious and slow. we present rewire, an interactive system that helps designers leverage example screenshots. rewire automatically infers a vector representation of screenshots where each ui component is a separate object with editable shape and style properties. based on this representation, the system provides three design assistance modes that help designers reuse or redraw components of the example design. the results from our quantitative and user evaluations demonstrate that rewire can generate accurate vector representations of interface screenshots found in the wild and that design assistance enables users to reconstruct and edit example designs more efficiently compared to a baseline design tool.",1019.0,501.0,16554.0
"augmented reality (ar) applications are growing in popularity in educational settings. while the effects of ar experiences on learning have been widely studied, there is relatively less research on understanding the impact of ar on the dynamics of co-located collaborative learning, specifically in the context of novices programming robots. educational robotics are a powerful learning context because they engage students with problem solving, critical thinking, stem (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) concepts, and collaboration skills. however, such collaborations can suffer due to students having unequal access to resources or dominant peers. in this research we investigate how augmented reality impacts learning and collaboration while peers engage in robot programming activities. we use a mixed methods approach to measure how participants are learning, manipulating resources, and engaging in problem solving activities with peers. we investigate how these behaviors are impacted by the presence of augmented reality visualizations, and by participants? proximity to resources. we find that augmented reality improved overall group learning and collaboration. detailed analysis shows that ar strongly helps one participant more than the other, by improving their ability to learn and contribute while remaining engaged with the robot. furthermore, augmented reality helps both participants maintain a common ground and balance contributions during problem solving activities. we discuss the implications of these results for designing ar and non-ar collaborative interfaces.","the gender neutral voice assistant rain was created to embody this concept and was deployed for a week, throughout which the character of the device evolved from protective to invasive, in order to determine the tipping point or the ‘creepy line’ for the participants.","through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.",1051.0,709.0,17901.0

"messaging is a common mode of communication, with conversations written informally between individuals. interpreting emotional affect from messaging data can lead to a powerful form of reflection or act as a support for clinical therapy. existing analysis techniques for social media commonly use liwc and vader for automated sentiment estimation. we correlate liwc, vader, and ratings from human reviewers with affect scores from 25 participants. we explore differences in how and when each technique is successful. results show that human review does better than vader, the best automated technique, when humans are judging positive affect ($r_s=0.45$ correlation when confident, $r_s=0.30$ overall). surprisingly, human reviewers only do slightly better than vader when judging negative affect ($r_s=0.38$ correlation when confident, $r_s=0.29$ overall). compared to prior literature, vader correlates more closely with panas scores for private messaging than public social media. our results indicate that while any technique that serves as a proxy for panas scores has moderate correlation at best, there are some areas to improve the automated techniques by better considering context and timing in conversations.","moving towards devices, instead of material properties, made from metamaterials, the integration of mechanisms, computation and shape-change into metamaterial structures have been shown.","we present metamaterial textures---3d printed surface geometries that can perform a controlled transition between two or more textures. metamaterial textures are integrated into 3d printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. inspired by foldable paper sheets (""origami"") and surface wrinkling, our 3d printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold when compressed by an external global force. unlike origami, however, metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. this allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. metamaterial textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed, or stood on. this allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. we present an editor assists users in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces, and previewing their deformation.",976.0,334.0,41100.0
"with the ongoing debate on 'freedom of speech' vs. 'hate speech,' there is an urgent need to carefully understand the consequences of the inevitable culmination of the two, i.e., 'freedom of hate speech' over time. an ideal scenario to understand this would be to observe the effects of hate speech in an (almost) unrestricted environment. hence, we perform the first temporal analysis of hate speech on gab.com, a social media site with very loose moderation policy. we first generate temporal snapshots of gab from millions of posts and users. using these temporal snapshots, we compute an activity vector based on degroot model to identify hateful users. the amount of hate speech in gab is steadily increasing and the new users are becoming hateful at an increased and faster rate. further, our analysis analysis reveals that the hate users are occupying the prominent positions in the gab network. also, the language used by the community as a whole seem to correlate more with that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful ones. we discuss how, many crucial design questions in cscw open up from our work.","[77], advocated that new interactive designs supporting collaboration can be used to overcome engineering limitations.","paired role-play is a common collaborative activity in language learning classrooms, adding meaning and cultural context to the learning process. this is complemented by teachers' immediate and explicit feedback. interactive tools that provide explicit feedback during collaborative learning are scarce, however. more commonly, supporting dialogue practice takes the form of computer-aided single-student read-and-record activities. this limitation is partly due to the complexity of processing language learners' speech in unconstrained tasks. in this paper, we assess the value of pronunciation error detection algorithms within a realistic, software-aided, paired role-playing task with beginning learners of french. we found that students' pronunciations improve regardless of the type of error detector employed -- even for those using simple heuristics. we suggest that speech technologies for language learning have been too focused on engineering goals. instead, new interactive designs supporting collaboration may be used to overcome engineering limitations and properly support students' engagement.",957.0,354.0,41170.0

"narratives are fundamental to our perception of the world and are pervasive in all activities that involve the representation of events in time. yet, modern online information systems do not incorporate narratives in their representation of events occurring over time. this article aims to bridge this gap, combining the theory of narrative representations with the data from modern online systems. we make three key contributions: a theory-driven computational representation of narratives, a novel extraction algorithm to obtain these representations from data, and an evaluation of our approach. in particular, given the effectiveness of visual metaphors, we employ a route map metaphor to design a narrative map representation. the narrative map representation illustrates the events and stories in the narrative as a series of landmarks and routes on the map. each element of our representation is backed by a corresponding element from formal narrative theory, thus providing a solid theoretical background to our method. our approach extracts the underlying graph structure of the narrative map using a novel optimization technique focused on maximizing coherence while respecting structural and coverage constraints. we showcase the effectiveness of our approach by performing a user evaluation to assess the quality of the representation, metaphor, and visualization. evaluation results indicate that the narrative map representation is a powerful method to communicate complex narratives to individuals. our findings have implications for intelligence analysts, computational journalists, and misinformation researchers.","their findings suggest that the process of interpreting or making sense of an ai system frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, aimed at building trust not only between people and the ai system, but also between people within the organization.","as the use of machine learning (ml) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. while scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like hci, ml, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. this lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. to bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ml models. the characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. we present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.",1034.0,952.0,4600.0

"scientific discoveries are often driven by finding analogies in distant domains, but the growing number of papers makes it difficult to find relevant ideas in a single discipline, let alone distant analogies in other domains. to provide computational support for finding analogies across domains, we introduce solvent, a mixed-initiative system where humans annotate aspects of research papers that denote their background (the high-level problems being addressed), purpose (the specific problems being addressed), mechanism (how they achieved their purpose), and findings (what they learned/achieved), and a computational model constructs a semantic representation from these annotations that can be used to find analogies among the research papers. we demonstrate that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. these results demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in research communities.","in turn, a growing body of research has been discussing the wide range of issues associated with machine learning techniques and potential ways to mitigate them, including using more diverse datasets and embracing positionality in data labeling practices.","race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of classification in technical infrastructures-from the passport to social media. facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. what facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. in this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. we found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. we discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. we posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. we conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications.",799.0,942.0,34918.0
"effective collaboration in data science can leverage domain expertise from each team member and thus improve the quality and efficiency of the work. computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. in this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. we first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. the study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. however, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. the synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.","[29] focused on live-streamers in china, a context that is more similar to our situation, as the streamers there were also forming fan groups.","despite gaining traction in north america, live streaming has not reached the popularity it has in china, where live- streaming has a tremendous impact on the social behaviors of users. to better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in china. we present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. we also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. we also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.",859.0,463.0,39663.0

"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.","for example, pensight uses a fisheye camera mounted on the top of a digital pen to capture the user's hand gestures to enhance interactions .","we propose mounting a downward-facing camera above the top end of a digital tablet pen. this creates a unique and practical viewing angle for capturing the pen-holding hand and the immediate surroundings which can include the other hand. the fabrication of a prototype device is described and the enabled interaction design space is explored, including dominant and non-dominant hand pose recognition, tablet grip detection, hand gestures, capturing physical content in the environment, and detecting users and pens. a deep learning computer vision pipeline is developed for classification, regression, and keypoint detection to enable these interactions. example applications demonstrate usage scenarios and a qualitative user evaluation confirms the potential of the approach.",997.0,744.0,7522.0

"dimensionality reduction is a common method for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data. however, reasoning dynamically about the results of a dimensionality reduction is difficult. dimensionality-reduction algorithms use complex optimizations to reduce the number of dimensions of a dataset, but these new dimensions often lack a clear relation to the initial data dimensions, thus making them difficult to interpret. here we propose a visual interaction framework to improve dimensionality-reduction based exploratory data analysis. we introduce two interaction techniques, forward projection and backward projection, for dynamically reasoning about dimensionally reduced data. we also contribute two visualization techniques, prolines and feasibility maps, to facilitate the effective use of the proposed interactions. we apply our framework to pca and autoencoder-based dimensionality reductions. through data-exploration examples, we demonstrate how our visual interactions can improve the use of dimensionality reduction in exploratory data analysis.","although users may change their positions to alleviate the issues, frequently doing so can be tedious and impractical for selection-intensive applications, and may increase the spatial disorientation and induce motion sickness.","room-scale virtual reality (vr) has become an affordable consumer reality, with applications ranging from entertainment to productivity. however, the limited physical space available for room-scale vr in the typical home or office environment poses a significant problem. to solve this, physical spaces can be extended by amplifying the mapping of physical to virtual movement (translational gain). although amplified movement has been used since the earliest days of vr, little is known about how it influences reach-based interactions with virtual objects, now a standard feature of consumer vr. consequently, this paper explores the picking and placing of virtual objects in vr for the first time, with translational gains of between 1x (a one-to-one mapping of a 3.5m*3.5m virtual space to the same sized physical space) and 3x (10.5m*10.5m virtual mapped to 3.5m*3.5m physical). results show that reaching accuracy is maintained for up to 2x gain, however going beyond this diminishes accuracy and increases simulator sickness and perceived workload. we suggest gain levels of 1.5x to 1.75x can be utilized without compromising the usability of a vr task, significantly expanding the bounds of interactive room-scale vr.",632.0,98.0,7511.0
"we present metamaterial textures---3d printed surface geometries that can perform a controlled transition between two or more textures. metamaterial textures are integrated into 3d printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. inspired by foldable paper sheets (""origami"") and surface wrinkling, our 3d printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold when compressed by an external global force. unlike origami, however, metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. this allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. metamaterial textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed, or stood on. this allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. we present an editor assists users in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces, and previewing their deformation.","previously, verbal social communication and proximity subjects were studied by projects such as sw4larp and hotaru.","designing wearable technology that supports physical and social engagement in a collocated setting is challenging. in this research, we reached out to an expert community of crafters of social experiences: larpers (live action role players). larpers and larp designers have a longstanding tradition of designing and making use of a variety of elements, such as costumes, physical objects, environments, and recently also digital artifacts. these are crafted in support of co-experience values that we argue can inform the design of social wearables. we engaged in a co-design process with a game designer and co-founder of a larp production company, and embedded the resulting social wearables in a larp. here, we present the results of this design and implementation process, and articulate design affordances that resonate with our larp designer' values. this work may inspire and inform researchers and designers creating wearable technology that is aimed at supporting collocated engagement.",334.0,459.0,26957.0
"we present symbiosissketch, a hybrid sketching system that combines drawing in air (3d) and on a drawing surface (2d) to create detailed 3d designs of arbitrary scale in an augmented reality (ar) setting. symbiosissketch leverages the complementary affordances of 3d (immersive, unconstrained, life-sized) and 2d (precise, constrained, ergonomic) interactions for in situ 3d conceptual design. a defining aspect of our system is the ongoing creation of surfaces from unorganized collections of 3d curves. these surfaces serve a dual purpose: as 3d canvases to map strokes drawn on a 2d tablet, and as shape proxies to occlude the physical environment and hidden curves in a 3d sketch. symbiosissketch users draw interchangeably on a 2d tablet or in 3d within an ergonomically comfortable canonical volume, mapped to arbitrary scale in ar. our evaluation study shows this hybrid technique to be easy to use in situ and effective in transcending the creative potential of either traditional sketching or drawing in air.","[70] used automated techniques to detect text-based dark patterns, such as framing, in a set of ~53k product pages from ~11k shopping websites.","dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions. we present automated techniques that enable experts to identify dark patterns on a large set of websites. using these techniques, we study shopping websites, which often use dark patterns to influence users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. analyzing ~53k product pages from ~11k shopping websites, we discover 1,818 dark pattern instances, together representing 15 types and 7 broader categories. we examine these dark patterns for deceptive practices, and find 183 websites that engage in such practices. we also uncover 22 third-party entities that offer dark patterns as a turnkey solution. finally, we develop a taxonomy of dark pattern characteristics that describes the underlying influence of the dark patterns and their potential harm on user decision-making. based on our findings, we make recommendations for stakeholders including researchers and regulators to study, mitigate, and minimize the use of these patterns.",183.0,901.0,10076.0

"polartrack is a novel camera-based approach to detecting and tracking mobile devices inside the capture volume. in polartrack, a polarization filter continuously rotates in front of an off-the-shelf color camera, which causes the displays of observed devices to periodically blink in the camera feed. the periodic blinking results from the physical characteristics of current displays, which shine polarized light either through an lc overlay to produce images or through a polarizer to reduce light reflections on oled displays. polartrack runs a simple detection algorithm on the camera feed to segment displays and track their locations and orientations, which makes polartrack particularly suitable as a tracking system for cross-device interaction with mobile devices. our evaluation of polartrack's tracking quality and comparison with state-of-the-art camera-based multi-device tracking showed a better tracking accuracy and precision with similar tracking reliability. polartrack works as standalone multi-device tracking but is also compatible with existing camera-based tracking systems and can complement them to compensate for their limitations.","how best to address data leakage into a system from information rightly belonging to non-users has been somewhat addressed at chi in work on smart door locks: that paper recommended blurring, filtering and noise to allow for full functionality of the system without intruding on the neighbors.","through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.",494.0,709.0,19983.0

"social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. for example, blue feed, red feed, a news feed created by the wall street journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. to combat the spread of fake news, facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. to systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. we found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption.","moreover, chancellor and counts identified that people from areas with low income and low educational attainment search for significantly more jobs in manufacturing, healthcare, construction, and retail.","we are in a transitional economic period emphasizing automation of physical jobs and the shift towards intellectual labor. how can we measure and understand human behaviors of job search, and how communities are adapting to these changes? we use internet search data to estimate employment demand in the united states. starting with 225 million raw job search queries in 2015 and 2016 from a popular search engine, we classify queries into one of 15 fields of employment with accuracy and f-1 of 97%, and use the resulting query volumes to estimate per-sector employment demand in u.s. counties. we validate against bureau of labor statistics measures, and then demonstrate benefits for communities, showing significant differences in the types of jobs searched for across socio-economic dimensions like poverty and education level. we discuss implications for macroeconomic measurement, as well as how community leaders, policy makers, and the field of hci can benefit.",822.0,121.0,27418.0

"how can instructors group students into teams that interact and learn effectively together? one strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with ""good"" compositions such as skill diversity. another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. our work synthesizes these two strands of research. we describe an experiment (n=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. in two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. we collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. we also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. we distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments.","other devices instrument on-body touch surfaces through wearable fingertip devices, clothing, or touchable tattoos.","skin-based touch input opens up new opportunities for direct, subtle, and expressive interaction. however, existing skin-worn sensors are restricted to single-touch input and limited by a low resolution. we present the first skin overlay that can capture high-resolution multi-touch input. our main contributions are: 1) based on an exploration of functional materials, we present a fabrication approach for printing thin and flexible multi-touch sensors for on-skin interactions. 2) we present the first non-rectangular multi-touch sensor overlay for use on skin and introduce a design tool that generates such sensors in custom shapes and sizes. 3) to validate the feasibility and versatility of our approach, we present four application examples and empirical results from two technical evaluations. they confirm that the sensor achieves a high signal-to-noise ratio on the body under various grounding conditions and has a high spatial accuracy even when subjected to strong deformations.",835.0,32.0,138.0

"this paper presents rolling-menu, a technique for selecting toolbar items, based on the use of roll gestures with a multidimensional device, the roly-poly mouse (rpm). rolling-menu reduces object-command transition, resulting in a better integration between command selection and direct manipulation of application objects. selecting a toolbar item with rolling-menu requires rolling rpm in a predefined direction corresponding to the item. we propose a design space of rolling-menu that includes different roll mapping and validation modes. a first user's study, with a simple toolbar containing up to 14 items, establishes that the best version of rolling-menu takes, on average, up to 29% less time than the mouse to select a toolbar item. moreover accuracy of the selection with rolling-menu is above 90%. both the validation mode and the mapping between roll direction and toolbar items influence the performance of rolling-menus. a second study compares the three best versions of rolling-menu with the mouse to select an item in two types of multidimensional toolbars: a toolbar containing dropdown lists, and a grid toolbar. results confirm the advantage of rolling-menu over a mouse.","for example, a typical notebook tends to be long and filled with interim notes and findings that may not contribute to the communication of the higher-level ideas and insights of the author.","computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. we present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. in the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on github, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. in a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. in a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. these studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. we conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.",365.0,31.0,44480.0

"social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. for example, blue feed, red feed, a news feed created by the wall street journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. to combat the spread of fake news, facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. to systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. we found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption.","all studies showing social presence and usability to increase at the same time were done with asymmetric tasks, while all studies showing no differences in usability despite significant differences in social presence used a symmetric task.","we present mini-me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing mixed reality (mr) remote collaboration between a local augmented reality (ar) user and a remote virtual reality (vr) user. the mini-me avatar represents the vr user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the ar user's field of view. a user study was conducted to evaluate mini-me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in vr assisting a local worker in ar, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. we found that the presence of the mini-me significantly improved social presence and the overall experience of mr collaboration.",822.0,45.0,27890.0
"understanding uncertainty is critical for many analytical tasks. one common approach is to encode data values and uncertainty values independently, using two visual variables. these resulting bivariate maps can be difficult to interpret, and interference between visual channels can reduce the discriminability of marks. to address this issue, we contribute value-suppressing uncertainty palettes (vsups). vsups allocate larger ranges of a visual channel to data when uncertainty is low, and smaller ranges when uncertainty is high. this non-uniform budgeting of the visual channels makes more economical use of the limited visual encoding space when uncertainty is low, and encourages more cautious decision-making when uncertainty is high. we demonstrate several examples of vsups, and present a crowdsourced evaluation showing that, compared to traditional bivariate maps, vsups encourage people to more heavily weight uncertainty information in decision-making tasks.","for instance, the interactive costume and the prosthetic robot, as described previously, both alter the somatic experience of the dancers through their own active and creative appropriation of the technological intervention.","in the 1920s, oskar schlemmer, artist in the bauhaus movement, created the triadic ballet costumes. these re-strict movement of dancers, creating new expressions. in-spired by this, we designed an interactive wire costume. it restricts lower body movements, and emphasizes arm movements spurring led-light 'sparks' and 'waves' wired in a tutu-like costume. the wire costume was introduced to a dancer who found that an unusual bond emerged be-tween her and the costume. we discuss how sensory altera-tion (sight, kinesthetic awareness and proprioception) and bodily training to adjust to the new soma, can result in nov-el, evocative forms of expression. the interactive costume can foster a certain mood, introduce feelings, and even embody a whole character -- only revealed once worn and danced. we describe a design exploration combining cul-tural and historical research, interviews with experts and material explorations that culminated in a novel prototype.",639.0,60.0,15688.0
"although the processing speed of computers has been drastically increasing year by year, users still have to wait for computers to complete tasks or to respond. to cope with this, several studies have proposed presenting certain visual information to users to change their perception of time passing as shorter, e.g., progress bars with animated ribbing or faster/slower virtual clocks. as speech interfaces such as smart speakers are becoming popular, a novel method is required to make users perceive the passing of time as shorter by presenting auditory stimuli. we thus prepared 20 pieces of auditory information as experimental stimuli; that is, 11 auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration but different numbers of 0.1-second sine-wave sounds and 9 other auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration and numbers of sounds but different interval patterns between the sounds. we conducted three experiments to figure out which kinds of auditory stimuli can change users' perception of time passing as shorter. we found that a 10.1-second auditory stimulus that has 0.1-second sine-wave sounds appearing 11 times with intervals between the sounds that narrow rapidly in a linear fashion was perceived as shortest at about 9.3 seconds, which was 7.6% shorter than the actual duration of the stimulus. we also found that different interval patterns of sounds in auditory information significantly affected users' perception of time passing as shorter, while different numbers of sounds did not.","by suggesting an improvisational model for co-designing online, we further kang et al.’s five key features of improvisation in hci towards designing together with children and adults in online synchronous situations:","this paper integrates theory, ethnography, and collaborative artwork to explore improvisational activity as both topic and tool of multidisciplinary hci inquiry. building on theories of improvisation drawn from art, music, hci and social science, and two ethnographic studies based on interviews, participant observation and collaborative art practice, we seek to elucidate the improvisational nature of practice in both art and ordinary action, including human-computer interaction. we identify five key features of improvisational action -- reflexivity, transgression, tension, listening, and interdependence -- and show how these can deepen and extend both linear and open-ended methodologies in hci and design. we conclude by highlighting collaborative engagement based on 'intermodulation' as a tool of multidisciplinary inquiry for hci research and design.",754.0,159.0,21078.0

"race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of classification in technical infrastructures-from the passport to social media. facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. what facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. in this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. we found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. we discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. we posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. we conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications.","overall, related work has provided insights into current shortcomings in voice assistant interaction and how users perceive conversations with voice assistants and their humanness contrary to human-human interaction.","voice user interfaces (vuis) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via 'assistant' devices. yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. by collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the amazon echo in participants' homes-informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis-our study documents the methodical practices of vui users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. we discuss how the vui is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. finally, we locate implications for the accountability of vui interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing 'conversational' interfaces.",942.0,637.0,15053.0
"in this paper, we use a materiality lens to explore how information and communication technologies condition interaction between citizens and policymakers of the u.s. congress. we work with ethnographic data - six months of observation in washington d.c. and 48 interviews with staff in the house of representatives. customer relation management systems (crms) used by congress are one of numerous technologies expected to enhance responsive communication between citizens and representatives. we find, instead, that these technologies promote the datafication of citizen information that configures and constrains how policymakers engage citizens as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. crms not only mediate communication between citizens and policymakers, they shape the idea of what communication between citizens and policymakers can be and how citizens are viewed in the eyes of policymakers and their staff. thus, we extend our understanding of the ways in which material configurations of communication technologies influence not only how communication acts unfolds, but also how each partner conceives of and engages with the other. this has dramatic implications for the possibilities of digital communication channels to enhance, or uphold, the ideals of a representative democracy.","for instance, one could interact on the cheek or sleeve to control ar goggles and input text using force, interact on the armchair of an augmented sofa to control a tv, or leverage force input in the context of thumb-to-finger interactions (figure 8).","we present forceboard, a pressure-based input technique that enables text entry by subtle finger motion. to enter text, users apply pressure to control a multi-letter-wide sliding cursor on a one-dimensional keyboard with alphabetical ordering, and confirm the selection with a quick release. we examined the error model of pressure control for successive and error-tolerant input, which was incorporated into a bayesian algorithm to infer user input. a user study showed that, after a 10-minute training, the average text entry rate reached 4.2 wpm (words per minute) for character-level input, and 11.0 wpm for word-level input. users reported that forceboard was easy to learn and interesting to use. these results demonstrated the feasibility of applying pressure as the main channel for text entry. we conclude by discussing the limitation, as well as the potential of forceboard to support interaction with constraints from form factor, social concern and physical environments.",867.0,525.0,12845.0

"donation-based crowdfunding platforms have an increasing number of campaigns on socially stigmatized topics. these platforms' widespread online reachability and the large flow of monetary donations have the potential to shape individuals' opinions by influencing their perceptions. however, little research has been done to investigate whether these campaigns impact individuals' opinions and how. we conducted an experiment to explore how an attitude-inconsistent campaign on fairness and equality for lgbtiq people influenced participants' opinion on this topic. although all the participants changed their perceived opinions after reading the support for the campaigns, participants opposing equality were less inclined to change their attitude than participants supporting equality. to examine this difference further, we conducted another experiment where participants were exposed to both attitude-consistent and attitude-inconsistent campaigns with varying levels of social support. participants opposing equality showed less sensitivity to the level of social support, and wanted to donate significantly more money to anti-equality campaigns compared to those who supported equality. results demonstrate the complex role of crowdfunding campaigns in shaping individuals' opinions on stigmatized topics.","much of the literature on distress disclosure on social media has focused on a single platform, yet a growing body of work concerns the constellation of the platforms utilized by users and the varied disclosure behaviors across platforms.","most us social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. for lgbtq+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. these choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. moreover, many lgbtq+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their lgbtq+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. this combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of lgbtq+ and other potentially stigmatized users. we adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 lgbtq+ social media users. we find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ""personal social media ecosystems"" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their lgbtq+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.",240.0,811.0,39500.0
"this paper brings together three distinct case studies to explore how social isolation and notions of liminality shape ontological security within communities on ""the edge"" of society. each case study exemplifies the differing nature of liminality in everyday contexts and the extent to which increased digitalisation perturbs it in multiple ways. taking an ethnographic approach, the research engaged with seafarers onboard container ships in european waters, communities in greenland and welfare claimants in the north east of england. it posits that technological innovation must attend to the routinisation of everyday life through which people establish ontological security if such innovation is to be supportive. the paper thus moves beyond existing hci scholarship by foregrounding the contextual and relational aspects of social isolation rather than the technological. it does so by advocating a ground-up design process that considers ontological security in relation to notions of liminality among communities on the edge.","they are conversational agents available through a number of devices such as smartphones, computers, and smart speakers, and are widely used in a number of contexts such as domestic and automotive settings.","voice user interfaces (vuis) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via 'assistant' devices. yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. by collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the amazon echo in participants' homes-informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis-our study documents the methodical practices of vui users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. we discuss how the vui is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. finally, we locate implications for the accountability of vui interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing 'conversational' interfaces.",734.0,637.0,15020.0

"in this work, we propose two ensemble methods leveraging a crowd workforce to improve video annotation, with a focus on video object segmentation. their shared principle is that while individual candidate results may likely be insufficient, they often complement each other so that they can be combined into something better than any of the individual results---the very spirit of collaborative working. for one, we extend a standard polygon-drawing interface to allow workers to annotate negative space, and combine the work of multiple workers instead of relying on a single best one as commonly done in crowdsourced image segmentation. for the other, we present a method to combine multiple automatic propagation algorithms with the help of the crowd. such combination requires an understanding of where the algorithms fail, which we gather using a novel coarse scribble video annotation task. we evaluate our ensemble methods, discuss our design choices for them, and make our web-based crowdsourcing tools and results publicly available.","many researchers have explored this rich interaction space by designing and recognizing hand gestures on and around different body parts, such as palm, arms, leg, face, nose, ear, and even the hair.","interacting with a smartphone using touch input and speech output is challenging for visually impaired people in mobile and public scenarios, where only one hand may be available for input (e.g., while holding a cane) and using the loudspeaker for speech output is constrained by environmental noise, privacy, and social concerns. to address these issues, we propose eartouch, a one-handed interaction technique that allows the users to interact with a smartphone using the ear to perform gestures on the touchscreen. users hold the phone to their ears and listen to speech output from the ear speaker privately. we report how the technique was designed, implemented, and evaluated through a series of studies. results show that eartouch is easy, efficient, fun and socially acceptable to use.",110.0,688.0,397.0

"in online communities, where billions of people strive to propagate their messages, understanding how wording affects success is of primary importance. in this work, we are interested in one particularly salient aspect of wording: brevity. what is the causal effect of brevity on message success? what are the linguistic traits of brevity? when is brevity beneficial, and when is it not? whereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success in observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd workers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd workers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. this allows us to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. we find that concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages up to a length reduction of 30--40%. the optimal reduction is on average between 10% and 20%. the observed effect is robust across different subpopulations of raters and is the strongest for raters who visit social media on a daily basis. finally, we discover unique linguistic and content traits of brevity and correlate them with the measured probability of success in order to distinguish effective from ineffective shortening strategies. overall, our findings are important for developing a better understanding of the effect of brevity on the success of messages in online social media.","however, the verification of online sources is full of challenges, including constantly changing environments, lack of action and cooperation with data owners, and lack of reliable reach data.","journalists are increasingly investigating and reporting on problematic online content such as misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories, leading to the creation of a new misinformation beat. the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on this kind of data is complex and nuanced. it is especially challenging as online actors attempt to undermine their work. through in-depth interviews with twelve journalists, we explore how they investigate and report on online misinformation and disinformation. our findings reveal some of the unique challenges of reporting on this beat, as well as the ways in which reporters overcome those challenges. we highlight and discuss how journalistic values could be better embedded into the design of tools to support their work, the power dynamics between social media companies and journalists, and the promise of collaborations as a way to support and educate journalists on this beat. this work provides contextual knowledge to researchers looking to better support investigative journalists - on the misinformation beat and beyond - as their work becomes more entangled in sociotechnical systems.",865.0,998.0,27123.0
"we use personality theory to compare self-presentation between multiple instagram accounts, investigating authenticity and consistency. many studies claim social media promote inauthentic self-presentation focused on socially desirable traits. at the same time, affordances suggest that self-presentation should be relatively consistent within one social medium. for 88 participants, we examine personality traits for 'real instagram' ('rinsta') versus 'fake instagram' ('finsta') accounts, comparing these with people's offline traits using mixed-methods. counterintuitively, we find finsta accounts often present socially undesirable traits. furthermore, different accounts on the same social medium reveal quite different styles of self-presentation. overall finstas are more extraverted, less conscientious, and less agreeable than rinstas, although equally neurotic as offline. interviews indicate trait differences arise from differing audience perceptions. a large anonymous rinsta audience promotes a carefully curated self. in contrast, a small but trusted finsta audience can engender more authentic, but negative self-presentation. we discuss design and theory implications.","these tools have seen rapid adoption by researchers, data analysts, and journalists in diverse fields.","computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. we present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. in the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on github, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. in a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. in a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. these studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. we conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.",779.0,31.0,44478.0

"researchers have long recognized the importance of using technology to support students' collaboration in learning and problem solving tasks. recently, there has been a lot of research in capturing and characterizing student discourse and how they regulate each other when they perform learning tasks in pairs or in small groups. in this paper, our goal is to dive a little deeper into how students collaborate, and the learning behaviors they exhibit when working in pairs on a learning by modeling task, while also teaching a virtual agent in the betty's brain system. we report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. the results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. a differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. the differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually.","therefore, a large body of work in the vr field has focused on conveying as much tangible information as possible from the real to the virtual world leading to more immersive experiences – for instance, rendering objects properties such as size, shape, texture, and weight.","we present haptic revolver, a handheld virtual reality controller that renders fingertip haptics when interacting with virtual surfaces. haptic revolver's core haptic element is an actuated wheel that raises and lowers underneath the finger to render contact with a virtual surface. as the user's finger moves along the surface of an object, the controller spins the wheel to render shear forces and motion under the fingertip. the wheel is interchangeable and can contain physical textures, shapes, edges, or active elements to provide different sensations to the user. because the controller is spatially tracked, these physical features can be spatially registered with the geometry of the virtual environment and rendered on-demand. we evaluated haptic revolver in two studies to understand how wheel speed and direction impact perceived realism. we also report qualitative feedback from users who explored three application scenarios with our controller.",816.0,85.0,12856.0

"machine-learned computer vision algorithms for tagging images are increasingly used by developers and researchers, having become popularized as easy-to-use ""cognitive services."" yet these tools struggle with gender recognition, particularly when processing images of women, people of color and non-binary individuals. socio-technical researchers have cited data bias as a key problem; training datasets often over-represent images of people and contexts that convey social stereotypes. the social psychology literature explains that people learn social stereotypes, in part, by observing others in particular roles and contexts, and can inadvertently learn to associate gender with scenes, occupations and activities. thus, we study the extent to which image tagging algorithms mimic this phenomenon. we design a controlled experiment, to examine the interdependence between algorithmic recognition of context and the depicted person's gender. in the spirit of auditing to understand machine behaviors, we create a highly controlled dataset of people images, imposed on gender-stereotyped backgrounds. our methodology is reproducible and our code publicly available. evaluating five proprietary algorithms, we find that in three, gender inference is hindered when a background is introduced. of the two that ""see"" both backgrounds and gender, it is the one whose output is most consistent with human stereotyping processes that is superior in recognizing gender. we discuss the accuracy--fairness trade-off, as well as the importance of auditing black boxes in better understanding this double-edged sword.","notable examples include the investigation of microworkers’ working preferences, how they incorporate their work into their lives, and the types of tools they use.","crowdworkers regularly support their work with scripts, extensions, and software to enhance their productivity. despite their evident significance, little is understood regarding how these tools affect crowdworkers' quality of life and work. in this study, we report findings from an interview study (n=21) aimed at exploring the tooling practices used by full-time crowdworkers on amazon mechanical turk. our interview data suggests that the tooling utilized by crowdworkers (1) strongly contributes to the fragmentation of microwork by enabling task switching and multitasking behavior; (2) promotes the fragmentation of crowdworkers' work-life boundaries by relying on tooling that encourages a 'work-anywhere' attitude; and (3) aids the fragmentation of social ties within worker communities through limited tooling access. our findings have implications for building systems that unify crowdworkers' work practice in support of their productivity and well-being.",1038.0,844.0,27578.0

"learning-based gaze estimation has significant potential to enable attentive user interfaces and gaze-based interaction on the billions of camera-equipped handheld devices and ambient displays. while training accurate person- and device-independent gaze estimators remains challenging, person-specific training is feasible but requires tedious data collection for each target device. to address these limitations, we present the first method to train person-specific gaze estimators across multiple devices. at the core of our method is a single convolutional neural network with shared feature extraction layers and device-specific branches that we train from face images and corresponding on-screen gaze locations. detailed evaluations on a new dataset of interactions with five common devices (mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, smart tv) and three common applications (mobile game, text editing, media center) demonstrate the significant potential of cross-device training. we further explore training with gaze locations derived from natural interactions, such as mouse or touch input.","our study shows that data and technology can enable individuals to learn about their bodies and gain more fertility knowledge, make the internal fertility processes “visible”, and provide individuals a sense of control over their bodies and fertility experiences.","self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. we explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. we qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. we found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. we discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. we also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area.",621.0,807.0,11970.0

"people engaged in complex searches such as planning a vacation or understanding their medical symptoms are often overwhelmed by opening and managing many tabs. these challenges are exacerbated as search moves to smartphones and mobile devices where screen real-estate is limited and tasks are frequently suspended, resumed, and interleaved. rather than continue to utilize tab-based browsing for complex search, we introduce a new way of browsing through a scaffolded interface. the list of search results serves as a mutable workspace, where a user can track progress on a specific information query. the search query serves as a gateway into this workspace, accessed through a task-subtask hierarchy. we instantiate this in the bento mobile search system and investigate its effectiveness in three studies. we find converging evidence that users were able to make progress on their complex searching tasks with this structure, and find it more organized and easier to revisit.","we assert that there is evidence both of the value of guidelines, and also of the practical difficulties of creating those guidelines.","today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. however, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. in this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. we focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., jupyter notebook). we found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). we also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions.",249.0,906.0,5434.0
"in recent years, research has revealed gender biases in numerous software products. but although some researchers have found ways to improve gender participation in specific software projects, general methods focus mainly on detecting gender biases -- not fixing them. to help fill this gap, we investigated whether the gendermag bias detection method can lead directly to designs with fewer gender biases. in our 3-step investigation, two hci researchers analyzed an industrial software product using gendermag; we derived design changes to the product using the biases they found; and ran an empirical study of participants using the original product versus the new version. the results showed that using the method in this way did improve the software's inclusiveness: women succeeded more often in the new version than in the original; men's success rates improved too; and the gender gap entirely disappeared.","other initiatives like the citizen endo create a citizen science community to support research through individuals’ personal data, which can help in identifying symptoms and experiences related to endometriosis, an enigmatic disease related to female fertility.","the design of personal health informatics tools has traditionally been explored in self-monitoring and behavior change. there is an unmet opportunity to leverage self- tracking of individuals and study diseases and health conditions to learn patterns across groups. an open research question, however, is how to design engaging self-tracking tools that also facilitate learning at scale. furthermore, for conditions that are not well understood, a critical question is how to design such tools when it is unclear which data types are relevant to the disease. we outline the process of identifying design requirements for self-tracking endometriosis, a highly enigmatic and prevalent disease, through interviews (n=3), focus groups (n=27), surveys (n=741), and content analysis of an online endometriosis community (1500 posts, n=153 posters) and show value in triangulating across these methods. finally, we discuss tensions inherent in designing self-tracking tools for individual use and population analysis, making suggestions for overcoming these tensions.",717.0,562.0,11980.0
"what makes a city meaningful to its residents? what attracts people to live in a city and to care for it? today, we might see such questions as concerns for hci, given the emerging agendas of smart and connected cities, iot, and ubiquitous computing: city residents' perceptions of and attitudes towards smart city technologies will play a role in technology acceptance. theories of ""placemaking"" from humanist geography and urban planning address themselves to such concerns, and they have been taken up in hci and urban informatics research. this theory offers ideas for developing community attachment, heightening the legibility of the city, and intensifying lived experiences in the city. we add to this body of research with an analysis of several initiatives of city yeast, a community-based design collective in taiwan that proposes the metaphor of fermentation as an approach to placemaking. we unpack how this approach shapes their design practice and link its implications to urban informatics research in hci. we suggest that smart cities can also be pursued by leveraging the knowledge of city residents and helping to facilitate their participation in acts of perceiving, envisioning, and improving their local communities, including but not limited to smart and connected technologies.",our idea of involving exaggerated feedback and our system of determining the best set of exaggeration parameters can be beneficial for the general area of computer-aided language learning and exaggerated feedback systems in hci.,"paired role-play is a common collaborative activity in language learning classrooms, adding meaning and cultural context to the learning process. this is complemented by teachers' immediate and explicit feedback. interactive tools that provide explicit feedback during collaborative learning are scarce, however. more commonly, supporting dialogue practice takes the form of computer-aided single-student read-and-record activities. this limitation is partly due to the complexity of processing language learners' speech in unconstrained tasks. in this paper, we assess the value of pronunciation error detection algorithms within a realistic, software-aided, paired role-playing task with beginning learners of french. we found that students' pronunciations improve regardless of the type of error detector employed -- even for those using simple heuristics. we suggest that speech technologies for language learning have been too focused on engineering goals. instead, new interactive designs supporting collaboration may be used to overcome engineering limitations and properly support students' engagement.",708.0,354.0,41173.0
"how does the number of collaborators affect individual productivity? results of prior research have been conflicting, with some studies reporting an increase in individual productivity as the number of collaborators grows, while other studies showing that the free-rider effect skews the effort invested by individuals, making larger groups less productive. the difference between these schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their efficiency. we address this question by studying two planetary-scale collaborative systems: github and wikipedia. by analyzing the activity of over 2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics: the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but saturates at larger sizes. this effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the individual level. people tend to do more when collaborating with more people. we propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the non-linearity in collaboration effort. the proposed model is able to explain and predict group work dynamics in github and wikipedia by capturing their maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a principled, data-driven science of collaboration.",other work investigated tangible storytelling systems to support communication between grandparents and their grandchildren.,"grandparents and grandchildren that live apart often rely on communication technologies, such as messengers, video conferencing, and phone calls for maintaining relationships. while some of these systems are challenging for grandparents, others are less engaging for children. to facilitate communication, we developed storybox, a tangible device that allows sharing photos, tangible artifacts, and audio recordings of everyday life. we conducted a preliminary study with two families to identify design issues, and further refine the prototype. subsequently, we conducted a field study with four families for up to four weeks to better understand real-world use and examine inter-generational connectedness. we found that storybox was accessible, simple, and helped bridge the technological gap between grandparents and grandchildren. children communicated asynchronously in a playful and idiosyncratic manner, and grandparents shared past family memories. we provide insights on how to ease communication between different generations, engage them in sharing activities, and strengthen family relationships.",894.0,547.0,28855.0

"ot (operational transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. crdt (commutative replicated data type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of woot (without operational transformation). follow-up crdt variations are commonly labeled as ""post-ot"" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors. on top of that, crdt solutions have made broad claims of superiority over ot solutions, and often portrayed ot as an incorrect and inefficient technique. over one decade later, however, crdt is rarely found in working co-editors; ot remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. contradictions between the reality and crdt's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. to seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative ot and crdt solutions and working co-editors based on them. from this work, we have made important discoveries about ot and crdt, and revealed facts and evidences that refute crdt claims over ot on all accounts. these discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between ot and crdt in the real world. we report these results in a series of three articles. in this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between ot and crdt in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative crdt solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of ot and crdt. we hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding ot and crdt, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.","an avatar makes the interface more human-like, thereby improving understanding, engagement, and trust in novice programmers.","we are interested in increasing the ability of groups to collaborate efficiently by leveraging new advances in ai and conversational agent (ca) technology. given the longstanding debate on the necessity of embodiment for cas, bringing them to groups requires answering the questions of whether and how providing a ca with a face affects its interaction with the humans in a group. we explored these questions by comparing group decision-making sessions facilitated by an embodied agent, versus a voice-only agent. results of an experiment with 20 user groups revealed that while the embodiment improved various aspects of group's social perception of the agent (e.g., rapport, trust, intelligence, and power), its impact on the group-decision process and outcome was nuanced. drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss the pros and cons of embodiment, argue that the value of having a face depends on the types of assistance the agent provides, and lay out directions for future research.",905.0,389.0,14420.0
"claw is a handheld virtual reality controller that augments the typical controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. our controller enables three distinct interactions (grasping virtual object, touching virtual surfaces, and triggering) and changes its corresponding haptic rendering by sensing the differences in the user's grasp. a servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement. claw also supports a haptic force feedback in the trigger mode when the user holds a gun. we describe the design considerations for claw and evaluate its performance through two user studies. the first study obtained qualitative user feedback on the naturalness, effectiveness, and comfort when using the device. the second study investigated the ease of the transition between grasping and touching when using our device.","we also anticipate a future where fashion displays digital data, as has already been hinted at in fashion pieces which incorporate display technology.","in the 1920s, oskar schlemmer, artist in the bauhaus movement, created the triadic ballet costumes. these re-strict movement of dancers, creating new expressions. in-spired by this, we designed an interactive wire costume. it restricts lower body movements, and emphasizes arm movements spurring led-light 'sparks' and 'waves' wired in a tutu-like costume. the wire costume was introduced to a dancer who found that an unusual bond emerged be-tween her and the costume. we discuss how sensory altera-tion (sight, kinesthetic awareness and proprioception) and bodily training to adjust to the new soma, can result in nov-el, evocative forms of expression. the interactive costume can foster a certain mood, introduce feelings, and even embody a whole character -- only revealed once worn and danced. we describe a design exploration combining cul-tural and historical research, interviews with experts and material explorations that culminated in a novel prototype.",651.0,60.0,26265.0

"in online communities, where billions of people strive to propagate their messages, understanding how wording affects success is of primary importance. in this work, we are interested in one particularly salient aspect of wording: brevity. what is the causal effect of brevity on message success? what are the linguistic traits of brevity? when is brevity beneficial, and when is it not? whereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success in observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd workers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd workers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. this allows us to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. we find that concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages up to a length reduction of 30--40%. the optimal reduction is on average between 10% and 20%. the observed effect is robust across different subpopulations of raters and is the strongest for raters who visit social media on a daily basis. finally, we discover unique linguistic and content traits of brevity and correlate them with the measured probability of success in order to distinguish effective from ineffective shortening strategies. overall, our findings are important for developing a better understanding of the effect of brevity on the success of messages in online social media.","peer support networks following the conclusion of behaviour change interventions are one attempt to extend the life of these relationships as these require peers to share emotional, social or practical advice, whether located in-person or hosted online.","talk therapy is a common, effective, and desirable form of mental health treatment. yet, it is inaccessible to many people. enabling peers to chat online using effective principles of talk therapy could help scale this form of mental health care. to understand how such chats could be designed, we conducted a two-week field experiment with 40 people experiencing mental illnesses comparing two types of online chats-chats guided by prompts, and unguided chats. results show that anxiety was significantly reduced from pre-test to post-test. user feedback revealed that guided chats provided solutions to problems and new perspectives, and were perceived as ""deep,"" while unguided chats offered personal connection on shared experiences and were experienced as ""smooth."" we contribute the design of an online guided chat tool and insights into the design of peer support chat systems that guide users to initiate, maintain, and reciprocate emotional support.",865.0,329.0,43296.0

"the rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. this paper contributes to such research in two ways. first, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. second, through a controlled experimental study on amazon mechanical turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. we studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. these results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.",studies describing interactions with voice assistants and with autonomous cars found that both were perceived as creepy.,"we present a research through design project that explores how whispering influences the ways people experience and interact with voice assistants. the research project includes a co-speculation workshop and the use of a design probe, which culminated in the production of a design fiction short film. our design-led inquiry contributes with experiential qualities of whispering with voice assistants: creepiness, trust, and intimacy. furthermore, we present how whispering opens up new dimensions of how and when voice interaction could be used. we propose that designers of whispering voice assistants should reflect on how they facilitate the experiential qualities of creepiness, trust, and intimacy, and reflect on the potential challenges whispering brings to the relation between a user and a voice assistant.",870.0,784.0,44021.0

"end-to-end latency corresponds to the temporal difference between a user input and the corresponding output from a system. it has been shown to degrade user performance in both direct and indirect interaction. if it can be reduced to some extend, latency can also be compensated through software compensation by trying to predict the future position of the cursor based on previous positions, velocities and accelerations. in this paper, we propose a hybrid hardware and software prediction technique specifically designed for partially compensating end-to-end latency in indirect pointing. we combine a computer mouse with a high frequency accelerometer to predict the future location of the pointer using euler based equations. our prediction method results in more accurate prediction than previously introduced prediction algorithms for direct touch. a controlled experiment also revealed that it can improve target acquisition time in pointing tasks.","[10, 27, 41, 80]).","hci has become particularly interested in using machine learning (ml) to improve user experience (ux). however, some design researchers claim that there is a lack of design innovation in envisioning how ml might improve ux. we investigate this claim by analyzing 2,494 related hci research publications. our review confirmed a lack of research integrating ux and ml. to help span this gap, we mined our corpus to generate a topic landscape, mapping out 7 clusters of ml technical capabilities within hci. among them, we identified 3 under-explored clusters that design researchers can dig in and create sensitizing concepts for. to help operationalize these technical design materials, our analysis then identified value channels through which the technical capabilities can provide value for users: self, context, optimal, and utility-capability. the clusters and the value channels collectively mark starting places for envisioning new ways for ml technology to improve people's lives.",606.0,129.0,9969.0

"an understanding of medical diagnosis as it is practiced is essential for those seeking to support it using intelligent systems. through the case of epilepsy, we show that diagnosis is a situated, relational, and evolving process that accounts for information well beyond the patient's physiology, even for physiological phenomena like seizures. through observations and interviews with neurologists, we show that the meaning of brainwaves and other physiological data depends upon a range of patient-specific and contextual factors, such as age, comorbidities, and mealtimes. further, we show that diagnosis is partly determined by social factors such as the activities of caregivers and other clinicians, and environmental factors such as faulty electrical wiring. additionally, diagnostic classifications can evolve in response to new information: events that were once considered seizures can be reinterpreted as clinically irrelevant and vice versa. we contribute a broader sociotechnical perspective to literature on intelligent decision making in healthcare and discuss implications for the design of decision support systems that can better support the work of medical diagnosis.","in terms of the cooperation partner to be interacted with, a majority (18 out of 23) of studies investigated forms of human-to-human cooperation.","we present mini-me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing mixed reality (mr) remote collaboration between a local augmented reality (ar) user and a remote virtual reality (vr) user. the mini-me avatar represents the vr user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the ar user's field of view. a user study was conducted to evaluate mini-me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in vr assisting a local worker in ar, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. we found that the presence of the mini-me significantly improved social presence and the overall experience of mr collaboration.",1023.0,45.0,27788.0

"when online platforms rise and fall, sometimes communities fade away, and sometimes they pack their bags and relocate to a new home. to explore the causes and effects of online community migration, we examine transformative fandom, a longstanding, technology-agnostic community surrounding the creation, sharing, and discussion of creative works based on existing media. for over three decades, community members have left and joined many different online spaces, from usenet to tumblr to platforms of their own design. through analysis of 28 in-depth interviews and 1,886 survey responses from fandom participants, we traced these migrations, the reasons behind them, and their impact on the community. our findings highlight catalysts for migration that provide insights into factors that contribute to success and failure of platforms, including issues surrounding policy, design, and community. further insights into the disruptive consequences of migrations (such as social fragmentation and lost content) suggest ways that platforms might both support commitment and better support migration when it occurs.","for example, in tu et al.’s study, partner's knowledge about each other's availability and activities as well as contextual information like affect can facilitate sense making in communication and influence relationship dynamics.","in romantic relationships, instant messaging (im) can serve as a communication channel to maintain a sense of mutual presence and relational closeness when being physically separated. however, im is asynchronous by design. there can exist time delay for people to receive and reply to incoming messages, which may violate romantic partner's mutual expectation. limited understanding is available around how unintended and intended delays affect the relationship of romantic partners. this work examines how romantic partners grow, perceive, and use mutual knowledge about each other in delayed im to resolve the expectancy violation. we conducted a 7-day diary study on 16 pairs of romantic couples and used the diary entries as probes for post-study one-on-one interviews. our findings show that couples employ different strategies of information grounding to parse and resolve delayed im. based on these findings, we propose several theoretical and practical implications.",926.0,100.0,7802.0
"a growing number of people are working as part of on-line crowd work. crowd work is often thought to be low wage work. however, we know little about the wage distribution in practice and what causes low/high earnings in this setting. we recorded 2,676 workers performing 3.8 million tasks on amazon mechanical turk. our task-level analysis revealed that workers earned a median hourly wage of only ~$2/h, and only 4% earned more than $7.25/h. while the average requester pays more than $11/h, lower-paying requesters post much more work. our wage calculations are influenced by how unpaid work is accounted for, e.g., time spent searching for tasks, working on tasks that are rejected, and working on tasks that are ultimately not submitted. we further explore the characteristics of tasks and working patterns that yield higher hourly wages. our analysis informs platform design and worker tools to create a more positive future for crowd work.","finally, since directed diversity operates on a vector representation of prompting and ideations, it can also be used for ideation tasks beyond text as long as they can be represented in a feature vector by feature engineering or with deep learning approaches, such as furniture, mood boards, and emojis.","professional designers create mood boards to explore, visualize, and communicate hard-to-express ideas. we present imagecascade, an intelligent, collaborative ideation tool that combines individual and shared work spaces, as well as collaboration with multiple forms of intelligent agents. in the collection phase, imagecascade offers fluid transitions between serendipitous discovery of curated images via imagecascade, combined text- and image-based semantic search, and intelligent ai suggestions for finding new images. for later composition and reflection, imagecascade provides semantic labels, generated color palettes, and multiple tag clouds to help communicate the intent of the mood board. a study of nine professional designers revealed nuances in designers' preferences for designer-led, system-led, and mixed-initiative approaches that evolve throughout the design process. we discuss the challenges in creating effective human-computer partnerships for creative activities, and suggest directions for future research.",446.0,929.0,23823.0
"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.","the various disconnects participants experienced due to digital presentation inaccessibility creates an “assistance bubble” that can be a barrier for inclusion in professional and educational spaces, and negatively affected participants’ confidence and perceived self-efficacy.","children living with visual impairments (vis) are increasingly educated in mainstream rather than special schools. but knowledge about the challenges they face in inclusive schooling environments and how to design technology to overcome them remains scarce. we report findings from a field study involving interviews and observations of educators and children with/without vis in mainstream schools, in which we identified the ""teaching assistant bubble"" as a potential barrier to group learning, social play and independent mobility. we present co-design activities blending elements of future workshops, multisensory crafting, fictional inquiry and bodystorming, demonstrating that children with and without vis can jointly lead design processes and explore design spaces reflective of mixed visual abilities and shared experiences. we extend previous research by characterising challenges and opportunities for improving inclusive education of children with vis in mainstream schools, in terms of balancing assistance and independence, and reflect on the process and outcomes of co-designing with mixed-ability groups in this context.",882.0,344.0,16397.0
"we present metamaterial textures---3d printed surface geometries that can perform a controlled transition between two or more textures. metamaterial textures are integrated into 3d printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. inspired by foldable paper sheets (""origami"") and surface wrinkling, our 3d printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold when compressed by an external global force. unlike origami, however, metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. this allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. metamaterial textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed, or stood on. this allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. we present an editor assists users in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces, and previewing their deformation.","finally, 30% of our participants agreed that they “have a tab hoarding problem,’’ echoing a common sentiment found more generally in digital file preservation.","digital data, from texts to files and mobile applications, has become a pervasive component of our society. with seemingly unlimited storage in the cloud at their disposal, how do people approach data preservation, deciding what to keep and discard? we interviewed 23 participants with diverse backgrounds, asking them about their perceived digital data: what ""stuff"" they kept through the years, why, how they used it, and what they considered important. in an iterative analysis process, we uncovered a spectrum of tendencies that drive preservation strategies, with two extremes: hoarding (where participants accumulated large amounts of data, even if considered of little value) and minimalism (where they kept as little as possible, regularly cleaning their data). we contrast and compare the two extremes of the spectrum, characterize their nuanced nature, and discuss how our categorization compares to previously reported behaviors such as filing and piling, email cleaners and keepers. we conclude with broad implications for shaping technology.",334.0,584.0,8708.0

"social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. for example, blue feed, red feed, a news feed created by the wall street journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. to combat the spread of fake news, facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. to systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. we found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption.","[8]’s findings for small networks, our results show that torus-based layout have clear benefits over traditional node link diagrams for larger networks at least for these metrics.","we investigate visualisations of networks on a 2-dimensional torus topology, like an opened-up and flattened doughnut. that is, the network is drawn on a rectangular area while ""wrapping"" specific links around the border. previous work on torus drawings of networks has been mostly theoretical, limited to certain classes of networks, and not evaluated by human readability studies. we offer a simple interactive layout approach applicable to general graphs. we use this to find layouts affording better aesthetics in terms of conventional measures like more equal edge length and fewer crossings. in two controlled user studies we find that torus layout with either additional context or interactive panning provided significant performance improvement (in terms of error and time) over torus layout without either of these improvements, to the point that it is comparable to standard non-torus layout.",822.0,777.0,28344.0

"recent research has shown how to change the color of existing objects using photochromic materials. these materials can switch their appearance from transparent to colored when exposed to light of a certain wavelength. the color remains even when the object is removed from the light source. the process is fully reversible allowing users to recolor the object as many times as they want. so far, these systems have been limited to single color changes, i.e. changes from transparent to colored. in this paper, we present colormod, a method to extend this approach to multi-color changes (e.g., red-to-yellow). we accomplish this using a multi-color pattern with one color per voxel across the surface of the object. when recoloring the object, our system locally activates only those voxels that have the desired color and turns all other voxels off. we describe colormod's hardware/software system and its user interface that comes with a conversion tool for 3d printing as well as a painting tool that matches physical voxels with the desired appearance. we also contribute our own material formula for a 3d-printable photochromic ink.","an emerging group of scholars have started shedding light on these limitations of hci, and providing important design implications to overcome them.our study joins this scholarship, and argues that the existing praxis of urban hci, urban computing, and related fields seldom address the needs of different religious groups, and religiosity hardly gets mediated through urban spatial, political, and socio-cultural design within hci.","while persuasion has often been considered an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. this criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. we join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. based on our six-month long ethnography with the islamic communities in a bangladeshi city, kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. we further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of cscw literature in the various domains.",211.0,993.0,5263.0
"the rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. this paper contributes to such research in two ways. first, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. second, through a controlled experimental study on amazon mechanical turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. we studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. these results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.","we extended the aosp (android open source project) latinime keyboard4, which previous research portrayed as a reliable option for field studies.","we present a data logging concept, tool, and analyses to facilitate studies of everyday mobile touch keyboard use and free typing behaviour: 1) we propose a filtering concept to log typing without recording readable text and assess reactions to filters with a survey (n=349). 2) we release an android keyboard app and backend that implement this concept. 3) based on a three-week field study (n=30), we present the first analyses of keyboard use and typing biometrics on such free text typing data in the wild, including speed, postures, apps, auto correction, and word suggestions. we conclude that research on mobile keyboards benefits from observing free typing beyond the lab and discuss ideas for further studies.",870.0,253.0,20835.0

"online mental health forums facilitate supportive relationships between peers that transcend national and cultural boundaries. while past work in medical anthropology indicates a central role of cultural identity in how individuals frame their mental well-being and distress, little research has been done to investigate the role of culture in seeking and providing mental health support on online forums. using data from two mental health forums, we analyze cross-cultural differences in mental health expression between people from different countries. we characterize these differences along three dimensions--identity, language use, and support behavior. through comparing usage of the platform by individuals from three asian countries with their counterparts from primarily western countries, we find that individuals from these less-represented countries mention their own country more often when expressing distress, use fewer clinical language terms, and are more likely to provide support to people from the same country as them, as expected from past work on mental health in these countries. contrary to past work, however, we find that the use of clinical mental health language is not affected over time by interacting with others in an international forum. while these findings are useful for understanding the role of culture in mental health support, they also have practical design implications for online forums. we find that the three dimensions of cultural differences we analyze are correlated with receiving effective support, and make design recommendations that can improve quality of support for the people in the minority on these forums.","by recognising the home as a site of control and the smart home as an construct consisting of humans, the physical space, and technology this paper extends the ethical discourse of the smart home beyond surveillance, data, and security, and adds to that of control previously explored by feminist researchers.","this paper describes a qualitative study with 89 participants that details how abusers in intimate partner violence (ipv) contexts exploit technologies to intimidate, threaten, monitor, impersonate, harass, or otherwise harm their victims. we show that, at their core, many of the attacks in ipv contexts are technologically unsophisticated from the perspective of a security practitioner or researcher. for example, they are often carried out by a ui-bound adversary - an adversarial but authenticated user that interacts with a victim»s device or account via standard user interfaces - or by downloading and installing a ready-made application that enables spying on a victim. nevertheless, we show how the sociotechnical and relational factors that characterize ipv make such attacks both extremely damaging to victims and challenging to counteract, in part because they undermine the predominant threat models under which systems have been designed. we discuss the nature of these new ipv threat models and outline opportunities for hci research and design to mitigate these attacks.",887.0,664.0,24977.0

"the potential of narrative-rich games to impact emotions, attitudes, and behavior brings with it exciting opportunities and implications within both entertainment and serious game contexts. however, effects are not always consistent, potentially due to game choices not always being perceived as meaningful by the players. to examine these perceptual variations, we used a mixed-method approach. a qualitative study first investigated meaningful game choices from the players' perspectives. building on the themes developed in this first study, a quantitative study experimentally examined the effect of meaningful game choices on player experiences of appreciation, enjoyment, and narrative engagement. results highlight the importance of moral, social, and consequential characteristics in creating meaningful game choices, which positively affected appreciation. meaningfulness of game choices may therefore be crucial for narrative-rich games and interactive narratives to impact players.","fomo has also been identified in vr, particularly in 360° video viewing experiences.","this paper examines the sense of presence, attitude change, perspective-taking, and usability of a split-sphere, first-person perspective 360 degree video about gender inequality, in which people can choose to watch the narrative from the male or female character's perspective. sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to watch (1) the video in 360 degree split-view in a head-mounted display, (2) the same film as 180 degree in a hmd, or (3) a flat control version of the video on a laptop. the 360 degree split-sphere increased the viewers' feeling of personal responsibility for resolving gender inequality, desire to rewatch the video, fear of missing out, and feeling of missing the full story. the 180 degree video created the strongest sense of presence, embodiment, and understanding of the character. however, people with greater egocentric projection onto the male character felt less responsible for resolving gender inequality, particularly in the 360 degree split-view.",339.0,542.0,30770.0

"ot (operational transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. crdt (commutative replicated data type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of woot (without operational transformation). follow-up crdt variations are commonly labeled as ""post-ot"" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors. on top of that, crdt solutions have made broad claims of superiority over ot solutions, and often portrayed ot as an incorrect and inefficient technique. over one decade later, however, crdt is rarely found in working co-editors; ot remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. contradictions between the reality and crdt's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. to seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative ot and crdt solutions and working co-editors based on them. from this work, we have made important discoveries about ot and crdt, and revealed facts and evidences that refute crdt claims over ot on all accounts. these discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between ot and crdt in the real world. we report these results in a series of three articles. in this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between ot and crdt in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative crdt solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of ot and crdt. we hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding ot and crdt, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.","to attract participants with a variety of bill rates, we compensated participants beyond the median rates for these job categories (i.e.,  $28-$30/hour,).","in many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. however, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). in this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the united states (48.8% women) on upwork, a popular gig work platform. the median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. however, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. to better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities.",905.0,820.0,7712.0
"passive or actuated physical props can provide haptic feedback, leading to a satisfying sense of presence and realism in virtual reality. however, the mismatch between the physical and virtual surfaces (boundaries) can diminish user experience. haptic retargeting can overcome this limitation by utilizing visio-haptic effects. previous investigations in haptic retargeting have focused on methods for point based position retargeting and techniques for remapping 2d shapes or simple 3d shape changes. our approach extends haptic retargeting to complex, arbitrary shapes that provide a continuous mapping across all points on a boundary. this new approach also allows for multi-finger interaction. we describe a functional optimization to find the ideal spatial warping function with different goals: a maximum mapping smoothness, a minimum mismatch between the real and virtual world, or the combination of the two. we report on a preliminary user study of different optimization goals and elaborate potential applications through a set of demonstrations.","even though our work presents techniques that are particularly relevant for data visualization, recent concepts for 3d modeling and architecture or sketching show the applicability to other use cases.","we present symbiosissketch, a hybrid sketching system that combines drawing in air (3d) and on a drawing surface (2d) to create detailed 3d designs of arbitrary scale in an augmented reality (ar) setting. symbiosissketch leverages the complementary affordances of 3d (immersive, unconstrained, life-sized) and 2d (precise, constrained, ergonomic) interactions for in situ 3d conceptual design. a defining aspect of our system is the ongoing creation of surfaces from unorganized collections of 3d curves. these surfaces serve a dual purpose: as 3d canvases to map strokes drawn on a 2d tablet, and as shape proxies to occlude the physical environment and hidden curves in a 3d sketch. symbiosissketch users draw interchangeably on a 2d tablet or in 3d within an ergonomically comfortable canonical volume, mapped to arbitrary scale in ar. our evaluation study shows this hybrid technique to be easy to use in situ and effective in transcending the creative potential of either traditional sketching or drawing in air.",541.0,183.0,28531.0

"older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. to date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. to do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security.","some tools exist that allow content creators to rapidly prototype ar applications or model animations and dynamic content inside the virtual environment (e.g., oculus quill1).","the latest generations of smartphones with built-in ar capabilities enable a new class of mobile apps that merge digital and real-world content depending on a user's task, context, and preference. but even experienced mobile app designers face significant challenges: creating 2d/3d ar content remains difficult and time-consuming, and current mobile prototyping tools do not support ar views. there are separate tools for this; however, they require significant technical skill. this paper presents protoar which supplements rapid physical prototyping using paper and play-doh with new mobile cross-device multi-layer authoring and interactive capture tools to generate mobile screens and ar overlays from paper sketches, and quasi-3d content from 360-degree captures of clay models. we describe how protoar evolved over four design jams with students to enable interactive prototypes of mobile ar apps in less than 90 minutes, and discuss the advantages and insights protoar can give designers.",1061.0,351.0,22086.0

"the rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. this paper contributes to such research in two ways. first, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. second, through a controlled experimental study on amazon mechanical turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. we studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. these results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.","many people face challenges to conceive and recent studies have explored how individuals use self-tracking to try to overcome them and online forums for support, especially when living painful related events, such as pregnancy loss.","pregnancy loss is a common experience that is often not disclosed in spite of potential disclosure benefits such as social support. to understand how and why people disclose pregnancy loss online, we interviewed 27 women in the u.s. who are social media users and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. we developed a decision-making framework explaining pregnancy loss disclosures on identified social network sites (sns) such as facebook. we introduce network-level reciprocal disclosure, a theory of how disclosure reciprocity, usually applied to understand dyadic exchanges, can operate at the level of a social network to inform decision-making about stigmatized disclosures in identified snss. we find that 1) anonymous disclosures on other sites help facilitate disclosure on identified sites (e.g., facebook), and 2) awareness campaigns enable sharing about pregnancy loss for many who would not disclose otherwise. finally, we discuss conceptual and design implications. caution: this paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.",870.0,157.0,11899.0

"artificial subtle expressions (ases) are machine-like expressions used to convey a system's confidence level to users intuitively. so far, auditory ases using beep sounds, visual ases using leds, and motion ases using robot movements have been implemented and shown to be effective. in this paper, we propose a novel type of ase that uses vibration (vibrational ases). we implemented the vibrational ases on a smartphone and conducted experiments to confirm whether they can convey a system's confidence level to users in the same way as the other types of ases. the results clearly showed that vibrational ases were able to accurately and intuitively convey the designed confidence level to participants, demonstrating that ases can be applied in a variety of applications in real environments.",guidelines have been developed to support interaction design decisions with ai systems (e.g.[4]).,"advances in artificial intelligence (ai) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. principles for human-ai interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in ai and the growing uses of ai technologies in human-facing applications. we propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-ai interaction. these guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular ai-infused products. the results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness ai technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of human-ai interaction design principles.",475.0,667.0,23944.0
"in the paper we describe an exploration into the design of an authoring tool to support the creation of multimedia stories. we explicitly targeted children with no reading or writing skills and their educators. children in this age group often enjoy reading and creating stories together with adults and in so doing develop important pre-literacy skills. literature suggests that when children play an active role in these activities, with a high level of engagement and interaction, there is a significant increase in their vocabulary acquisition and an improvement in their communication skills. thus, we investigated these issues by conducting an explorative study in a pre-school class with fifteen children and three teachers. here, we describe the emerging challenges and provide design directions for an authoring system to support the co-creation of stories for pre-literate children.","this not only allows people to perform mobile crowdsourcing tasks nearly anywhere and at any time, but also allows entities seeking specific types of crowdsourced information to prompt mobile users to contribute them.","we consider the challenge of motivating and coordinating large numbers of people to contribute to solving local, communal problems through their existing routines. in order to design such ""on-the-go crowdsourcing"" systems, there is a need for mechanisms that can effectively coordinate contributions to address problem solving needs in the physical world while leveraging people's existing mobility with minimal disruption. we thus introduce hit-or-wait, a general decision-theoretic mechanism that intelligently controls decisions over when to notify a person of a task, in ways that reason both about system needs across tasks and about a helper's changing patterns of mobility. through simulations and a field study in the context of community-based lost-and-found, we demonstrate that using hit-or-wait enables a system to make efficient use of people's contributions with minimal disruptions to their routines without the need for explicit coordination. interviews with field study participants further suggest that highlighting an individual's contribution to the global goal may help people value their contributions more.",393.0,95.0,39814.0
"it is often assumed that visual cues, which highlight specific parts of a visualization to guide the audience's attention, facilitate visualization storytelling and presentation. this assumption has not been systematically studied. we present an in-lab experiment and a mechanical turk study to examine the effects of integral and separable visual cues on the recall and comprehension of visualizations that are accompanied by audio narration. eye-tracking data in the in-lab experiment confirm that cues helped the viewers focus on relevant parts of the visualization faster. we found that in general, visual cues did not have a significant effect on learning outcomes, but for specific cue techniques (e.g. glow) or specific chart types (e.g heatmap), cues significantly improved comprehension. based on these results, we discuss how presenters might select visual cues depending on the role of the cues and the visualization type.","specifically, with a large notebook repository, we train a translation model to identify mappings between existing code and text descriptions (e.g., comments) in code cells.","computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. we present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. in the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on github, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. in a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. in a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. these studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. we conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration.",714.0,31.0,18501.0
"digital gastronomy (dg) is a culinary concept that enhances traditional cooking with new hci capabilities, rather than replacing the chef with an autonomous machine. preliminary projects demonstrate implementation of dg via the deployment of digital instruments in a kitchen. here we contribute an alternative solution, demonstrating the use of a modular (silicone) mold and a genetic mold-arrangement algorithm to achieve a variety of shape permutations for a recipe, allowing the control of taste structures in the dish. the mold overcomes the slow production time of 3d food printing, while allowing for a high degree of flexibility in the numerous shapes produced. this flexibility enables us to satisfy chefs' and diners' diverse requirements. we present the mold's logic, arithmetic, design and special parts, the evolutionary algorithm, and a recipe, exploiting a new digital cooking concept of programmable edible taste structures and taste patterns to enrich user interaction with a given recipe.","awareness of one's partner has been explored in systems that display a partner's presence, activities, and mood through availability or sensed contextual information like location, motion, and heart rate, or a combination of these data.","while mobile instant messaging (mim) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. we examine two design concepts for mim-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. we built mybutler, an android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with kakaotalk, a commercial mim app. during a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. we reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in mim communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of mim users in choosing whether to alert their messages. in terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. we found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations.",398.0,918.0,20063.0

"questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (vr) evaluations and user studies. however, transitioning from virtual worlds to the physical world to respond to vr experience questionnaires can potentially lead to systematic biases. administering questionnaires in vr (invrqs) is becoming more common in contemporary research. this is based on the intuitive notion that invrqs may ease participation, reduce the break in presence (bip) and avoid biases. in this paper, we perform a systematic investigation into the effects of interrupting the vr experience through questionnaires using physiological data as a continuous and objective measure of presence. in a user study (n=50), we evaluated question-asking procedures using a vr shooter with two different levels of immersion. the users rated their player experience with a questionnaire either inside or outside of vr. our results indicate a reduced bip for the employed invrq without affecting the self-reported player experience.","although hci researchers have stressed the need for stakeholders to be involved in the development of algorithms, a thorough understanding on how users would make use of such tools is still missing – resulting in the absence of adequate tooling for the general public.","the increased reliance on algorithmic decision-making in socially impactful processes has intensified the calls for algorithms that are unbiased and procedurally fair. identifying fair predictors is an essential step in the construction of equitable algorithms, but the lack of ground-truth in fair predictor selection makes this a challenging task. in our study, we recruit 90 crowdworkers to judge the inclusion of various predictors for recidivism. we divide participants across three conditions with varying group composition. our results show that participants were able to make informed decisions on predictor selection. we find that agreement with the majority vote is higher when participants are part of a more diverse group. the presented workflow, which provides a scalable and practical approach to reach a diverse audience, allows researchers to capture participants' perceptions of fairness in private while simultaneously allowing for structured participant discussion.",741.0,848.0,14584.0
"adapting the visual designs of websites to a local target audience can be beneficial, because such design localization increases users' appeal, trust, and work efficiency. yet designers often find it difficult to decide when to adapt and how to adapt the designs, mainly because there are currently no guidelines that describe common website designs in various countries. we contribute the first large-scale analysis of 80,901 website designs across 44 countries, made available via an interactive web-based design catalog. using computational image metrics to compare the ~2,000 most visited websites per country, we found significant differences between several design aspects, such as a website's colorfulness, visual complexity, the number of text areas and the average saturation of colors. our results contribute a snapshot of web designs that users in 44 countries frequently see, showing that the design of websites with a global reach are more homogenized compared to local websites between countries.","while reliability, complexity, and interoperability are perceived as technological concerns, privacy is often forward as the primary ethical challenge for smart home technology.","as the internet of things (iot) devices make their ways into people's homes, traditional dwellings are turning into smart homes. while prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. we conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. we identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). we highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. we discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes.",335.0,879.0,24943.0
"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.","however, research also showed that grandparents seem to be more often the ones sharing stories or family memories compared to children, which might result in an unbalanced collection of memories.","grandparents and grandchildren that live apart often rely on communication technologies, such as messengers, video conferencing, and phone calls for maintaining relationships. while some of these systems are challenging for grandparents, others are less engaging for children. to facilitate communication, we developed storybox, a tangible device that allows sharing photos, tangible artifacts, and audio recordings of everyday life. we conducted a preliminary study with two families to identify design issues, and further refine the prototype. subsequently, we conducted a field study with four families for up to four weeks to better understand real-world use and examine inter-generational connectedness. we found that storybox was accessible, simple, and helped bridge the technological gap between grandparents and grandchildren. children communicated asynchronously in a playful and idiosyncratic manner, and grandparents shared past family memories. we provide insights on how to ease communication between different generations, engage them in sharing activities, and strengthen family relationships.",882.0,547.0,29080.0
"the interpretation of data is fundamental to machine learning. this paper investigates practices of image data annotation as performed in industrial contexts. we define data annotation as a sense-making practice, where annotators assign meaning to data through the use of labels. previous human-centered investigations have largely focused on annotators? subjectivity as a major cause of biased labels. we propose a wider view on this issue: guided by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted several weeks of fieldwork at two annotation companies. we analyzed which structures, power relations, and naturalized impositions shape the interpretation of data. our results show that the work of annotators is profoundly informed by the interests, values, and priorities of other actors above their station. arbitrary classifications are vertically imposed on annotators, and through them, on data. this imposition is largely naturalized. assigning meaning to data is often presented as a technical matter. this paper shows it is, in fact, an exercise of power with multiple implications for individuals and society.","based on prior literature, we include support for contextualization of scraps through enabling context notes that users can associate with a scrap and automatically inferring context (e.g., location, nearby landmarks).","as highlighted in recent work on remix in online content creation communities, people commonly take and appropriate digital content for new activities. less is known, however, about how people repurpose digital content as part of work. we report findings from an interview study with 19 individuals in which we explored how digital content in the workplace becomes a material for remix. our analysis emphasizes (i) how digital content is obtained from colleagues for remix, (ii) how content is made available for remix by others, and (iii) how digital content is transformed for remix. in attending to these broader processes of remix, we consider the roles of workplace technologies, such as those for file sharing, as well as social norms that mediate access, remix, and acknowledgement. we draw implications for design of technology that emphasize support for individuals in making digital content available for remix, and raising awareness of the context of that content.",980.0,594.0,39350.0
"learning games now play a role in both formal and informal learning, including foundational skills such as literacy. while feedback is recognised as a key pedagogical dimension of these games, particularly in early learning, there has been no research on how commercial games available to schools and parents reify learning theory into feedback. using a systematic content analysis, we examine how evidence-based feedback principles manifest in five widely-used learning games designed to foster young children's reading skills. our findings highlight strengths in how games deliver feedback when players succeed. many of the games, however, were inconsistent and not proactive when providing error feedback, often promoting trial and error strategies. furthermore, there was a lack of support for learning the game mechanics and a preference for task-oriented rewards less deeply embedded in the gameplay. our research provides a design and research agenda for the inclusion of feedback in early learning games.","[15], provision of thermal comfort to all at a given setpoint temperature (‘collective comfort’), while enshrined in standards and control systems, is unlikely to satisfy everyone.","thermal comfort in shared workplaces is often contested and impacts productivity, wellbeing, and energy use. yet, subjective and situated comfort experiences are rarely captured and engaged with. in this paper, we explore roles for digital surveys in capturing and visualising subjective experiences of comfort in situ for comfort management. we present findings from a 3-week field trial of our prototype system called thermokiosk, which we deployed in an open plan, shared office with a history of thermal comfort complaints. in interviews with occupants and members of facilities management, we find that the data and interactions can play an important role in initiating dialogue to understand and handle tensions, and point to design considerations for more systematically integrating them into workplace comfort practices.",371.0,380.0,5167.0
"in contrast to the extensive studies on static target pointing, much less formal understanding of moving target acquisition can be found in the hci literature. we designed a set of experiments to identify regularities in 1d unidirectional moving target selection, and found a ternary-gaussian model to be descriptive of the endpoint distribution in such tasks. the shape of the distribution as characterized by μ and σ in the gaussian model were primarily determined by the speed and size of the moving target. the model fits the empirical data well with 0.95 and 0.94 r2 values for μ and σ , respectively. we also demonstrated two extensions of the model, including 1) predicting error rates in moving target selection; and 2) a novel interaction technique to implicitly aid moving target selection. by applying them in a game interface design, we observed good performances in both predicting error rates (e.g., 2.7% mean absolute error) and assisting moving target selection (e.g., 33% or a greater increase in pointing accuracy).",activist networks connected through social networking sites (sns) have been found to be a successful modality in building solidarity.,"social networking sites (sns) offer youth activists and youth empowerment organizations (where adults help youth address community issues) opportunities for civic action. impression management is critical to youth empowerment organizations' work online, as they attempt to influence the opinions of their audience. however, there is a dearth of research characterizing online impression management in the context of youth empowerment organizations. to address this research gap, we conducted a qualitative study investigating the use of sns in a youth empowerment organization. using goffman's dramaturgical model, we characterized how youth tried to hack sns algorithms, and their desire to better identify their audience. our findings reveal how youth use sns to create authentic images and connections with their audience. on the other hand, we discuss adults' desire to convey a curated organizational image and challenges that arose. we conclude with design implications for tools that support impression management online for youth activists.",235.0,987.0,32837.0
"popularity systems, like twitter retweets, reddit upvotes, and pinterest pins have the potential to guide people toward posts that others liked. that, however, creates a feedback loop that reduces their informativeness: items marked as more popular get more attention, so that additional upvotes and retweets may simply reflect the increased attention and not independent information about the fraction of people that like the items. how much information remains? for example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item a to item b if item a had hundreds of upvotes on reddit and item b had only a few? we investigate using an internet game called guessthekarma that collects independent preference judgments (n=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. unlike the rating systems that dominate social media services, guessthekarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence ratings. overall, reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by guessthekarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the time. however, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. similarly, imgur view counts for the images were poor predictors except when there were orders of magnitude differences between the pairs. we conclude that popularity systems marked by feedback loops may convey a strong signal about population preferences, but only when comparing items that received vastly different popularity scores.","in turn, accessibility scholars have published what screen reader users want from their image descriptions.","alt text (short for ""alternative text"") is descriptive text associated with an image in html and other document formats. screen reader technologies speak the alt text aloud to people who are visually impaired. introduced with html 2.0 in 1995, the alt attribute has not evolved despite significant changes in technology over the past two decades. in light of the expanding volume, purpose, and importance of digital imagery, we reflect on how alt text could be supplemented to offer a richer experience of visual content to screen reader users. our contributions include articulating the design space of representations of visual content for screen reader users, prototypes illustrating several points within this design space, and evaluations of several of these new image representations with people who are blind. we close by discussing the implications of our taxonomy, prototypes, and user study findings.",826.0,58.0,22792.0
"public benefits programs help people afford necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. in the us, such programs are means-tested: applicants must complete long forms to prove financial distress before receiving aid. online benefits screening tools provide a gloss of such forms, advising households about their eligibility prior to completing full applications. if incorrectly implemented, screening tools may discourage qualified households from applying for benefits. unfortunately, errors in screening tools are difficult to detect because they surface one at a time and difficult to contest because unofficial determinations do not generate a paper trail. we introduce a method for auditing such tools in four steps: 1) generate test households, 2) automatically populate screening questions with household information and retrieve determinations, 3) translate eligibility guidelines into computer code to generate ground truth determinations, and 4) identify conflicting determinations to detect errors. we illustrated our method on a real screening tool with households modeled from census data. our method exposed major errors with corresponding examples to reproduce them. our work provides a necessary corrective to an already arduous benefits application process.","for conversational programmers, such problems have low utility value because the connection to activities in the workplace is unclear.","conversational programmers represent a class of learners who are not required to write any code, yet try to learn programming to improve their participation in technical conversations. we carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. however, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. our findings point to design opportunities in hci to invent learner-centered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.",948.0,508.0,3239.0
"autonomous vehicles have the potential to fundamentally change existing transportation systems. beyond legal concerns, these societal evolutions will critically depend on user acceptance. as an emerging mode of public transportation [7], autonomous mobility on demand (amod) is of particular interest in this context. the aim of the present study is to identify the main components of acceptability (before first use) and acceptance (after first use) of amod, following a user experience (ux) framework. to address this goal, we conducted three workshops (n=14) involving open discussions and a ride in an experimental autonomous shuttle. using a mixed-methods approach, we measured pre-immersion acceptability before immersing the participants in an on-demand transport scenario, and eventually measured post-immersion acceptance of amod. results show that participants were reassured about safety concerns, however they perceived the amod experience as ineffective. our findings highlight key factors to be taken into account when designing amod experiences.","at this stage, trying to conceive can be data intensive: individuals may track a wide variety of health-related data, such as menstrual cycle days, basal body temperature (bbt), ovulation predictor kits’ (opks) results, cervical mucus, and symptoms, to identify ovulation and time intercourse with the fertile window (i.e., period of the cycle when pregnancy is possible).","self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. we explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. we qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. we found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. we discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. we also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area.",609.0,807.0,11895.0
"in chronic conditions, patients and providers need support in understanding and managing illness over time. focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. we found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and providers; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. we note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues.","while listening to audiobooks, these manual efforts taken to curate and manage their digital archives could increase the intimacy with their data.","self-reflection is a central goal of personal informatics systems, and constructing visualizations from physical tokens has been found to help people reflect on data. however, so far, constructive physicalization has only been studied in lab environments with provided datasets. our qualitative study investigates the construction of personal physicalizations in people's domestic environments over 2-4 weeks. it contributes an understanding of (1) the process of creating personal physicalizations, (2) the types of personal insights facilitated, (3) the integration of self-reflection in the physicalization process, and (4) its benefits and challenges for self-reflection. we found that in constructive personal physicalization, data collection, construction and self-reflections are deeply intertwined. this extends previous models of visualization creation and data-driven self-reflection. we outline how benefits such as reflection through manual construction, personalization, and presence in everyday life can be transferred to a wider set of digital and physical systems.",1067.0,153.0,9686.0
"misinformation about critical issues such as climate change and vaccine safety is oftentimes amplified on online social and search platforms. the crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the assessments of experts at scale. in this work, we investigate news credibility assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between them differ. we gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken from 2 crowd groups---journalism students and upwork workers---as well as 2 expert groups---journalists and scientists---on a varied set of 50 news articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between public opinion and expert consensus. examining the ratings, we find differences in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication. finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. from these findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd processes that are tailored to specific crowds and types of content.","in improvisation, ‘listening’ highlights the importance of being aware of how people interact with the environment and with each other.","this paper integrates theory, ethnography, and collaborative artwork to explore improvisational activity as both topic and tool of multidisciplinary hci inquiry. building on theories of improvisation drawn from art, music, hci and social science, and two ethnographic studies based on interviews, participant observation and collaborative art practice, we seek to elucidate the improvisational nature of practice in both art and ordinary action, including human-computer interaction. we identify five key features of improvisational action -- reflexivity, transgression, tension, listening, and interdependence -- and show how these can deepen and extend both linear and open-ended methodologies in hci and design. we conclude by highlighting collaborative engagement based on 'intermodulation' as a tool of multidisciplinary inquiry for hci research and design.",958.0,159.0,21062.0
"a crucial aspect of virtual gaming experiences is the avatar: the player's virtual self-representation. while research has demonstrated benefits to using self-similar avatars in some virtual experiences, such avatars sometimes produce a more negative experience for women. to help researchers and game designers assess the cost-benefit tradeoffs of self-similar avatars, we compared players' performance and subjective experience in a search and rescue computer game when using two different photorealistic avatars: their own self or a friend, and when playing either a social (rescuing people) or a nonsocial (rescuing gems) version of the game. there was no effect of avatar appearance on players' performance or subjective experience in either game version, but we also found that women's experience with self-similar avatars was no more negative than men's. our results suggest that avatar appearance may not make a difference to players in certain game contexts.","finally, regarding the level of analysis, our study provides the first in-depth dialogue-level assessment, beyond, for example, phrasing of single commands, social vs functional talk, or nonverbal investigations of agent personalisation.","this paper investigates personalized voice characters for in-car speech interfaces. in particular, we report on how we designed different personalities for voice assistants and compared them in a real world driving study. voice assistants have become important for a wide range of use cases, yet current interfaces are using the same style of auditory response in every situation, despite varying user needs and personalities. to close this gap, we designed four assistant personalities (friend, admirer, aunt, and butler) and compared them to a baseline (default) in a between-subject study in real traffic conditions. our results show higher likability and trust for assistants that correctly match the user's personality while we observed lower likability, trust, satisfaction, and usefulness for incorrectly matched personalities, each in comparison with the default character. we discuss design aspects for voice assistants in different automotive use cases.",482.0,704.0,15054.0
"we present cluster touch, a combined user-independent and user-specific touch offset model that improves the accuracy of touch input on smartphones for people with motor impairments, and for people experiencing situational impairments while walking. cluster touch combines touch examples from multiple users to create a shared user-independent touch model, which is then updated with touch examples provided by an individual user to make it user-specific. owing to this combination, cluster touch allows people to quickly improve the accuracy of their smartphones by providing only 20 touch examples. in a user study with 12 people with motor impairments and 12 people without motor impairments, but who were walking, cluster touch improved touch accuracy by 14.65% for the former group and 6.81% for the latter group over the native touch sensor. furthermore, in an offline analysis of existing mobile interfaces, cluster touch improved touch accuracy by 8.21% and 4.84% over the native touch sensor for the two user groups, respectively.","considering these issues of literacy levels, we thus closely follow the methodology of, by using literacy level as a factor and, in our case, text complexity levels as another factor.","as automatic speech recognition (asr) improves in accuracy, it may become useful for transcribing spoken text in real-time for deaf and hard-of-hearing (dhh) individuals. to quantify users' comprehension and opinion of automatic captions, which inevitably contain some errors, we must identify appropriate methodologies for evaluation studies with dhh users, including quantitative measurement instruments suitable to the various literacy levels among the dhh population. a literature review guided our selection of several probes (e.g. multiple-choice comprehension-question accuracy or response time, scalar-questions about user estimation of asr errors or their impact, users' numerical estimation of accuracy), which we evaluated in a lab study with dhh users, wherein their literacy levels and the actual accuracy of each caption stimulus were factors. for some probes, participants with lower literacy had more positive subjective responses overall, and, for participants with particular literacy score ranges, some probes were insufficiently sensitive to distinguish between caption accuracy levels.",691.0,90.0,16751.0
"live streaming, which allows streamers to broadcast their work to live viewers, is an emerging practice for teaching and learning computer programming. participation in live streaming is growing rapidly, despite several apparent challenges, such as a general lack of training in pedagogy among streamers and scarce signals about a stream's characteristics (e.g., difficulty, style, and usefulness) to help viewers decide what to watch. to understand why people choose to participate in live streaming for teaching or learning programming, and how they cope with both apparent and non-obvious challenges, we interviewed 14 streamers and viewers about their experience with live streaming programming. among other results, we found that the casual and impromptu nature of live streaming makes it easier to prepare than pre-recorded videos, and viewers have the opportunity to shape the content and learning experience via real-time communication with both the streamer and each other. nonetheless, we identified several challenges that limit the potential of live streaming as a learning medium. for example, streamers voiced privacy and harassment concerns, and existing streaming platforms do not adequately support viewer-streamer interactions, adaptive learning, and discovery and selection of streaming content. based on these findings, we suggest specialized tools to facilitate knowledge sharing among people teaching and learning computer programming online, and we offer design recommendations that promote a healthy, safe, and engaging learning environment.",[52] argue that substantive progress has been made by comparing older categories of work with more recent developments in shci.,"more than a decade into sustainable hci (shci) research, the community is still struggling to converge on a shared understanding of sustainability and hci's role in addressing it. we think this is largely a positive sign, reflective of maturity; yet, lacking a clear set of aims and metrics for sustainability continues to be the community's impediment to progressing, hence we seek to articulate a vision around which the community can productively coalesce. drawing from recent shci publications, we identify commonalities that might form the basis of a shared understanding, and we show that this understanding closely aligns with the authoritative conception of a path to a sustainable future proffered by naomi klein in her book emphthis changes everything. we elaborate a set of contributions that shci is already making that can be unified under klein's narrative, and compare these categories of work to those found in past surveys of the field as evidence of substantive progress in shci.",1065.0,468.0,18060.0
"we explore the role of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions between people with dementia and young people. though meaningful social interaction is integral to quality of life in dementia, initiating conversation with a person with dementia can be challenging, especially for younger people who may lack knowledge of someone's life history. this can be further compounded without a nuanced understanding of the nature of dementia, along with an unfamiliarity in leading and maintaining conversation. we designed a mobile application - ticket to talk - to support intergenerational interactions by encouraging young people to collect media relevant to individuals with dementia to use in conversations with people with dementia. we evaluated ticket to talk through trials with two families, a care home, and groups of older people. we highlight difficulties in using technologies such as this as a conversational tool, the value of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions, and the potential to positively shape people with dementia's agency in social settings.","in that connection, biørn-hansen and håkansson's study on scaling up change in community organizations identifies three stages of scaling up change by distinguishing: the “sustaining” stage that refers to a relatively fixed implementation of an initiative's working routine and practice; the “growing” stage, that alludes to setting up and upgrading the technological infrastructure for a volunteer community, and the “spreading” stage that points to generating and distributing new skills and knowledge.","addressing calls in sustainable hci to scale up our work in hci targeting sustainability, and the current knowledge gap of how to do this practically, we here present a qualitative study of 10 sustainability-oriented community organizations that are working to scale up their change making. they are all loosely connected to a local transition network, meaning that they are aiming at transforming current practices in society, through local and practical action, to meet challenges related to climate change. we wanted to know how they try to scale up their change making, and what role ict plays in enabling scaling up. the study contributes new insights about three stages of scaling up, in which ict plays different roles. we conclude with implications for hci for how to support community organizations in scaling up, while keeping values important for working toward a more resilient society.",373.0,408.0,4903.0
"contemporary mobile devices continuously interrupt people with notifications in various and changing physical environments. as different places can have different social setting, understanding how disturbing an interruption might be to people around the user is not a straightforward task. to understand how users perceive disturbance in their social environment, we analyze the results of a 3-week user study with 50 participants using the experience sampling method and log analysis. we show that perceptions of disturbance are strongly related to the social norms surrounding the place, such as whether the place is considered private or public, even when controlling for the number of people around the user. furthermore, users' perceptions of disturbance are also related to the activity carried out on the phone, and the subjective perceptions of isolation from other people in the space. we conclude the paper by discussing how our findings can be used to design new mobile devices that are aware of the social norms and their users' environmental context.","previous work also suggests that even for relatively easy text, crowdsourced judging may underestimate the true error rate.","entering text on non-desktop computing devices is often done via an onscreen virtual keyboard. input on such keyboards normally consists of a sequence of noisy tap events that specify some amount of text, most commonly a single word. but is single word-at-a-time entry the best choice? this paper compares user performance and recognition accuracy of word-at-a-time, phrase-at-a-time, and sentence-at-a-time text entry on a smartwatch keyboard. we evaluate the impact of differing amounts of input in both text copy and free composition tasks. we found providing input of an entire sentence significantly improved entry rates from 26 wpm to 32 wpm while keeping character error rates below 4%. in offline experiments with more processing power and memory, sentence input was recognized with a much lower 2.0% error rate. our findings suggest virtual keyboards can enhance performance by encouraging users to provide more input per recognition event.",956.0,623.0,44391.0

"the widespread use of text-based search in user interfaces has led designers in visualization to occasionally add search functionality to their creations. yet it remains unclear how search may impact a person's behavior. given the unstructured context of the web, users may not have explicit information-seeking goals and designers cannot make assumptions about user attention. to bridge this gap, we observed the impact of integrating search with five visualizations across 830 online participants. in an unguided task, we find that (1) the presence of text-based search influences people's information-seeking goals, (2) search can alter the data that people explore and how they engage with it, and (3) the effects of search are amplified in visualizations where people are familiar with the underlying dataset. these results suggest that text-search in web visualizations drives users towards more diverse information seeking goals, and may be valuable in a range of existing visualization designs.","for example, in their deployment of ripple, a shirt that displayed a wearer's skin conductance, howell and colleagues found that people granted the system high degrees of authority over their feelings and, therefore, the feelings they conveyed to others.","biosensing displays, increasingly enrolled in emotional reflection, promise authoritative insight by presenting users' emotions as discrete categories. rather than machines interpreting emotions, we sought to explore an alternative with emotional biosensing displays in which users formed their own interpretations and felt comfortable critiquing the display. so, we designed, implemented, and deployed, as a technology probe, an emotional biosensory display: ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes color responding to the wearer's skin conductance, which is associated with excitement. 17 participants wore ripple over 2 days of daily life. while some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' ripple provided between body and emotion, for others ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had. despite our design intentions, we found participants rarely questioned the display's relation to their feelings. using biopolitics to speculate on ripple's surprising authority, we highlight ethical stakes of biosensory representations for sense of self and ways of feeling.",136.0,428.0,20069.0
"with a seemingly endless stream of tasks, on-demand labor markets appear to offer workers flexibility in when and how much they work. this research argues that platforms afford workers far less flexibility than widely believed. a large part of the ""inflexibility"" comes from tight deadlines imposed on tasks, leaving workers little control over their work schedules. we experimentally examined the impact of offering workers control of their time in on-demand crowdwork. we found that granting higher ""in-task flexibility"" dramatically affected the temporal dynamics of worker behavior and produced a larger amount of work with similar quality. in a second experiment, we measured the compensating differential and found that workers would give up significant compensation to control their time, indicating workers attach substantial value to in-task flexibility. our results suggest that designing tasks which give workers direct control of their time within tasks benefits both buyers and sellers of on-demand crowdwork.","listed five different points of view: 1st person, 3rd person, mirror, bird's eye and side angle.","many recent studies have explored user-defined interactions for touch and gesture-based systems through end-user elicitation. while these studies have facilitated the user-end of the human-computer dialogue, the subsequent design of gesture representations to communicate gestures to the user vary in style and consistency. our study explores how users interpret, enact, and refine gesture representations adapting techniques from recent elicitation studies. to inform our study design, we analyzed gesture representations from 30 elicitation papers and developed a taxonomy of design elements. we then conducted a partnered elicitation study with 30 participants producing 657 gesture representations accompanied by think-aloud data. we discuss design patterns and themes that emerged from our analysis, and supplement these findings with an in-depth look at users' mental models when perceiving and enacting gesture representations. finally, based on the results, we provide recommendations for practitioners in need of ""visual language"" guidelines to communicate possible user actions.",427.0,544.0,11017.0

"despite significant advances in automated spam detection, some spam content manages to evade detection and engage users. while the spam supply chain is well understood through previous research, there is little understanding of spam consumers. we focus on the demand side of the spam equation examining what drives users to click on spam via a large-scale analysis of de-identified, aggregated facebook log data (n=600,000). we find (1) that the volume of spam and clicking norms in a users' network are significantly related to individual consumption behavior; (2) that more active users are less likely to click, suggesting that experience and internet skill (weakly correlated with activity level) may create more savvy consumers; and (3) we confirm previous findings about the gender effect in spam consumption, but find this effect largely corresponds to spam topics. our findings provide practical insights to reduce demand for spam content, thereby affecting spam profitability.","first, website familiarity might have played a role since japanese websites have previously been found to differ from us american websites.","adapting the visual designs of websites to a local target audience can be beneficial, because such design localization increases users' appeal, trust, and work efficiency. yet designers often find it difficult to decide when to adapt and how to adapt the designs, mainly because there are currently no guidelines that describe common website designs in various countries. we contribute the first large-scale analysis of 80,901 website designs across 44 countries, made available via an interactive web-based design catalog. using computational image metrics to compare the ~2,000 most visited websites per country, we found significant differences between several design aspects, such as a website's colorfulness, visual complexity, the number of text areas and the average saturation of colors. our results contribute a snapshot of web designs that users in 44 countries frequently see, showing that the design of websites with a global reach are more homogenized compared to local websites between countries.",210.0,335.0,22076.0
"we explore a new approach to programming swarm user interfaces (swarm ui) by leveraging direct physical manipulation. existing swarm ui applications are written using a robot programming framework: users work on a computer screen and think in terms of low-level controls. in contrast, our approach allows programmers to work in physical space by directly manipulating objects and think in terms of high-level interface design. inspired by current ui programming practices, we introduce a four-step workflow-create elements, abstract attributes, specify behaviors, and propagate changes-for swarm ui programming. we propose a set of direct physical manipulation techniques to support each step in this workflow. to demonstrate these concepts, we developed reactile, a swarm ui programming environment that actuates a swarm of small magnets and displays spatial information of program states using a dlp projector. two user studies-an in-class survey with 148 students and a lab interview with eight participants-confirm that our approach is intuitive and understandable for programming swarm uis.","despite the similarities in inductively generated codes between our high school students and kou and gui's general population of league players, we note all student participants were in high school, and children differ from adults in emotional response and regulation.","streakiness refers to observed tendency towards consecutive appearances of particular patterns. in video games, streakiness is oftentimes inevitable, where a player keeps winning or losing for a short period. however, the phenomenon remains understudied in present online game research. how do players perceive streakiness? how does it impact player experience (px)? how should streakiness be taken into consideration for the design of px? in this paper, we address these questions through a qualitative study of player discussions about streakiness in league of legends. we found that players developed various ways to describe a streak. both winning and losing streaks negatively impacted px. players devised numerous strategies to manage streakiness, among which disengagement was a primary means. we analyze streakiness as a social construct through which players coped with complex game systems. we discuss design implications for managing streakiness in online games.",197.0,575.0,19147.0

"while mobile instant messaging (mim) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. we examine two design concepts for mim-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. we built mybutler, an android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with kakaotalk, a commercial mim app. during a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. we reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in mim communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of mim users in choosing whether to alert their messages. in terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. we found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations.","self-tracking is then seen as a possible way to directly control individuals’ fertility trajectories, a belief that is largely influenced by societal views of healthcare (e.g., one needs to take responsibility for their health) and expectations about gender (e.g., women are responsible for conceiving).","self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. we explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. we qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. we found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. we discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. we also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area.",918.0,807.0,11921.0

"the electrocardiogram (ecg) is commonly used to detect arrhythmias. traditionally, a single ecg observation is used for diagnosis, making it difficult to detect irregular arrhythmias. recent technology developments, however, have made it cost-effective to collect large amounts of raw ecg data over time. this promises to improve diagnosis accuracy, but the large data volume presents new challenges for cardiologists. this paper introduces ecglens, an interactive system for arrhythmia detection and analysis using large-scale ecg data. our system integrates an automatic heartbeat classification algorithm based on convolutional neural network, an outlier detection algorithm, and a set of rich interaction techniques. we also introduce a-glyph, a novel glyph designed to improve the readability and comparison of ecg signals. we report results from a comprehensive user study showing that a-glyph improves the efficiency in arrhythmia detection, and demonstrate the effectiveness of ecglens in arrhythmia detection through two expert interviews.","more recent explorations on the role of design within the field include critical reflections on the notion of research contribution in hci, by research conducted through non-deterministic design practices.","notions of what counts as a contribution to hci continue to be contested as our field expands to accommodate perspectives from the arts and humanities. this paper aims to advance the position of the arts and further contribute to these debates by actively exploring what a ""non-contribution"" would look like in hci. we do this by taking inspiration from fluxus, a collective of artists in the 1950's and 1960's who actively challenged and reworked practices of fine arts institutions by producing radically accessible, ephemeral, and modest works of ""art-amusement."" we use fluxus to develop three analogous forms of ""hci-amusements,"" each of which shed light on dominant practices and values within hci by resisting to fit into its logics.",660.0,699.0,38365.0
"k-8 mathematics students must learn many procedures, such as addition and subtraction. students frequently learn ""buggy' variations of these procedures, which we ideally could identify automatically. this is challenging because there are many possible variations that reflect deep compositions of procedural thought. existing approaches for k-8 math use manually specified variations which do not scale to new math algorithms or previously unseen misconceptions. our system examines students' answers and infers how they incorrectly combine basic skills into complex procedures. we evaluate this approach on data from approximately 300 students. our system replicates 86% of the answers that contain clear systematic mistakes (13%). investigating further, we found 77% at least partially replicate a known misconception, with 53% matching exactly. we also present data from 29 participants showing that our system can demonstrate inferred incorrect procedures to an educator as successfully as a human expert.","therefore, a large body of work in the vr field has focused on conveying as much tangible information as possible from the real to the virtual world leading to more immersive experiences – for instance, rendering objects properties such as size, shape, texture, and weight.","humans can estimate the shape of a wielded object through the illusory feeling of the mass properties of the object obtained using their hands. even though the shape of hand-held objects influences immersion and realism in virtual reality (vr), it is difficult to design vr controllers for rendering desired shapes according to the perceptions derived from the illusory effects of mass properties and shape perception. we propose transcalibur, which is a hand-held vr controller that can render a 2d shape by changing its mass properties on a 2d planar area. we built a computational perception model using a data-driven approach from the collected data pairs of mass properties and perceived shapes. this enables transcalibur to easily and effectively provide convincing shape perception based on complex illusory effects. our user study showed that the system succeeded in providing the perception of various desired shapes in a virtual environment.",262.0,675.0,12856.0
"most studies of executive function (ef) in autism spectrum disorder (asd) focus on cognitive information processing, emphasizing less the social interaction deficits core to asd. we designed a mobile game that uses social and nonsocial stimuli to assess children's ef skills. the game comprised three components involving different ef skills: cognitive flexibility (shifting/inference), inhibitory control, and short-term memory. by recruiting 65 children with and without asd to play the mobile game, we investigated the potential of such platforms for capturing important phenotypic characteristics of individuals with autism. results highlighted between-diagnostic-group differences in playing patterns with children with asd showing broad patterns of ef deficits, but with relative strengths in nonsocial short-term memory, and preserved response to emotional inhibition cues. we showed the system could predict iq, an important target for clinical treatment, towards the goal of developing platforms to act as long-term, efficient, and effective behavioral biomarkers for asd.","only until recently have researchers began to conduct controlled lab studies to rigorously evaluate popular xai techniques, as well as studies to understand real-world user needs for ai explainability.","as the use of machine learning (ml) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. while scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like hci, ml, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. this lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. to bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ml models. the characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. we present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.",440.0,952.0,4587.0
"biosensing displays, increasingly enrolled in emotional reflection, promise authoritative insight by presenting users' emotions as discrete categories. rather than machines interpreting emotions, we sought to explore an alternative with emotional biosensing displays in which users formed their own interpretations and felt comfortable critiquing the display. so, we designed, implemented, and deployed, as a technology probe, an emotional biosensory display: ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes color responding to the wearer's skin conductance, which is associated with excitement. 17 participants wore ripple over 2 days of daily life. while some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' ripple provided between body and emotion, for others ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had. despite our design intentions, we found participants rarely questioned the display's relation to their feelings. using biopolitics to speculate on ripple's surprising authority, we highlight ethical stakes of biosensory representations for sense of self and ways of feeling.","to connect the designer's pcb with testing hardware, simpoint extends strasnick et al.’s approach to automated pcb instrumentation.","difficulties in accessing, isolating, and iterating on the components and connections of a printed circuit board (pcb) create unique challenges in pcb debugging. manual probing methods are slow and error prone, and even dedicated pcb testing equipment remains limited by its inability to modify the circuit during testing. we present pinpoint, a tool that facilitates in-circuit pcb debugging through techniques such as programmatically probing signals, dynamically disconnecting components and subcircuits to test in isolation, and splicing in new elements to explore potential modifications. pinpoint automatically instruments a pcb design and generates designs for a physical jig board that interfaces the user's pcb to our custom testing hardware and to software tools. we evaluate pinpoint's ability to facilitate the debugging of various pcb issues by instrumenting and testing different classes of boards, as well as by characterizing its technical limitations and by soliciting feedback through a guided exploration with pcb designers.",428.0,712.0,40880.0
"conversational programmers represent a class of learners who are not required to write any code, yet try to learn programming to improve their participation in technical conversations. we carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. however, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. our findings point to design opportunities in hci to invent learner-centered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations.","first, computational systems cannot classify content in as nuanced a way as human cognitive capabilities—which is why there are human moderators.13 for instance, people's definitions of “disturbing pictures” are likely to be different in varying degrees.","when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.",508.0,882.0,24634.0

"to investigate preferences for mobile and wearable sound awareness systems, we conducted an online survey with 201 dhh participants. the survey explores how demographic factors affect perceptions of sound awareness technologies, gauges interest in specific sounds and sound characteristics, solicits reactions to three design scenarios (smartphone, smartwatch, head-mounted display) and two output modalities (visual, haptic), and probes issues related to social context of use. while most participants were highly interested in being aware of sounds, this interest was modulated by communication preference--that is, for sign or oral communication or both. almost all participants wanted both visual and haptic feedback and 75% preferred to have that feedback on separate devices (e.g., haptic on smartwatch, visual on head-mounted display). other findings related to sound type, full captions vs. keywords, sound filtering, notification styles, and social context provide direct guidance for the design of future mobile and wearable sound awareness systems.","for example, project zanzibar combines mutual and self-capacitive sensing to detect touch and hand gestures, and also used nfc tagging to detect objects.","we present project zanzibar: a flexible mat that can locate, uniquely identify and communicate with tangible objects placed on its surface, as well as sense a user's touch and hover hand gestures. we describe the underlying technical contributions: efficient and localised near field communication (nfc) over a large surface area; object tracking combining nfc signal strength and capacitive footprint detection, and manufacturing techniques for a rollable device form-factor that enables portability, while providing a sizable interaction area when unrolled. in addition, we detail design patterns for tangibles of varying complexity and interactive capabilities, including the ability to sense orientation on the mat, harvest power, provide additional input and output, stack, or extend sensing outside the bounds of the mat. capabilities and interaction modalities are illustrated with self-generated applications. finally, we report on the experience of professional game developers building novel physical/digital experiences using the platform.",710.0,512.0,179.0
"families preserve memories of their special and everyday experiences, though it can be hard to capture all these moments in everyday life. we explore the concept of automated forms of capturing family life and presenting them through situated, tangible everyday artifacts in the home. we designed time-turner, an always-on video recording system along with a set of three drink coasters that allow family members to easily search, filter and replay videos to connect to their past. we engaged households in speculative enactments and interviews to explore the design space. our findings point to the value of witnessing real rather than staged moments and the ways in which the affordances of everyday artifacts can allow media to be 'lived with' as a part of everyday life. yet our design also revealed tensions around sharing and changing perceptions across time and generations. this points to design challenges around safeguarding this media and capturing 'reality' as opposed to curated content.","closely related is nebeling and colleagues's protoar, a tool aimed for non-expert users that integrates ar views to prototype ar experiences with a desktop pc.","the latest generations of smartphones with built-in ar capabilities enable a new class of mobile apps that merge digital and real-world content depending on a user's task, context, and preference. but even experienced mobile app designers face significant challenges: creating 2d/3d ar content remains difficult and time-consuming, and current mobile prototyping tools do not support ar views. there are separate tools for this; however, they require significant technical skill. this paper presents protoar which supplements rapid physical prototyping using paper and play-doh with new mobile cross-device multi-layer authoring and interactive capture tools to generate mobile screens and ar overlays from paper sketches, and quasi-3d content from 360-degree captures of clay models. we describe how protoar evolved over four design jams with students to enable interactive prototypes of mobile ar apps in less than 90 minutes, and discuss the advantages and insights protoar can give designers.",177.0,351.0,22097.0
"web user interfaces today leverage many common gui design patterns, including navigation bars and menus (hierarchical structure), tabular content presentation, and scrolling. these visual-spatial cues enhance the interaction experience of sighted users. however, the linear nature of screen translation tools currently available to blind users make it difficult to understand or navigate these structures. we introduce spatial region interaction techniques (sprites) for nonvisual access: a novel method for navigating two-dimensional structures using the keyboard surface. sprites 1) preserve spatial layout, 2) enable bimanual interaction, and 3) improve the end user experience. we used a series of design probes to explore different methods for keyboard surface interaction. our evaluation of sprites shows that three times as many participants were able to complete spatial tasks with sprites than with their preferred current technology.","for instance, arrows can be used to represent trajectories or motion paths using a plain line-style on a surface or dotted line in mid-air.","many recent studies have explored user-defined interactions for touch and gesture-based systems through end-user elicitation. while these studies have facilitated the user-end of the human-computer dialogue, the subsequent design of gesture representations to communicate gestures to the user vary in style and consistency. our study explores how users interpret, enact, and refine gesture representations adapting techniques from recent elicitation studies. to inform our study design, we analyzed gesture representations from 30 elicitation papers and developed a taxonomy of design elements. we then conducted a partnered elicitation study with 30 participants producing 657 gesture representations accompanied by think-aloud data. we discuss design patterns and themes that emerged from our analysis, and supplement these findings with an in-depth look at users' mental models when perceiving and enacting gesture representations. finally, based on the results, we provide recommendations for practitioners in need of ""visual language"" guidelines to communicate possible user actions.",10.0,544.0,11023.0
"paper-based fabrication techniques offer powerful opportunities to prototype new technological interfaces. typically, paper-based interfaces are either static mockups or require integration with sensors to provide real-time interactivity. the latter can be challenging and expensive, requiring knowledge of electronics, programming, and sensing. but what if computer vision could be combined with prototyping domain-aware programming tools to support the rapid construction of interactive, paper-based tangible interfaces? we designed a toolkit called arcadia that allows for rapid, low-cost prototyping of tuis that only requires access to a webcam, a web browser, and paper. arcadia brings paper prototypes to life through the use of marker based augmented reality (ar). users create mappings between real-world tangible objects and different ui elements. after a crafting and programming phase, all subsequent interactions take place with the tangible objects. we evaluated arcadia in a workshop with 120 teenage girls and found that tangible ar technologies can empower novice technology designers to rapidly construct and iterate on their ideas.",the concept of using blocks as a method of making for individuals is not limited to the physical environment.,"blocks-based programming environments are a popular tool to teach children to program, but they rely heavily on visual metaphors and are therefore not fully accessible for children with visual impairments. we evaluated existing blocks-based environments and identified five major accessibility barriers for visually impaired users. we explored techniques to overcome these barriers in an interview with a teacher of the visually impaired and formative studies on a touchscreen blocks-based environment with five children with visual impairments. we distill our findings on usable touchscreen interactions into guidelines for designers of blocks-based environments.",407.0,68.0,16813.0

"this paper presents a designerly exploration of the potential values of parent-tracked baby data in interactions between parents and healthcare professionals (hcps). where previous work has used parent-tracked data as part of the solution to a problem, we contribute by starting our design exploration from data, using it as creative material in our design process. as we intend to work towards a system that could be viable across different levels of care, we invited three different types of hcps and five families with newborns, for a five-week situated design exploration. facilitated by an open and dynamic data collection toolkit, parents and hcps could together decide what data to collect. in a continuous dialogue, they reflected on the relevance of that data in their interaction. based on this, we continuously and remotely developed two concepts.","we used in-vr questionnaires to ensure a consistent vr experience and not break participants’ focus, doing so also makes the methodology more applicable to potential future studies running fully remotely.","questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (vr) evaluations and user studies. however, transitioning from virtual worlds to the physical world to respond to vr experience questionnaires can potentially lead to systematic biases. administering questionnaires in vr (invrqs) is becoming more common in contemporary research. this is based on the intuitive notion that invrqs may ease participation, reduce the break in presence (bip) and avoid biases. in this paper, we perform a systematic investigation into the effects of interrupting the vr experience through questionnaires using physiological data as a continuous and objective measure of presence. in a user study (n=50), we evaluated question-asking procedures using a vr shooter with two different levels of immersion. the users rated their player experience with a questionnaire either inside or outside of vr. our results indicate a reduced bip for the employed invrq without affecting the self-reported player experience.",295.0,741.0,32197.0
"emotional biosensing is rising in daily life: data and categories claim to know how people feel and suggest what they should do about it, while cscw explores new biosensing possibilities. prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. we contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. in particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. we call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, 'the good life,' and everyday experience.","although a growing body of research has successfully applied game design to various disciplines (e.g., health, education, human computation among others) to foster motivation and sustained engagement, player behaviour cannot be predicted solely from motivation, affective computing, or cognitive modeling, as games are a dynamic and ergodic media, i.e., a player interacts with them and alters their state.","preparing for exams is an important yet stressful time for many students. self-testing is known to be an effective preparation strategy, yet some students lack motivation to engage or persist in self-testing activities. adding game elements to a platform supporting self-testing may increase engagement and, by extension, exam performance. we conduct a randomized controlled experiment (n=701) comparing the effect of two game elements -- a points system and a badge system -- used individually and in combination. we find that the badge system elicits significantly higher levels of voluntary self-testing activity and this effect is particularly pronounced amongst a relatively small cohort. importantly, this increased activity translates to a significant improvement in exam scores. our data supports a causal relationship between gamification and learning outcomes, mediated by self-testing behavior. this provides empirical support for landers' theory of gamified learning when the gamified activity is conducted prior to measuring learning outcomes.",836.0,309.0,6468.0
"graphical displays are a typical means for conveying awareness information in groupware systems to help users track joint activities, but are not ideal when vision is constrained. understanding how people maintain awareness through non-visual means is crucial for designing effective alternatives for supporting awareness in such situations. we present a lab study simulating an extreme scenario where 32 pairs of participants use an audio-only tool to edit shared audio menus. our aim is to characterise collaboration in this audio-only space in order to identify whether and how, by itself, audio can mediate collaboration. our findings show that the means for audio delivery and choice of working styles in this space influence types and patterns of awareness information exchange. we thus highlight the need to accommodate different working styles when designing audio support for awareness, and extend previous research by identifying types of awareness information to convey in response to group work dynamics.","this study is different from chen et al.’s study with small graphs (≤ 15 nodes, ≤ 36 links).","we investigate visualisations of networks on a 2-dimensional torus topology, like an opened-up and flattened doughnut. that is, the network is drawn on a rectangular area while ""wrapping"" specific links around the border. previous work on torus drawings of networks has been mostly theoretical, limited to certain classes of networks, and not evaluated by human readability studies. we offer a simple interactive layout approach applicable to general graphs. we use this to find layouts affording better aesthetics in terms of conventional measures like more equal edge length and fewer crossings. in two controlled user studies we find that torus layout with either additional context or interactive panning provided significant performance improvement (in terms of error and time) over torus layout without either of these improvements, to the point that it is comparable to standard non-torus layout.",543.0,777.0,28349.0

"for modern data analytics, practices from software development are increasingly necessary to manage data, but they must be incorporated alongside other statistical and scientific skills. therefore, we ask: how does a community recontextualize software development through the unique pressures of their work? to answer this, we explore the analytic community around baseball, or sabermetrics. to discover software development's place in the search for robust statistical insight in sports, we interview 10 participants in the sabermetric community and survey over 120 more data analysts, both in baseball and not. we explore how their work lives at the intersection of science and entertainment, and as a consequence, baseball data serves as an accessible yet deep subject to practice analytic skills. software development exists within an iterative research process that cycles between defining rigorous statistical methods and preserving the flexibility to chase interesting problems. in this question-driven process, members of the community inhabit several overlapping roles of intentional work, in which software development can become the priority to support research and statistical infrastructure, and we discuss the way that the community can foster the balance of these skills.","machine learning models also influence people's decisions about what news articles to read, what movies to watch, what music to listen to, what clothes to buy, and even who to date.","algorithms influence most of our daily activities, decisions, and they guide our behaviors. it has been argued that algorithms even have a direct impact on democratic societies. human - computer interaction research needs to develop analytical tools for describing the interaction with, and experience of algorithms. based on user participatory workshops focused on scrutinizing facebook's newsfeed, an algorithm-influenced social media, we propose the concept of algorithmic experience (ax) as an analytic framing for making the interaction with and experience of algorithms explicit. connecting it to design, we articulate five functional categories of ax that are particularly important to cater for in social media: profiling transparency and management, algorithmic awareness and control, and selective algorithmic memory.",936.0,284.0,13996.0

"studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. this skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. for example, kay et al. showed that although 28% of ceos in the u.s. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for ""ceo"" in google image search are women. similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. these labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. however, such labels are often unknown. further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. as observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. we develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. the goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. it accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this ""diversity score"" into the final selection process. importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. we provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known mmr algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. we evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 google image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known celeba dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as ""smiling"" or ""glasses"". both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current google image search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. these empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search.",data comics have been shown to be very effective at communicating information.,"data comics for data-driven storytelling are inspired by the visual language of comics and aim to communicate insights in data through visualizations. while comics are widely known, few examples of data comics exist and there has not been any structured analysis nor guidance for their creation. we introduce data-comic design-patterns, each describing a set of panels with a specific narrative purpose, that allow for rapid storyboarding of data comics while showcasing their expressive potential. our patterns are derived from i) analyzing common patterns in infographics, datavideos, and existing data comics, ii) our experiences creating data comics for different scenarios. our patterns demonstrate how data comics allow an author to combine the best of both worlds: spatial layout and overview from infographics as well as linearity and narration from videos and presentations.",1004.0,37.0,44521.0
"in romantic relationships, instant messaging (im) can serve as a communication channel to maintain a sense of mutual presence and relational closeness when being physically separated. however, im is asynchronous by design. there can exist time delay for people to receive and reply to incoming messages, which may violate romantic partner's mutual expectation. limited understanding is available around how unintended and intended delays affect the relationship of romantic partners. this work examines how romantic partners grow, perceive, and use mutual knowledge about each other in delayed im to resolve the expectancy violation. we conducted a 7-day diary study on 16 pairs of romantic couples and used the diary entries as probes for post-study one-on-one interviews. our findings show that couples employ different strategies of information grounding to parse and resolve delayed im. based on these findings, we propose several theoretical and practical implications.","wakkary et al summarize their counterfactual approach as follows: “a counterfactual artifact is a fully realized functioning product or system that intentionally contradicts what would normally be considered logical to create given the norms of design and design products, like a tilting bowl.” this counterfactual “countering of norms” opens “the possibilities to empirically investigate multiple alternative existences (or what-ifs) as lived-with realities of the counterfactual artifacts”:1.","this paper reports on a postphenomenological inquiry of six trained philosophers, who as study participants lived with and reflected on a research product we designed known as the tilting bowl: a ceramic bowl that unpredictably but gently tilts multiple times daily. the tilting bowl is a counterfactual artifact that is designed specifically for this study as part of a material speculation approach to design research. a postphenomenological inquiry looks to describe and analyze accounts of relationships between humans and technological artifacts, and how each mutually shapes the other through mediations that form the human subjectivity and objectivity of any given situation. this paper contributes an empirical account and analysis of the relations that emerged (background and alterity) and the relativistic views that co-constitute the philosophers, tilting bowl, and their specific worlds. the findings demonstrate the relevance of this philosophical framing to fundamentally and broadly understand how people engage digital artifacts.",100.0,93.0,37970.0
"venezuela is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. in addition to food and medicinal shortages, violent crime has risen dramatically since 2014, spurring a mass exodus from the country. in order to cope with persistent material, informational, and digital infrastructural breakdowns that their friends and family in venezuela are facing, members of the venezuelan diaspora have turned to social media platforms to support people they left behind. through semi-structured interviews and participant observation, i uncover the ways participants form a critical infrastructure for people in venezuela. i describe participants' actions as infrastructural care --- infrastructural action as a form of caring for others at a distance through the ongoing management of resources, relationships, and infrastructures. infrastructural care consists of relational, negotiated, and dialectic actions that provide critical support while also generating ongoing tensions as participants are geographically separated from the crisis and, through their involvement, are forced to confront their own experiences of trauma. in addition to proposing the lens of infrastructural care, this paper contributes to our understandings of the ways people cope with an ongoing humanitarian crisis at a distance and how social media platforms fit in with wider ecologies of efforts.","to demonstrate this, we implemented a simple mr furniture editor inspired by.","we present remixed reality, a novel form of mixed reality. in contrast to classical mixed reality approaches where users see a direct view or video feed of their environment, with remixed reality they see a live 3d reconstruction, gathered from multiple external depth cameras. this approach enables changing the environment as easily as geometry can be changed in virtual reality, while allowing users to view and interact with the actual physical world as they would in augmented reality. we characterize a taxonomy of manipulations that are possible with remixed reality: spatial changes such as erasing objects; appearance changes such as changing textures; temporal changes such as pausing time; and viewpoint changes that allow users to see the world from different points without changing their physical location. we contribute a method that uses an underlying voxel grid holding information like visibility and transformations, which is applied to live geometry in real time.",1053.0,128.0,45047.0

"older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. to date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. to do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security.","interactions with audio are generally understudied in hci, though there has been a recent surge of interest in designing interactions with calls of the wild.","we introduce the ambient birdhouse, a novel iot design for the home that seeks to encourage awareness and discovery of birds outside. people increasingly have routines and technologies that disconnect them from nature. moreover birds are hard to come to know, seen but not heard, heard but not seen, or simply around when we are not. the ambient birdhouse aims to reconcile these positions, by using local bird media to leverage people's playfulness and curiosity, calmly sustain interest over time and ultimately to garner interest and engagement in nature and conservation projects. we trialled the ambient birdhouse with five families. key findings are that the playful nature of the birdhouse has an immediate grasp on children, and through them on the rest of the family. children were prompt to learn bird calls, and invented and played games that involved the birdhouse. learning strategies emerged spontaneously from family routines and arrangements, with each family creating different moments and spaces for learning.",1061.0,395.0,34848.0

"despite their pervasiveness, current text-based conversational agents (chatbots) are predominantly monolingual, while users are often multilingual. it is well-known that multilingual users mix languages while interacting with others, as well as in their interactions with computer systems (such as query formulation in text-/voice-based search interfaces and digital assistants). linguists refer to this phenomenon as code-mixing or code-switching. do multilingual users also prefer chatbots that can respond in a code-mixed language over those which cannot? in order to inform the design of chatbots for multilingual users, we conduct a mixed-method user-study (n=91) where we examine how conversational agents, that code-mix and reciprocate the users' mixing choices over multiple conversation turns, are evaluated and perceived by bilingual users. we design a human-in-the-loop chatbot with two different code-mixing policies -- (a) always code-mix irrespective of user behavior, and (b) nudge with subtle code-mixed cues and reciprocate only if the user, in turn, code-mixes. these two are contrasted with a monolingual chatbot that never code-mixed. users are asked to interact with the bots, and provide ratings on perceived naturalness and personal preference. they are also asked open-ended questions around what they (dis)liked about the bots. analysis of the chat logs, users' ratings, and qualitative responses reveal that multilingual users strongly prefer chatbots that can code-mix. we find that self-reported language proficiency is the strongest predictor of user preferences. compared to the always code-mix policy, nudging emerges as a low-risk low-gain policy which is equally acceptable to all users. nudging as a policy is further supported by the observation that users who rate the code-mixing bot higher typically tend to reciprocate the language mixing pattern of the bot. these findings present a first step towards developing conversational systems that are more human-like and engaging by virtue of adapting to the users' linguistic style.","some other works leverage actuators, including motors, propellers, electrical muscle stimulation (ems) and vibrotactile actuators, to simulate tactile feedback or generate tactile illusions with various degrees of stiffness and/or roughness.","claw is a handheld virtual reality controller that augments the typical controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. our controller enables three distinct interactions (grasping virtual object, touching virtual surfaces, and triggering) and changes its corresponding haptic rendering by sensing the differences in the user's grasp. a servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement. claw also supports a haptic force feedback in the trigger mode when the user holds a gun. we describe the design considerations for claw and evaluate its performance through two user studies. the first study obtained qualitative user feedback on the naturalness, effectiveness, and comfort when using the device. the second study investigated the ease of the transition between grasping and touching when using our device.",925.0,651.0,7550.0

"how can instructors group students into teams that interact and learn effectively together? one strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with ""good"" compositions such as skill diversity. another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. our work synthesizes these two strands of research. we describe an experiment (n=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. in two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. we collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. we also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. we distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments.","these issues can represent a special type of ‘data leakage’, where data becomes visible to an unethical actor through technological intrusion, but this is data leakage within the context of a home and a relationship, and as such have not been accounted for in the design of these technologies.","through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions.",835.0,709.0,19930.0
"online donation platforms help equalize access to opportunity and funding in cases where inequalities exist. in the context of public school education in the united states, for instance, financial inequalities have been shown to be reflected in the educational system, since schools are primarily funded through local property taxes. in response, private charitable donation platforms such as donorschoose.org have emerged seeking to alleviate systemic inequalities. yet, the question remains of how effective these platforms are in redressing existing funding inequalities across school districts. our analysis of donation data from donorschoose shows that such platforms may in fact be ineffective in mitigating existing inequalities or may even exacerbate them. in this paper, we explore how online educational charities could direct more funding towards more impoverished schools without compromising their donors' freedom of choice with respect to donation targets. seeking to answer this question, we draw on the line of work on choice architectures in behavioral economics and pose a novel research question on the impact of interface design on equity in socio-technical systems. through controlled experiments, we demonstrate how simple interface design interventions - such as modifying default rankings or displaying additional information about schools - might lead to changes in donation distributions helping platforms direct more funding towards schools in need. going beyond online educational charities, we hope that our work will bring attention to the role of interface design nudges in the social requirements of online altruism.",there is evidence that the context of the image may affect the user choice.,"visual attention, search, processing and comprehension are important cognitive tasks during a graphical password composition activity. aiming to shed light on whether individual differences on visual behavior affect the strength of the created passwords, we conducted an eye-tracking study (n=36), and adopted an accredited cognitive style theory to interpret the results. the analysis revealed that users with different cognitive styles followed different patterns of visual behavior which affected the strength of the created passwords. motivated, by the results of the first study, we introduced adaptive characteristics to the user authentication mechanism, aiming to assist specific cognitive style user groups to create more secure passwords, and conducted a second study with a new sample (n=40) to test the adaptive characteristics. results strengthen our assumptions that adaptive mechanisms based on users' differences in cognitive and visual behavior uncover a new perspective for improving the password's strength within graphical user authentication realms.",991.0,86.0,6442.0

"as humans, we have the natural capability of localizing the origin of sounds. spatial audio rendering leverages this skill by applying special filters to recorded audio to create the impression that a sound emanates from a certain position in the physical space. a main application for spatial audio on mobile devices is to provide non-visual navigation cues. current systems require users to either listen to artificial beacon sounds, or the entire audio source (e.g., a song) is repositioned in space, which impacts the listening experience. we present navigatone, a system that takes advantage of multi-track recordings and provides directional cues by moving a single track in the auditory space. while minimizing the impact of the navigation component on the listening experience, a user study showed that participants could localize sources as good as with stereo panning while the listening experience was rated to be closer to common music listening.","prior work also investigated other aspects of remote work, such as management of workers, organizational design, communication challenges, team performance, well-being, and emerging roles and experience.","social e-commerce, as a new form of social computing based marketing platforms, utilizes existing real-world social relationships for promotions and sales of products. it has been growing rapidly in recent years and attracted tens of millions of users in china. a key group of actors who enable market transactions on these platforms are intermediaries who connect producers with consumers by sharing information with and recommending products to their real-world social contacts. despite their crucial role, the nature and behavior of these intermediaries on these social e-commerce platforms has not been systematically analyzed. here we address this knowledge gap through a mixed method study. leveraging 9 months' all-round behavior of about 40 million users on beidian -- one of the largest social e-commerce sites in china, alongside with qualitative evidence from online forums and interviews, we examine characteristics of intermediaries, identify their behavioral patterns and uncover strategies and mechanisms that make successful intermediaries. we demonstrate that intermediaries on social e-commerce sites act as local trend detectors and ""social grocers''. furthermore, successful intermediaries are highly dedicated whenever best sellers appear and broaden items for promotion. to the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis on the emerging role of intermediaries in social e-commerce platforms, which provides potential insights for the design and management of social computing marketing platforms.",634.0,979.0,27177.0
"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.","however, helping children – and their parents – better understand privacy implications of using an app should be in a company's interest so as to facilitate trust in the app's privacy protections, reduce customer surprise, and avoid media outcries.","news coverage of security and privacy (s&p) events is pervasive and may affect the salience of s&p threats to the public. to better understand this coverage and its effects, we asked: what types of s&p news come into people's awareness? how do people hear about and share this news? over two years, we recruited 1999 participants to fill out a survey on emergent s&p news events. we identified four types of s&p news: financial data breaches, corporate personal data breaches, high sensitivity systems breaches, and politicized / activist cybersecurity. these event types strongly correlated with how people shared s&p news-e.g., financial data breaches were shared most (42%), while politicized / activist cybersecurity events were shared least (21%). furthermore, participants' age, gender and security behavioral intention strongly correlated with how they heard about and shared s&p news-e.g., males more often felt a personal responsibility to share, and older people were less likely to hear about s&p news through conversation.",997.0,0.0,41860.0

"people with health concerns go to online health support groups to obtain help and advice. to do so, they frequently disclose personal details, many times in public. although research in non-health settings suggests that people self-disclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. by automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale, we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. although one's self-disclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. these channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. we discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work.","in recent years, live streaming has received increasing attention from the hci community.","despite gaining traction in north america, live streaming has not reached the popularity it has in china, where live- streaming has a tremendous impact on the social behaviors of users. to better understand this socio-technological phenomenon, we conducted a mixed methods study of live streaming practices in china. we present the results of an online survey of 527 live streaming users, focusing on their broadcasting or viewing practices and the experiences they find most engaging. we also interviewed 14 active users to explore their motivations and experiences. our data revealed the different categories of content that was broadcasted and how varying aspects of this content engaged viewers. we also gained insight into the role reward systems and fan group-chat play in engaging users, while also finding evidence that both viewers and streamers desire deeper channels and mechanisms for interaction in addition to the commenting, gifting, and fan groups that are available today.",695.0,463.0,19720.0

"interface designs on both small and large displays can encourage people to alter their physical distance to the display. mobile devices support this form of interaction naturally, as the user can move the device closer or further away as needed. the current generation of mobile devices can employ computer vision, depth sensing and other inference methods to determine the distance between the user and the display. once this distance is known, a system can adapt the rendering of display content accordingly and enable proximity-aware mobile interfaces. the dominant method of exploiting proximity-aware interfaces is to remove or superimpose visual information. in this paper, we investigate change blindness in such interfaces. we present the results of two experiments. in our first experiment we show that a proximity-aware mobile interface results in significantly more change blindness errors than a non-moving interface. the absolute difference in error rates was 13.7%. in our second experiment we show that within a proximity-aware mobile interface, gradual changes induce significantly more change blindness errors than instant changes---confirming expected change blindness behavior. based on our results we discuss the implications of either exploiting change blindness effects or mitigating them when designing mobile proximity-aware interfaces.",researchers have proposed many techniques to facilitate pointing-based target selection.,"in contrast to the extensive studies on static target pointing, much less formal understanding of moving target acquisition can be found in the hci literature. we designed a set of experiments to identify regularities in 1d unidirectional moving target selection, and found a ternary-gaussian model to be descriptive of the endpoint distribution in such tasks. the shape of the distribution as characterized by μ and σ in the gaussian model were primarily determined by the speed and size of the moving target. the model fits the empirical data well with 0.95 and 0.94 r2 values for μ and σ , respectively. we also demonstrated two extensions of the model, including 1) predicting error rates in moving target selection; and 2) a novel interaction technique to implicitly aid moving target selection. by applying them in a game interface design, we observed good performances in both predicting error rates (e.g., 2.7% mean absolute error) and assisting moving target selection (e.g., 33% or a greater increase in pointing accuracy).",42.0,235.0,11242.0

"room-scale virtual reality (vr) has become an affordable consumer reality, with applications ranging from entertainment to productivity. however, the limited physical space available for room-scale vr in the typical home or office environment poses a significant problem. to solve this, physical spaces can be extended by amplifying the mapping of physical to virtual movement (translational gain). although amplified movement has been used since the earliest days of vr, little is known about how it influences reach-based interactions with virtual objects, now a standard feature of consumer vr. consequently, this paper explores the picking and placing of virtual objects in vr for the first time, with translational gains of between 1x (a one-to-one mapping of a 3.5m*3.5m virtual space to the same sized physical space) and 3x (10.5m*10.5m virtual mapped to 3.5m*3.5m physical). results show that reaching accuracy is maintained for up to 2x gain, however going beyond this diminishes accuracy and increases simulator sickness and perceived workload. we suggest gain levels of 1.5x to 1.75x can be utilized without compromising the usability of a vr task, significantly expanding the bounds of interactive room-scale vr.","together with its follow-up projects, various factors such as visual feedback on touched keys, keyboard size, word-delimiter actions (e.g.","entering text on non-desktop computing devices is often done via an onscreen virtual keyboard. input on such keyboards normally consists of a sequence of noisy tap events that specify some amount of text, most commonly a single word. but is single word-at-a-time entry the best choice? this paper compares user performance and recognition accuracy of word-at-a-time, phrase-at-a-time, and sentence-at-a-time text entry on a smartwatch keyboard. we evaluate the impact of differing amounts of input in both text copy and free composition tasks. we found providing input of an entire sentence significantly improved entry rates from 26 wpm to 32 wpm while keeping character error rates below 4%. in offline experiments with more processing power and memory, sentence input was recognized with a much lower 2.0% error rate. our findings suggest virtual keyboards can enhance performance by encouraging users to provide more input per recognition event.",98.0,623.0,11503.0

"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.",[18]) and spatially-aware smartphones (e.g.,"immersive technologies such as augmented reality devices are opening up a new design space for the visual analysis of data. this paper studies the potential of an augmented reality environment for the purpose of collaborative analysis of multidimensional, abstract data. we present art, a collaborative analysis tool to visualize multidimensional data in augmented reality using an interactive, 3d parallel coordinates visualization. the visualization is anchored to a touch-sensitive tabletop, benefiting from well-established interaction techniques. the results of group-based, expert walkthroughs show that art can facilitate immersion in the data, a fluid analysis process, and collaboration. based on the results, we provide a set of guidelines and discuss future research areas to foster the development of immersive technologies as tools for the collaborative analysis of multidimensional data.",882.0,89.0,28541.0

"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.","both individual and community notions of identity are constructed through how people self-present online, online discourse, culture, and practice (e.g., asian american and pacific islander (aapi) identity work as deliberation, black twitter, queer visibility and self-presentation, and re-conceptualizing socialization for autistic children in minecraft).","lgbt+ people adjust the presentation of their gender and sexual identities in response to social pressures, but their level of visibility differs between social media. we interviewed seventeen lgbt+ students at a socially-conservative university to investigate: (1) how do social media affect lgbt+ user experience of managing self presentation; and (2) how do social media affect participation in lgbt+ communities? we develop implications for design to support queering social media.

"successful human interactions are based on becoming aware of other's emotion and making adaptations accordingly. however, understanding emotion is a complex task that has generated countless debates among researchers over the past decades. the abstract nature of human emotion highlights the need for a new data-driven approach that can better describe and compare across fine-grained emotional states. in this study, we propose seemo, a novel neural embedding framework, which allows us to map human emotions into vector space representations. seemo is trained using twitter data and is evaluated on two fundamental use cases in traditional emotion research: determining the underlying dimensions of emotions and identifying the set of basic emotions. the evaluation reveals that on both tasks seemo can generate results consistent with the mainstream theories. results also show that the vector space representation of seemo can effectively decode the important relationships between emotions that were usually not explicitly presented.","here, we investigate creepiness as one's personal perception of an artefact, which is different from acceptability, which is understood as the lack of negative reactions from others.","with the increasing ubiquity of personal devices, social acceptability of human-machine interactions has gained relevance and growing interest from the hci community. yet, there are no best practices or established methods for evaluating social acceptability. design strategies for increasing social acceptability have been described and employed, but so far not been holistically appraised and evaluated. we offer a systematic literature analysis (n=69) of social acceptability in hci and contribute a better understanding of current research practices, namely, methods employed, measures and design strategies. our review identified an unbalanced distribution of study approaches, shortcomings in employed measures, and a lack of interweaving between empirical and artifact-creating approaches. the latter causes a discrepancy between design recommendations based on user research, and design strategies employed in artifact creation. our survey lays the groundwork for a more nuanced evaluation of social acceptability, the development of best practices, and a future research agenda.",362.0,759.0,44012.0
"medical practices have always been data oriented: healthcare providers decisions are based on data, both clinically generated and patient reported. with the increased use of patient-generated health data (pghd), other types of data are entering providers? practices and influencing patient-provider collaboration. we studied the use of pghd and its related data practices in the context of fertility, a health concern that is uncertain, complex, and data intensive. we interviewed 14 patients who are facing or have faced challenges to conceive and 5 healthcare providers specialized in infertility. our findings show that patients and providers use pghd in different ways but with the common goal of exploring 'the unknown' generated by the uncertainties of fertility. providers use patients? data in a rational protocol, aiming to identify possible causes of infertility and define a treatment course. patients use data in a much more emotional way, learning about their bodies while struggling with data interpretation challenges. by analyzing these data practices, we discuss the principles behind their differences and describe how they have individual benefits for each specific group. we then suggest that fertility technologies need to consider such principles, highlight the existing boundary between patients' and providers' data practices, and focus on bridging instead of merging them in order to facilitate collaboration and maintain their independent benefits.","these include mirroring the first-person view of the hmd user, providing access to the vr user's virtual world via a pc interface, projecting the immersive environment around the hmd user, and mounting peripheral devices onto the hmd to allow for interactions between hmd and non-hmd users.","mobile vr hmds enable scenarios where they are being used in public, excluding all the people in the surrounding (non-hmd users) and reducing them to be sole bystanders. we present facedisplay, a modified vr hmd consisting of three touch sensitive displays and a depth camera attached to its back. people in the surrounding can perceive the virtual world through the displays and interact with the hmd user via touch or gestures. to further explore the design space of facedisplay, we implemented three applications (fruitslicer, spaceface and conductor) each presenting different sets of aspects of the asymmetric co-located interaction (e.g. gestures vs touch). we conducted an exploratory user study (n=16), observing pairs of people experiencing two of the applications and showing a high level of enjoyment and social interaction with and without an hmd. based on the findings we derive design considerations for asymmetric co-located vr applications and argue that vr hmds are currently designed having only the hmd user in mind but should also include non-hmd users.",1033.0,53.0,6097.0
"text messaging-based conversational systems, popularly called chatbots, have seen massive growth lately. recent work on evaluating chatbots has found that there exists a mismatch between the chatbot's state of understanding (also called context) and the user's perception of the chatbot's understanding. users found it difficult to use chatbots for complex tasks as the users were uncertain of the chatbots' intelligence level and contextual state. in this work, we propose convey (context view), a window added to the chatbot interface, displaying the conversational context and providing interactions with the context values. we conducted a usability evaluation of convey with 16 participants. participants preferred using chatbot with convey and found it to be easier to use, less mentally demanding, faster, and more intuitive compared to a default chatbot without convey. the paper concludes with a discussion of the design implications offered by convey.","as with prior work, screen reader users have contextualized preferences for what is considered important in image descriptions.","alt text (short for ""alternative text"") is descriptive text associated with an image in html and other document formats. screen reader technologies speak the alt text aloud to people who are visually impaired. introduced with html 2.0 in 1995, the alt attribute has not evolved despite significant changes in technology over the past two decades. in light of the expanding volume, purpose, and importance of digital imagery, we reflect on how alt text could be supplemented to offer a richer experience of visual content to screen reader users. our contributions include articulating the design space of representations of visual content for screen reader users, prototypes illustrating several points within this design space, and evaluations of several of these new image representations with people who are blind. we close by discussing the implications of our taxonomy, prototypes, and user study findings.",465.0,58.0,22857.0
"as online platforms monitor and intervene in the daily lives of billions of people, platforms are being used to govern enduring social problems. field experiments could inform wise uses of this power if tensions between democratic values and experimentation could be resolved. in this paper, we introduce civilservant, a novel experimentation infrastructure that online communities and their moderators use to evaluate policies and replicate each others' findings. we situate civilservant in the political history of policy experiments and present design considerations for community participation, ethics, and replication. based on two case studies of community-led experiments and public debriefings on the reddit platform, we share findings on community deliberation about experiment results. we also report on uses of evidence, finding that experiments informed moderator practices, community policies, and replications by communities and platforms. we discuss the implications of these findings for evaluating platform governance in an open, democratic, experimenting society.","a growing body of research on hci and communication has examined the motives, processes, and consequences of distress disclosure on social media.","most us social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. for lgbtq+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. these choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. moreover, many lgbtq+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their lgbtq+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. this combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of lgbtq+ and other potentially stigmatized users. we adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 lgbtq+ social media users. we find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ""personal social media ecosystems"" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their lgbtq+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.",8.0,811.0,39515.0

"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches.","moving into the physical world, researchers have mined zebra-crossing locations to support route planning; created finger-mounted cameras to read text or recognise patterns on clothes; and built smart phone apps to help recognise personal objects and people.","recognizing others is a major challenge for people with visual impairments (vips) and can hinder engagement in social activities. we present accessibility bot, a research prototype bot on facebook messenger, that leverages state-of-the-art computer vision and a user's friends' tagged photos on facebook to help people with visual impairments recognize their friends. accessibility bot provides users information about identity and facial expressions and attributes of friends captured by their phone's camera. to guide our design, we interviewed eight vips to understand their challenges and needs in social activities. after designing and implementing the bot, we conducted a diary study with six vips to study its use in everyday life. while most participants found the bot helpful, their experience was undermined by perceived low recognition accuracy, difficulty aiming a camera, and lack of knowledge about the phone's status. we discuss these real-world challenges, identify suitable use cases for accessibility bot, and distill design implications for future face recognition applications.",997.0,213.0,23952.0

"with a seemingly endless stream of tasks, on-demand labor markets appear to offer workers flexibility in when and how much they work. this research argues that platforms afford workers far less flexibility than widely believed. a large part of the ""inflexibility"" comes from tight deadlines imposed on tasks, leaving workers little control over their work schedules. we experimentally examined the impact of offering workers control of their time in on-demand crowdwork. we found that granting higher ""in-task flexibility"" dramatically affected the temporal dynamics of worker behavior and produced a larger amount of work with similar quality. in a second experiment, we measured the compensating differential and found that workers would give up significant compensation to control their time, indicating workers attach substantial value to in-task flexibility. our results suggest that designing tasks which give workers direct control of their time within tasks benefits both buyers and sellers of on-demand crowdwork.","another recent study on youtube, audited the platform for various misinformative topics including vaccine controversies.","search engines are the primary gateways of information. yet, they do not take into account the credibility of search results. there is a growing concern that youtube, the second largest search engine and the most popular video-sharing platform, has been promoting and recommending misinformative content for certain search topics. in this study, we audit youtube to verify those claims. our audit experiments investigate whether personalization (based on age, gender, geolocation, or watch history) contributes to amplifying misinformation. after shortlisting five popular topics known to contain misinformative content and compiling associated search queries representing them, we conduct two sets of audits-search-and watch-misinformative audits. our audits resulted in a dataset of more than 56k videos compiled to link stance (whether promoting misinformation or not) with the personalization attribute audited. our videos correspond to three major youtube components: search results, up-next, and top 5 recommendations. we find that demographics, such as, gender, age, and geolocation do not have a significant effect on amplifying misinformation in returned search results for users with brand new accounts. on the other hand, once a user develops a watch history, these attributes do affect the extent of misinformation recommended to them. further analyses reveal a filter bubble effect, both in the top 5 and up-next recommendations for all topics, except vaccine controversies; for these topics, watching videos that promote misinformation leads to more misinformative video recommendations. in conclusion, youtube still has a long way to go to mitigate misinformation on its platform.",427.0,932.0,10898.0

"in recent years, remote collaboration has become increasingly common both in the workplace and in the classroom. it is imperative that we understand and support remote collaborative problem solving, particularly understanding the experiences of people from historically marginalized groups whose intellectual contributions are essential for addressing the pressing needs society faces. this paper reports on a study in which 58 introductory computer science students constructed code remotely with a partner following either predefined structured roles (driver and navigator in pair programming) or without predefined structured roles. between the structured-role and unstructured-role conditions, participants? normalized learning gain, intrinsic motivation inventory scores, and system usability scores were not significantly different. however, regardless of the collaboration condition, women reported significantly higher levels of stress, lower levels of perceived competence, and less perceived choice compared to men. because computer science is a context in which women have been historically marginalized, we next examined the relationship between student gender and collaborative dialogues by extracting lexical and sentiment features from the textual messages partners exchanged. results reveal that dialogue features, such as number of utterances, utterance length, and partner sentiment, significantly correlated with women's reports of stress, perceived competence, or perceived choice. these findings provide insight on women's experiences in remote programming, suggest that dialogue features can predict their collaborative experiences, and hold implications for designing systems that help provide collaborative experiences in which everyone can thrive.",these aas recordings capture how children make sense of technologies and how they use them in their everyday life.,"many traditional hci methods, such as surveys and interviews, are of limited value when working with preschoolers. in this paper, we present anchored audio sampling (aas), a remote data collection technique for extracting qualitative audio samples during field deployments with young children. aas offers a developmentally sensitive way of understanding how children make sense of technology and situates their use in the larger context of daily life. aas is defined by an anchor event, around which audio is collected. a sliding window surrounding this anchor captures both antecedent and ensuing recording, providing the researcher insight into the activities that led up to the event of interest as well as those that followed. we present themes from three deployments that leverage this technique. based on our experiences using aas, we have also developed a reusable open-source library for embedding aas into any android application.",1059.0,672.0,28868.0
"crowdsourcing marketplaces have provided a large number of opportunities for online workers to earn a living. to improve satisfaction and engagement of such workers, who are vital for the sustainability of the marketplaces, recent works have used conversational interfaces to support the execution of a variety of crowdsourcing tasks. the rationale behind using conversational interfaces stems from the potential engagement that conversation can stimulate. prior works in psychology have also shown that conversational styles can play an important role in communication. there are unexplored opportunities to estimate a worker's conversational style with an end goal of improving worker satisfaction, engagement and quality. addressing this knowledge gap, we investigate the role of conversational styles in conversational microtask crowdsourcing. to this end, we design a conversational interface which supports task execution, and we propose methods to estimate the conversational style of a worker. our experimental setup was designed to empirically observe how conversational styles of workers relate with quality-related outcomes. results show that even a naive supervised classifier can predict the conversation style with high accuracy (80%), and crowd workers with an involvement conversational style provided a significantly higher output quality, exhibited a higher user engagement and perceived less cognitive task load in comparison to their counterparts. our findings have important implications on task design with respect to improving worker performance and their engagement in microtask crowdsourcing.","alongside this critique, a number of works have emerged on the human infrastructure supporting technological systems.","we contribute a case study of el paquete semanal or ""the weekly package"" -- the pervasive, offline internet in cuba. we conducted a qualitative inquiry of el paquete through extensive fieldwork---interviews and observations---in havana, cuba. our findings highlight the human infrastructure that supports this offline internet, rendered visible through the lens of articulation work. by offering an in-depth perspective into these workings of el paquete, we aim to challenge established notions of what an (or the) internet ""should"" look like in more and less ""developed"" contexts. we highlight how el paquete is a non-standardized and non-neutral internet, but still human-centered. we also offer an enriched understanding of how an entirely offline internet can provide expansive information access to support leisure and livelihood, additionally serving as a locally relevant platform that affords local participation.",916.0,636.0,36802.0

"older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. to date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. to do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security.",we applied rfid contact switch pairs to identify and localize the stacking events between the cards and the tiles on the surface.,"we present rfibricks, an interactive building block system based on ultrahigh frequency radio-frequency identification (rfid) sensing. the system enables geometry resolution based on a simple yet highly generalizable mechanism: an rfid contact switch, which is made by cutting each rfid tag into two parts, namely antenna and chip. a magnetic connector is then coupled with each part. when the antenna and chip connect, an interaction event with an id is transmitted to the reader. on the basis of our design of rfid contact switch patterns, we present a system of interactive physical building blocks that resolves the stacking order and orientation when one block is stacked upon another, determines a three-dimensional (3d) geometry built on a two-dimensional base plate, and detects user inputs by incorporating electromechanical sensors. because it is calibration-free and does not require batteries in each block, it facilitates straightforward maintenance when deployed at scale. compared with other approaches, this rfid-based system resolves several critical challenges in human-computer interaction, such as 1) determining the identity and the built 3d geometry of passive building blocks, 2) enabling stackable token+constraint interaction on a tabletop, and 3) tracking in-hand assembly.",1061.0,187.0,30508.0

"in recent years, research has revealed gender biases in numerous software products. but although some researchers have found ways to improve gender participation in specific software projects, general methods focus mainly on detecting gender biases -- not fixing them. to help fill this gap, we investigated whether the gendermag bias detection method can lead directly to designs with fewer gender biases. in our 3-step investigation, two hci researchers analyzed an industrial software product using gendermag; we derived design changes to the product using the biases they found; and ran an empirical study of participants using the original product versus the new version. the results showed that using the method in this way did improve the software's inclusiveness: women succeeded more often in the new version than in the original; men's success rates improved too; and the gender gap entirely disappeared.","in four studies, higher social presence went along with a higher perception of the usability provided by the system.","we present mini-me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing mixed reality (mr) remote collaboration between a local augmented reality (ar) user and a remote virtual reality (vr) user. the mini-me avatar represents the vr user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the ar user's field of view. a user study was conducted to evaluate mini-me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in vr assisting a local worker in ar, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. we found that the presence of the mini-me significantly improved social presence and the overall experience of mr collaboration.",717.0,45.0,27885.0
"this paper examines the sense of presence, attitude change, perspective-taking, and usability of a split-sphere, first-person perspective 360 degree video about gender inequality, in which people can choose to watch the narrative from the male or female character's perspective. sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to watch (1) the video in 360 degree split-view in a head-mounted display, (2) the same film as 180 degree in a hmd, or (3) a flat control version of the video on a laptop. the 360 degree split-sphere increased the viewers' feeling of personal responsibility for resolving gender inequality, desire to rewatch the video, fear of missing out, and feeling of missing the full story. the 180 degree video created the strongest sense of presence, embodiment, and understanding of the character. however, people with greater egocentric projection onto the male character felt less responsible for resolving gender inequality, particularly in the 360 degree split-view.","points out, empowerment is not one size fits all.","empowering people through technology is of increasing concern in the hci community. however, there are different interpretations of empowerment, which diverge substantially. the same term thus describes an entire spectrum of research endeavours and goals. this conceptual unclarity hinders the development of a meaningful discourse and exchange. to better understand what empowerment means in our community, we reviewed 54 chi full papers using the terms empower and empowerment. based on our analysis and informed by prior writings on power and empowerment, we construct a framework that serves as a lens to analyze notions of empowerment in current hci research. finally, we discuss the implications of these notions of empowerment on approaches to technology design and offer recommendations for future work. with this analysis, we hope to add structure and terminological clarity to this growing and important facet of hci research.",542.0,242.0,40421.0
"understanding team viability --- a team's capacity for sustained and future success --- is essential for building effective teams. in this study, we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to train a viability classification model over a dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams. we train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. we find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 auc roc under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. from these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as 'but' and 'except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction. this work suggests opportunities for teams to assess, track, and visualize their own viability in real time as they collaborate.",miniature avatars seem to lower the perceived level of mental effort.,"we present mini-me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing mixed reality (mr) remote collaboration between a local augmented reality (ar) user and a remote virtual reality (vr) user. the mini-me avatar represents the vr user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the ar user's field of view. a user study was conducted to evaluate mini-me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in vr assisting a local worker in ar, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. we found that the presence of the mini-me significantly improved social presence and the overall experience of mr collaboration.",1036.0,45.0,27877.0

"our perception of our surrounding environment is limited by the constraints of human biology. the field of augmented perception asks how our sensory capabilities can be usefully extended through computational means. we argue that spatial awareness can be enhanced by exploiting recent advances in computer vision which make high-accuracy, real-time object detection feasible in everyday settings. we introduce hindsight, a wearable system that increases spatial awareness by detecting relevant objects in live 360-degree video and sonifying their position and class through bone conduction headphones. hindsight uses a deep neural network to locate and attribute semantic information to objects surrounding a user through a head-worn panoramic camera. it then uses bone conduction headphones, which preserve natural auditory acuity, to transmit audio notifications for detected objects of interest. we develop an application using hindsight to warn cyclists of approaching vehicles outside their field of view and evaluate it in an exploratory study with 15 users. participants reported increases in perceived safety and awareness of approaching vehicles when using hindsight.","human interaction with advertising has been an important part of hci research, from detecting advertising campaigns, to revealing privacy concerns, to understanding ad framing.","undisclosed online endorsements on social media can be misleading to users who may not know when viewed content contains advertisements. despite federal regulations requiring content creators to disclose online endorsements, studies suggest that less than 10% do so in practice. to overcome this issue, we need knowledge of how to best detect online endorsements, knowledge about how prevalent online endorsements are in the wild, and ways to design systems to automatically disclose advertising content to viewers. to that end, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a tool called adintuition which automatically discloses when youtube videos contain affiliate marketing, a type of social media endorsement. we evaluated adintuition with 783 users using a survey, field deployment, and diary study. we discuss our findings and recommendations for future measurements of and tools to detect and alert users about affiliate marketing content.",142.0,775.0,10538.0
"the tendency to believe and act on others' misinformation is documented in much prior work. this paper focuses on inaccuracy blindness, the tendency to take a collaborator's poor information at face value, which reduces problem-solving success. we draw on social psychological research from the 1970s showing that evaluative rating scales can prompt a change in perspective. in a series of studies, we prototyped and tested an evaluation prompt meant to encourage skepticism in participant detectives trying to identify a serial killer. in tests of the prototype, the prompt was partially successful in inducing skepticism (exp. 1), but a larger study (exp. 2) showed that, despite the evaluation prompt, participants' inaccuracy blindness persisted. this work, and the literature more generally, shows that the tendency to be misled by collaborators' inaccurate information remains a strong phenomenon that is hard to counteract and remains a significant challenge for the chi community.","some of the proposed technologies aim to strengthen the relationship by not letting parents interfere and allowing direct communication, since limiting parental scaffolding has shown to result in a strengthened relationship between grandchildren and their grandparents.","distance separated grandparents and grandchildren often face challenges in staying connected. to explore this topic, we designed g2g, a shared calendar and video messaging system to connect young children (ages 5-10) with their grandparents over distance. our design focused on providing grandparents and grandchildren with an awareness of each other's lives to support conversations and design elements to help reduce the need for parent scaffolding. a field study with two grandparent-grandchild pairs over two months showed that systems designed around structured communication can help young children develop a routine around staying in touch with their remote grandparents. autonomy in maintaining awareness can help children to be engaged more easily. this suggests that designs focusing on connecting young children to their grandparents over distance should be flexible yet structured and designing to reduce parental scaffolding can lead to positive effects and strengthened relationships.",491.0,154.0,29067.0

"a common objective for context-aware computing systems is to predict how user interfaces impact user performance regarding their cognitive capabilities. existing approaches such as questionnaires or pupil dilation measurements either only allow for subjective assessments or are susceptible to environmental influences and user physiology. we address these challenges by exploiting the fact that cognitive workload influences smooth pursuit eye movements. we compared three trajectories and two speeds under different levels of cognitive workload within a user study (n=20). we found higher deviations of gaze points during smooth pursuit eye movements for specific trajectory types at higher cognitive workload levels. using an svm classifier, we predict cognitive workload through smooth pursuit with an accuracy of 99.5% for distinguishing between low and high workload as well as an accuracy of 88.1% for estimating workload between three levels of difficulty. we discuss implications and present use cases of how cognition-aware systems benefit from inferring cognitive workload in real-time by smooth pursuit eye movements.","not surprisingly, for avatars it was found that with increased social presence also ratings for relatability and realism, physicality (only for asymmetric study), perceived intelligence (only for symmetric study), engagement, enjoyment, reciprocity, social richness and task performance were improved.","we present mini-me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing mixed reality (mr) remote collaboration between a local augmented reality (ar) user and a remote virtual reality (vr) user. the mini-me avatar represents the vr user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the ar user's field of view. a user study was conducted to evaluate mini-me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in vr assisting a local worker in ar, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. we found that the presence of the mini-me significantly improved social presence and the overall experience of mr collaboration.",433.0,45.0,27895.0

"the presence of observers and virtual characters can significantly shape our gaming experience. researchers suppose that most of the basic socio-psychological phenomena are also applicable for digital games. however, the social processes in gaming setups can differ from our experience in other social situations. our work emphasizes that awareness. insights are needed for the purposeful design of a game's social setting, specifically in applied contexts of learning and training. here, we focus on the social facilitation effect, which describes an unconscious change in performance due to the presence of others, by investigating the impact of real observers and virtual agents on player experience and performance in four different games. the results of our four studies show that, in contrast to previous assumptions, in-game success was not significantly influenced by the presence of any social entity, indicating that social facilitation does not generally apply to the context of playing digital games.","to reassure themselves of not being observed, many webcam users thus resort to blocking their webcam's view with stickers or sliding covers, a strategy that has been taken up in the hci literature and extended into solutions using eye-lid or curtain metaphors in interactive systems.","most of today's laptops come with an integrated webcam placed above the screen to enable video conferencing. due to the risk of webcam spying attacks, some laptop users seem to be concerned about their privacy and seek protection by covering the webcam. this paper is the first to investigate personal characteristics and beliefs of users with and without webcam covers by applying the theory of planned behavior. we record the privacy behavior of 180 users, develop a path model, and analyze it by applying partial least squares. the analysis indicates that privacy concerns do not significantly influence users' decision to use a webcam cover. rather, this behavior is influenced by users' attitudes, social environment, and perceived control over protecting privacy. developers should take this as a lesson to design privacy enhancing technologies which are convenient, verifiably effective and endorsed by peers.",99.0,178.0,38260.0
"complex machine learning models are deployed in several critical domains including healthcare and autonomous vehicles nowadays, albeit as functional blackboxes. consequently, there has been a recent surge in interpreting decisions of such complex models in order to explain their actions to humans. models which correspond to human interpretation of a task are more desirable in certain contexts and can help attribute liability, build trust, expose biases and in turn build better models. it is therefore crucial to understand how and which models conform to human understanding of tasks. in this paper we present a large-scale crowdsourcing study that reveals and quantifies the dissonance between human and machine understanding, through the lens of an image classification task. in particular, we seek to answer the following questions: which (well performing) complex ml models are closer to humans in their use of features to make accurate predictions? how does task difficulty affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans? are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image recognition more accurate? our findings have important implications on human-machine collaboration, considering that a long term goal in the field of artificial intelligence is to make machines capable of learning and reasoning like humans.","here, prior work looked into the use of wearable sensor devices, e.g., smart glasses in public spaces, lifelogging, and ubiquitous sensing in smart home applications.","as the internet of things (iot) devices make their ways into people's homes, traditional dwellings are turning into smart homes. while prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. we conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. we identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). we highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. we discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes.",876.0,879.0,38215.0
