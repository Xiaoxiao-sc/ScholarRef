"""I run the world's largest historical outreach project and it's on a cesspool of a website."" Moderating a Public Scholarship Site on Reddit: A Case Study of r/AskHistorians",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392822,"Online communities provide important functions in their participants' lives, from providing spaces to discuss topics of interest to supporting the development of close, personal relationships. Volunteer moderators play key roles in maintaining these spaces, such as creating and enforcing rules and modeling normative behavior. While these users play important governance roles in online spaces, less is known about how the work they do is impacted by platform design and culture. r/AskHistorians, a Reddit-based question and answer forum dedicated to providing users with academic-level answers to questions about history, provides an interesting case study on the impact of design and culture because of its unique rules and their strict enforcement by moderators. In this article I use interviews with r/AskHistorians moderators and community members, observation, and the full comment log of a highly upvoted thread to describe the impact of Reddit's design and culture on moderation work. Results show that visible moderation work that is often interpreted as censorship, and the default masculine whiteness of Reddit create challenges for moderators who use the subreddit as a public history site. Nonetheless, r/AskHistorians moderators have carved a space on Reddit where, through their public scholarship work, the community serves as a model for combating misinformation by building trust in academic processes. Volunteer moderators play key roles in online spaces as they create and enforce rules and model normative behavior. Using an ethnographic approach, this study explored moderation work in r/AskHistorians, an online community with a mission of promoting public history. As a public history site, r/AskHistorians operates under rules and norms that differ from those of the wider platform. Thus it is an apt case to study the impact of platform design and culture on moderation work. Results showed that visible moderation is often interpreted as censorship. This, coupled with the default masculine whiteness of Reddit, create challenges for moderators, such as encouraging empathy towards historical subjects and encouraging participation by marginalized populations. Nonetheless, r/AskHistorians moderators have carved a space on Reddit where, through its public scholarship work, the community serves as a model for combating misinformation by building trust in academic processes."
Improving Social Awareness Through DANTE: Deep Affinity Network for Clustering Conversational Interactants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392824,"We propose a data-driven approach to detect conversational groups by identifying spatial arrangements typical of these focused social encounters. Our approach uses a novel Deep Affinity Network (DANTE) to predict the likelihood that two individuals in a scene are part of the same conversational group, considering their social context. The predicted pair-wise affinities are then used in a graph clustering framework to identify both small (e.g., dyads) and large groups. The results from our evaluation on multiple, established benchmarks suggest that combining powerful deep learning methods with classical clustering techniques can improve the detection of conversational groups in comparison to prior approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach in a human-robot interaction scenario. Our efforts show that our work advances group detection not only in theory, but also in practice. We presented a novel approach for conversational group detection. Our method combined graph clustering with modern deep learning techniques to identify group interactions based on visual patterns of spatial behavior. Under the challenging T=1 F1 metric, our method significantly outperformed or performed as well as previous methods in a variety of conversational group detection benchmarks. Additionally, we obtained good results under the GDSR metric in a more general group detection task, showing the generalization capabilities of our proposed approach. From an algorithmic point of view, clear improvements were derived from better affinity scores used for graph clustering in comparison to prior work. Additionally, the use of data-driven methods allowed our approach to cope with complex spatial patterns of behavior without ad-hoc steps to verify group interactions. These features made our approach robust and practical to be applied in a real human-robot interaction scenario."
Real Differences between OT and CRDT in Correctness and Complexity for Consistency Maintenance in Co-Editors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392825,"OT (Operational Transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. CRDT (Commutative Replicated Data Type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of WOOT (WithOut Operational Transformation). Follow-up CRDT variations are commonly labeled as ""post-OT"" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors. On top of that, CRDT solutions have made broad claims of superiority over OT solutions, and often portrayed OT as an incorrect and inefficient technique. Over one decade later, however, CRDT is rarely found in working co-editors; OT remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. Contradictions between the reality and CRDT's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. To seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative OT and CRDT solutions and working co-editors based on them. From this work, we have made important discoveries about OT and CRDT, and revealed facts and evidences that refute CRDT claims over OT on all accounts. These discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between OT and CRDT in the real world. We report these results in a series of three articles. In this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between OT and CRDT in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. Moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative CRDT solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of OT and CRDT. We hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding OT and CRDT, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications. In this work, we have conducted comprehensive and critical reviews of representative OT and CRDT solutions for consistency maintenance in real-time co-editing, and made important research discoveries, which contribute to the advancement of the state-of-the-art knowledge on collaboration-enabling technology. This paper is the second in a series of three papers reporting our discoveries from this work. We summarize the main discoveries reported in this paper below, together with a brief description of the results reported in prior and follow-up papers as well. In the first paper [78], we have presented a general transformation framework for examining and comparing OT and CRDT, among a variety of consistency maintenance solutions in coediting, and revealed previously hidden but critical facts about CRDT: CRDT is like OT in following the same general transformation approach to consistency maintenance, albeit indirectly (in contrast to the direct transformation approach by OT); CRDT is the same as OT in making user-generated operations commutative after the fact; and CRDT operations are not natively commutative to editors, but require additional conversions between CRDT internal operations and external editing operations. Revealing these facts helps demystify what CRDT really is and is not to co-editing, and provide much-needed clarity for examining and understanding the real differences between OT and CRDT for co-editors Ì¶ their radically different ways of realizing the same general transformation. In the current paper, we have exploredwhat really differentiates OT and CRDT in correctness and complexity. One key insight from this investigation is: OT is concurrency-centric in the sense it treats generic concurrency issues among operations as its first priority at the core control algorithms, and isolates the handling of application-specific data and operation modelling issues in transformation functions; whereas CRDT is content-centric in the sense that it takes the first priority to manipulate internal application-related contents, including object sequences and schemes for searching and applying identifier-based operations in the object sequence, but mixes the handling of concurrency issues within object search and manipulation schemes. The concurrency-centric vs content-centric difference, together with the direct vs indirect difference in transformation, are fundamental and have profound implications to OT and CRDT solutions. The first significant implication is found in the different design and correctness issues in OT and CRDT solutions. Key OT design issues include designing core control algorithms to deal with generic concurrency issues, and designing separate transformation functions to handle application-specific issues. OT-special technical challenges and puzzles, such as ensuring contextbased conditions (e.g. the dOPT puzzle was a case of violating the context-equivalence condition), and avoiding or preserving CP2 (e.g. the FT puzzle was a case of violating the CP2 property in plain-text co-editing), were rooted in and solved under the concurrency-centric approach. Past OT research has established context-based conditions and transformation properties as the theoretic foundation for verifying and guiding the design of OT solutions. The correctness of key OT components in major OT solutions, including generic control algorithms and transformation functions for a range of operation and data models (e.g. string-wise plain-text editing and beyond), has been established on top of this theoretic foundation. In contrast, key CRDT design issues include designing CRDT-special data structures for representing the character sequence of the external document in an internal object sequence, immutable identifier-based operations, searching and executing identifier-based operations in the object sequence, and conversions between internal identifier-based operations and external position-based operations, which collectively deal with both application-specific and concurrency issues in co-editing. This approach has induced CRDT-specific challenges and puzzles, such as C/Ct-based complexity, tombstone overhead, complexity with variable identifiers, etc. In this work, we have revealed various correctness problems with Logoot (a representative non-tombstonebased CRDT), including inconsistent-position-integer-ordering, infinite loop flaws, position-orderviolation puzzles, and concurrent-insert-interleaving abnormalities. It remains an open challenge to resolve those issues under the CRDT approach to co-editing. The correctness of key CRDT components (e.g. object sequences, operation identifiers, and object sequence searching and manipulation schemes) in various CRDT solutions remains to be verified, using well-defined criteria, which are yet to be established as well. The second significant implication is found in the different time and space complexities among OT and CRDT solutions. OT complexity is determined by a variable c (for concurrency) â the number of concurrent operations involved in transforming an operation; CRDT complexity is dominated by a variable C (for Contents) or Ct (for Content with tombstones) â the number of objects maintained in the internal object sequence. In terms of theoretic complexity (see details in Table 4), CRDT has time complexities O(C) or O(Ct) for local operation processing, whereas OT has O(1) complexity. In terms of time complexity for remote processing and space complexity, both CRDT and OT have achieved linear complexities under respective variables c (for OT) and C/Ct (for CRDTs), which are seemingly similar in theory, but significantly different in practice: c is often bounded by a small value, e.g. 0 â¤ c â¤ 10, for a real-time session with a few (e.g. less than 5) users; C is orders of magnitude larger than c, e.g. 103 â¤ C â¤ 106 , for common plain text document sizes ranging from 1K to 1M characters; and Ct could be much larger than C due to the inclusion of tombstones. In real-time text co-editing, the following inequality commonly holds: Ct â« C â« c. It remains an open challenge to devise Ct/C-based CRDT solutions that could match c-based OT solutions in time and space complexity and in practical performance. The third implication is in the generality and extendibility of OT and CRDT solutions for coeditors. OT solutions separate generic concurrency issues from application-specific data and operation issues, with the core control algorithms being generally applicable to different application domains beyond text editing. Extensions of existing OT solutions can be and have been achieved by designing new transformation functions for new applications, without reinventing core control algorithms. In contrast, CRDT solutions mix concurrency issues with application-specific data and operation issues, with key CRDT components being intricately related to each other and coupled with application-specific object sequences and operations. The vast majority of published CRDT solutions for co-editing have been confined to plain-text editing. In the follow-up (the third) paper of this series [79], we report our discoveries on the differences between OT and CRDT in building co-editing systems and real world applications. In particular, we investigate the role of building co-editing systems in shaping OT and CRDT research and solutions. We review the evolution of co-editors from research vehicles to real world applications, and discuss representative OT-based co-editors and alternative design approaches in industry products and open source projects. Moreover, we evaluate CRDT-based co-editors in relation to published CRDT solutions, and re-confirm that CRDT operations and object sequences are not native to any editors. Last but not least, we examine technical factors related to ""peer-to-peer"" co-editing, such as the use of central servers, causally-ordered communication, and vector/scalar timestamping. Our study revealed all these factors are orthogonal to OT and CRDT, and the notion that CRDT is especially suitable for supporting ""peerto-peer"" co-editing is a fallacy. In summary, we have critically reviewed and compared representative OT and CRDT solutions, with respect to their basic approaches to consistency maintenance, correctness, time and space complexity, implementation and application in building co-editors, and suitability for peer-to-peer co-editing. The facts and evidences revealed from this work disprove CRDT superiority claims over OT on all accounts. These results help explain the underlying reasons behind the choices between OT and CRDT in real world co-editors and industrial products. Numerous alternative consistency maintenance solutions have been explored in past coediting research, and a wealth of experiences and lessons have been accumulated from those explorations. The time is ripe to review them critically and reflect on: what each alternative really is and has achieved so far, whether it has been validated by or is relevant to real world applications, and whither it is heading. This critical review work on OT and CRDT represents one attempt in this direction. For any alternative to be a viable solution in co-editing, in our view, it should offer capabilities that are genuinely superior to existing state-of-the-art solutions, and demonstrate its relevance in supporting real world co-editors. It is the real world application that provides ultimate validation to alternative solutions and to co-editing research in general. We hope discoveries from this work will help clear up common myths and misconceptions surrounding OT and CRDT, inspire fruitful explorations of novel collaboration techniques, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology innovation and real world application."
"How do Data Science Workers Collaborate? Roles, Workflows, and Tools",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392826,"Today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. However, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. In this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. We focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., Jupyter Notebook). We found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). We also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions. In this paper, we presented results of a large-scale survey of data science workers at a major corporation that examined how data science workers collaborate. We find that not only do data science workers collaborate extensively, they perform a variety of roles, and work with a variety of stakeholders during different stages of the data science project workflow. We also investigated the tools that data scientists use when collaborating, and how tool usage relates to collaborative practices such as code and data documentation. From this analysis, we present directions for future research and development of data science collaboration tools. In summary, we hope we have made the following contributions: â¢ The first large in-depth survey about data science collaborative practices, and the first large study to provide roles-based analyses of collaborations. â¢ The first large-scale study of data science activities during specific stages of data science projects. â¢ The first analysis of collaborative tools usage across the stages of data science projects. â¢ The first large-scale analysis of documentation practices in data science."
"""It's easier than causing confrontation"": Sanctioning Strategies to Maintain Social Norms and Privacy on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392827,"Sanctions play an essential role in enforcing and sustaining social norms. On social networking sites (SNS), sanctions allow individuals to shape community norms on appropriate privacy respecting behaviors. Existing theories of privacy assume the use of such sanctions but do not examine the extent and effectiveness of sanctioning behaviors. We conducted a qualitative interview study of young adults (N=23), and extend research on collective boundary regulation by studying sanctions in the context of popular SNS. Through a systematization of sanctioning strategies, we find that young adults prefer to use indirect and invisible sanctions to preserve strong-tie relationships. Such sanctions are not always effective in helping the violator understand the nature of their normative violation. We offer suggestions on supporting online sanctioning that make norms more visible and signal violations in ways that avoid direct confrontation to reduce the risk of harming on-going social relationships. In todayâs networked world individuals collaborate to regulate what is shared online. This collaboration between both content creators and viewers serves to shape and reinforce norms on appropriate privacy behaviors and content sharing on social networking sites. Sanctions play an essential role in this process to sustain social norms, thereby protecting privacy. Our study explored how young adults sanction norm violations regarding inappropriate content and their privacy behaviors across different social media. Through our findings, we systematize sanctioning strategies along three dimensions: who performs the sanction (a person or a group), where they sanction (on-site or off-site), and how apparent the sanction is to the violator (visible or invisible). In studying these strategies, we find that young adults are more than aware that imposing sanctions can come at a personal cost for those who want to maintain their relationships and avoid conflict. As a result, they often sought out discreet â indirect and invisible â sanctions despite their potential to fail in making the violator aware of the violation. We posit that for sanctions to achieve their goals of shaping online behaviors, we need tools that make online norms visible to the violator and signal violations when they occur without unnecessary burden or direct personal conflict. In the process, all parties might be better able to âsave faceâ and the relationships with each other that they value so much."
"""They Just Don't Get It"": Towards Social Technologies for Coping with Interpersonal Racism",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392828,"Over 35% of Americans belong to racial minority groups. Racism targeting these individuals results in a range of harmful physical, psychological, and practical consequences. The present work aims to shed light on the current sense-making and support-seeking practices exhibited by targets of racism, as well as to identify the core needs and barriers that future socio-technical interventions could potentially address. The long-term goal of this work is to understand how CSCW researchers and designers could best support members of marginalized groups to make sense of and to seek support for experiences with racism. Narrative episode interviews with targets of racism revealed a number of key entry points for intervention. For example, participants' personal stories confirmed that uncertainty, both about the nature and consequences of the experience of racism, is a key motivator for support-seeking. In addition, despite the need for support, participants largely do not trust public forms of social media for support-seeking. We discuss how participants' accounts of the complex labor involved in determining who ""gets it"" in identifying potential supporters, and in navigating the complexities of trust and agency in sharing their experiences, present clear implications for the design of new socio-technical platforms for members of racial minority groups. Seeking social support following racist experiences can be a challenge for targets of racism. In both online and offline contexts, there is a substantial risk of emotional, psychological, and practical consequences. Additionally, the ambiguous nature of experiences of modern racism complicate coping and provide additional barriers to support-seeking. In this work, we explore the complexities and nuances involved in seeking support following experiences with racism. We find that uncertainty surrounding the nature of the experience as well as its consequences is a primary motivator for support-seeking behavior. Once a target has shared with a potential supporter, supporters and targets work together to make meaning of the event through uncertainty reduction. This is typically only possible when a supporter first validates the subjective experience of the target, either in-the-moment or through previous interactions with the target. When potential supporters introduce additional uncertainty during the meaning-making process, it hampers the coping of the target. Targets engage in a number of practices to ensure that they have ready access to potential supporters, such as cultivating relevant relationships before a racist experience occurs. From these findings, we demonstrate opportunities for researchers and designers who wish to create solutions that facilitate coping through support-seeking following racist experiences. This work may have implications beyond the context of vulnerable groups. Prejudice and discrimination are experienced alongside a wide range of facets of identity. For example, previous work on microaggressions explores gender, racial-ethnic identity, and sexual orientation. Our work examines how people from racially marginalized groups successfully cope with experiences of racist oppression in an effort to uncover opportunities and challenges in amplifying and supporting those practices at scale, but we believe that this approach can be extended to other marginalized populations as well. We envision a future where sociotechnical systems promote the safety and empowerment of people from marginalized groups in fighting against their experiences with prejudice and marginalization by sharing, communicating, and supporting each other. This work is intended to provide a foundation for other members of the CSCW community to respond to this challenge and contribute to a growing body of theoretical, empirical, and technical work that helps bring that future closer to reality."
How to Support Newcomers in Scientific Hackathons - An Action Research Study on Expert Mentoring,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392830,"Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival. We are currently in the process of developing the second cycle of the presented action research study which will take place within the same community. Using the aspects outlined in the discussion as a basis we developed guiding materials for organizers and mentors (sections 5.1 and 5.2) that will we use during the planning phase of the hackathon. Changes to the format include checkpoints for teams to get early feedback, suggestions for mentors to abstain from assuming a stakeholder role, connect to students and focus on studentsâ learning gains rather than the completion of a pre-envisioned project. The data collection procedure and instruments used will remain largely the same with a stronger focus on the mentors since most suggestions we developed are targeted at them. We will also alter the focus of the data collection to assess the impact of the aforementioned interventions and include an additional data collection point three to six months after the hackathon to identify potential long-term effects related to the projects that were developed during the hackathon. Moreover, to better cover the community engagement aspect of the studied hackathon we will add a corresponding scale to the questionnaire. The proposed scale has been successfully been used in the context of online communities [22] to assess individual commitment to and identification with a community. In this paper we presented findings from an action research study on assigning community members as mentors to teams of newcomers during a scientific hackathon. Our findings provided tentative insights into the interaction between mentors and teams and their perception of their hackathon project and their future intentions towards the community that organized the hackathon. Our work not only addresses an important shortcoming in scientific literature on hackathons by studying mentoring in a specific hackathon event. Our findings can also support scientific communities to use hackathons as a means to attract newcomers which is crucial for their survival."
Evaluating News Media Reports on the 'Blue Whale Challenge' for Adherence to Suicide Prevention Safe Messaging Guidelines,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392831,"The Blue Whale Challenge (BWC) is an online viral ""game"" that allegedly encourages youth and young adults towards self-harming behaviors that could eventually lead to suicide. The BWC can be situated within a larger phenomenon of viral online self-harm challenges, which may be propagated through both social media and news sources. Research has established that suicide is a global public health issue that is known to be influenced by media reporting. Violation of safe messaging guidelines has been shown to increase imitative suicides, particularly in youth and young adults. Given the confirmed effects of news media reporting, we analyzed 150 digital newspaper articles reporting on the BWC to assess whether they adhered to suicide prevention safe messaging guidelines. Overall, 81% of the articles violated at least one contagion-related guideline, most commonly normalizing suicide, discussing means of suicide, and sensationalizing. Even though the majority (91%) of the articles adhered to at least one health-promotion guideline, such as emphasizing prevention, the articles did not follow these guidelines on a deep and comprehensive level. Through thematic analysis, we also found evidence of potential misinformation in reporting, where the articles unequivocally attributed many suicides to the BWC with little or no evidence. Additionally, articles often stated an individual's reason for participating in the challenge without interviewing the individual or those close to the individual, another aspect of potential misinformation due to lack of evidence. A contribution of the current study is the synthesis of safe messaging guidelines that can be used in future research. This study contributes to the understanding of news reporting practices regarding suicide and self-harm in regard to the BWC and similar online challenges. We discuss how sensationalized news media reports on the BWC could unintentionally propagate suicide contagion effects that normalize self-harming behaviors among youth. We then examine implications for practice and policy, such using automated approaches to aid reporters in adhering to safe messaging guidelines. Our study synthesizes suicide prevention safe messaging guidelines and evaluates news practices regarding the Blue Whale Challenge. In sum, it is evident that there is still room for improvement in the realm of reporting on suicide, self-harm, and harmful online challenges in the media to combat the problem of contagion. A major contribution of the current study is the synthesis of what were previously disjointed sets of suicide prevention safe messaging guidelines. Overall, our findings reinforce the notion that adherence to safe messaging guidelines is not yet adequate. We also found evidence of misinformation, as authors often used causational language and speculated about why individuals participated in the BWC without evidence. Our findings lead to recommending interventions such as further education of news reporters and application of recent advances in natural language processing software in order to decrease contagion. There is an opportunity to dampen the harmful consequences that result from poor quality reports of suicidal behavior and decrease the potential for suicide contagion in reporting on online selfharm and suicide."
Methods for Generating Typologies of Non/use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392832,"Prior studies of technology non-use demonstrate the need for approaches that go beyond a simple binary distinction between users and non-users. This paper proposes a set of two different methods by which researchers can identify types of non/use relevant to the particular sociotechnical settings they are studying. These methods are demonstrated by applying them to survey data about Facebook non/use. The results demonstrate that the different methods proposed here identify fairly comparable types of non/use. They also illustrate how the two methods make different trade offs between the granularity of the resulting typology and the total sample size. The paper also demonstrates how the different typologies resulting from these methods can be used in predictive modeling, allowing for the two methods to corroborate or disconfirm results from one another. The discussion considers implications and applications of these methods, both for research on technology non/use and for studying social computing more broadly."
From Paper Flight Strips to Digital Strip Systems: Changes and Similarities in Air Traffic Control Work Practices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392833,"To increase capacity and safety in air traffic control, digital strip systems have superseded paper strips in lower airspace control centers in Europe. Previous ethnographic studies on paper strip systems anticipated a radical change in work practices with digital strip systems, but we are not aware of any studies that evaluated these predictions. We carried out contextual inquiries with controllers and focused on face-to-face and radio communication, interactions with the digital strip system and the workspace in general. In turn, we contribute (1) detailed descriptions of controllers' work practices, such as using tacit information from radio communication and 'standard advocates vs. tinkerers' operation modes, (2) respective implications for design and (3) discuss how the observed work practices are similar or different from the reported practices in the literature of the two preceding decades. Our key insights are, that documentation speed is faster with digital strips, although a high load in the case of radio frequency persists. Controllers retrieve tacit information from the radio communication and combine it with scattered cues from several displays to form empathic decisions that sometimes exceed the standard protocol. We conclude that the role of tacit information holds opportunities for future flight systems and should be considered in a holistic approach to individualized workspaces for controllers. In this article, we present observation and interview data on how controllers are actually using digital strip system workstations today. Air traffic management is designed to be a highly standardized safety-critical workplace. Our key insights indicate, however, that (1) controllers are most efficient when they also have access to tacit information such as emotions or the fitness of pilots. Based on this tacit information and given the scarce information from the ground radar, (2) experienced approach controllers took educated guesses that were beneficial to the structure of arrivals and departures. The price for these meta-information conveyed through human language is that (3) radio communication is todayâs bottleneck in ATC capacity because it limits the number of aircraft a single controller can manage. To achieve more efficiency and to please pilots in medium traffic, (4) controllersâ work styles exceed standard protocols. Finally, both our interview data and the literature indicate that (5) digital strip systems run more stable and enable controllers to document faster compared to paper strips. In safety-critical domains such as ATC, stability and faster interactions leave more resources for other tasks and therefore are likely to promote safety. Therefore, we tend to answer negatively to the question âIs paper safer?â compared to digital strip systems posed by Mackay [34] over two decades ago. With the rise in text-based communications and further transitions towards strip-independent interfaces, such as a single view of air traffic, the advantage of digital interfaces in terms of safety and capacity will become even more obvious. Because digital paper strips were merely designed as transitional system in electronic flight data management to increase automation [18], this raises questions for future research about how much capacity ATC systems will have once the transition is completed. From our key insights we derived implications for future systems in air traffic control. A digital workplace facilitates assistive systems and individualization, which are partly implemented already and offer great potential to increase efficiency and safety. Our findings indicate, that in future ATC systems relevant information needs to be presented in one individualized workspace, which is tailored to the needs outlined above and replaces the cluster of hardware modules grown over decades. Increased automation and transition to text communication, for example for standard clearances, may help to diminish the capacity restriction caused by radio communication. However, designers need to find holistic concepts that still harvest the benefits of tacit information to uphold the controllersâ team situation awareness about the pilotsâ context. An example of how this can be achieved is the shared information on the ground radar that helps controllers to assess the tower controllersâ needs. The transition to novel interfaces will bear the challenge for designers to incorporate control over partly automated steps. Most important, there is an opportunity to sustain and enhance future flight systems to harness the rich information and appreciative collegiality contained in communication among actors on the ground and in the air."
The Effect of Sociocultural Variables on Sarcasm Communication Online,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392834,"Online social networks (OSN) play an essential role for connecting people and allowing them to communicate online. OSN users share their thoughts, moments, and news with their network. The messages they share online can include sarcastic posts, where the intended meaning expressed by the written text is different from the literal one. This could result in miscommunication. Previous research in psycholinguistics has studied the sociocultural factors the might lead to sarcasm misunderstanding between speakers and listeners. However, there is a lack of such studies in the context of OSN. In this paper we fill this gap by performing a quantitative analysis on the influence of sociocultural variables, including gender, age, country, and English language nativeness, on the effectiveness of sarcastic communication online. We collect examples of sarcastic tweets directly from the authors who posted them. Further, we ask third-party annotators of different sociocultural backgrounds to label these tweets for sarcasm. Our analysis indicates that age, English language nativeness, and country are significantly influential and should be considered in the design of future social analysis tools that either study sarcasm directly, or look at related phenomena where sarcasm may have an influence. We also make observations about the social ecology surrounding sarcastic exchanges on OSNs. We conclude by suggesting ways in which our findings can be included in future work. In this paper we have considered how sarcastic communication in OSNs can be influenced by the sociocultural backgrounds of the interlocutors. We asked whether similar backgrounds lead to more effective communication, which sociocultural variables have the most influence on the effectiveness, and whether the influence is alleviated by the presence of contextual information found publicly on the OSNs. Consulting psycholinguistic studies of sarcastic communication, as well as linguistic theories as sarcasm, we chose four variables for investigation: gender, age, country, and English language nativeness. For our experiments, we collected sarcastic tweets from Twitter users who posted them (whom we call speakers), implicitly labelled by the users themselves (intended labels). We then had third-party annotators (whom we call listeners) further label these tweets for sarcasm (perceived labels). Finally, we compared intended and perceived labels using f-score as a quantifier for similarity. Our results indicate that age, English language nativeness, and gender are statistically influential. The influence of age is maintained even when contextual information is available. We suggest that these variables, along with public social information, should be included in the future design of social analysis tools that either investigate sarcasm directly, or look at related phenomena where sarcasm may have an influence, such as the expression of sentiment, emotion, and hate-speech. We also made observations regarding social behaviour. We noted a more effective sarcastic communication across genders in the UK compared to the US, but more effective across ages in the US compared to the UK. Furthermore, we noted that UK females may use a more apparent form of sarcasm, compared to the more subtle sarcasm of US speakers. Finally, contextual information seemed more indicative of the sarcasm of US males than of that of UK females. In future work we plan to address the main limitations of the current work. First, despite being the largest study of its kind to out knowledge, we still only investigate two speaker backgrounds, F-25-34-UK and M-25-34-US. We plan to explore more in the future. Second, we plan to account for potential variations in the usage of sarcasm across the United States. Finally, we intend to study potential interactions between sociocultural variables. To make a statistically significant claim in this direction, we need labels from all possible sociocultural backgrounds spanned by the variables we consider, which we plan to collect in the future."
"""Learning for the Rise of China"": Exploring Uses and Gratifications of State-Owned Online Platform",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392835,"In January 2019, the Chinese Communist Party launched the online platform XueXi QiangGuo, which translates into ""Learning for the Rise of China."" Within two months, XueXi became the top-downloaded item of the month on Apple's App Store in China. In response, we conducted an interview study with 28 active XueXi users to investigate their uses and gratifications of this state-owned online platform. Our results reveal seven key motivations: compliance, self-status seeking, general information seeking, job support, entertainment, patriotism, and learning. This state-owned platform introduced a new model for official information dissemination and political communication through direct surveillance and monitoring, leveraging and fostering emotional attachment, and offering heterogeneous apolitical content. We discuss the intended and unintended ramifications of these components, highlighting the importance of future CSCW research to critically engage with pluralist political narratives situated in varied societies, especially non-Western democracies. In this paper, we presented a qualitative study on the uses and gratifications of the Chinese application XueXi QiangGuo and described the factors that influence peopleâs participation in this platform. People derive a variety of uses and gratifications from XueXi, and these gratifications can be influenced by various personal, organizational, and sociopolitical factors. We synthesized these gratifications into their influencing factors and underscored the state-owned platformâs uniqueness in guiding opinion and disseminating official information, namely employing direct surveillance, leveraging and fostering emotional attachment, and offering side apolitical content for discretionary use. We critically discussed the intended and unintended consequences of these components and situated the discussion in Chinaâs unique historical, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts. Finally, we highlighted the importance for future CSCW researchers and practitioners to engage with local contexts and constructs when designing and evaluating artifacts like XueXi."
Designing a Chatbot as a Mediator for Promoting Deep Self-Disclosure to a Real Mental Health Professional,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392836,"Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. One promising application for chatbots is to elicit people's self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. As receiving one's deep self-disclosure is critical for mental health professionals to understand people's mental status, chatbots show great potential in the mental health domain. However, there is a lack of research addressing if and how people self-disclose sensitive topics to a real mental health professional (MHP) through a chatbot. In this work, we designed, implemented and evaluated a chatbot that offered three chatting styles; we also conducted a study with 47 participants who were randomly assigned into three groups where each group experienced the chatbot's self-disclosure at varying levels respectively. After using the chatbot for a few weeks, participants were introduced to a MHP and were asked if they would like to share their self-disclosed content with the MHP. If they chose to share, the participants had the option of changing (adding, deleting, and editing) the content they self-disclosed to the chatbot. Comparing participants' self-disclosure data the week before and the week after sharing with the MHP, our results showed that, within each group, the depth of participants' self-disclosure to the chatbot remained after sharing with the MHP; participants exhibited deeper self-disclosure to the MHP through a more self-disclosing chatbot; further, through conversation log analysis, we found that some participants made different edits on their self-disclosed content before sharing it with the MHP. Participants' interview and survey feedback suggested an interaction between participants' trust in the chatbot and their trust in the MHP, which further explained participants' self-disclosure behavior. This study investigates how a chatbot as a mediator can be used by people for self-disclosing to a mental health professional and how peopleâs trust in a chatbot interacts with their trust in a mental health professional. Our findings suggest that the chatbotâs self-disclosure successfully elicits participantsâ self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts and feelings not only to the chatbot but also to the mental health professional. Our work also provides empirical evidence of different self-disclosure behavior, such as reducing or adding content, that people may take before sharing their self-disclosure to a chatbot with a mental health professional. Several factors contributed to their behavior. On the one hand, we identified an effective chatbot design that has promising potential to serve as a mediator to promote self-disclosure to mental health professionals; on the other hand, several ethical issues are discussed for future chatbot designs."
Estimating Conversational Styles in Conversational Microtask Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392837,"Crowdsourcing marketplaces have provided a large number of opportunities for online workers to earn a living. To improve satisfaction and engagement of such workers, who are vital for the sustainability of the marketplaces, recent works have used conversational interfaces to support the execution of a variety of crowdsourcing tasks. The rationale behind using conversational interfaces stems from the potential engagement that conversation can stimulate. Prior works in psychology have also shown that conversational styles can play an important role in communication. There are unexplored opportunities to estimate a worker's conversational style with an end goal of improving worker satisfaction, engagement and quality. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigate the role of conversational styles in conversational microtask crowdsourcing. To this end, we design a conversational interface which supports task execution, and we propose methods to estimate the conversational style of a worker. Our experimental setup was designed to empirically observe how conversational styles of workers relate with quality-related outcomes. Results show that even a naive supervised classifier can predict the conversation style with high accuracy (80%), and crowd workers with an Involvement conversational style provided a significantly higher output quality, exhibited a higher user engagement and perceived less cognitive task load in comparison to their counterparts. Our findings have important implications on task design with respect to improving worker performance and their engagement in microtask crowdsourcing. In this work, we explored how the conversational style of a crowd worker could be reliably estimated during crowdsourcing microtasking, and the relationship between conversational styles and qualityrelated outcomes, worker engagement and cognitive task load. We addressed RQ1 by proposing a coding scheme for style estimation based on the five dimensions of examined linguistic devices, and style prediction methods using either rich conversational data or limited conversational data. We answered RQ2 by performing a crowdsourcing experiment to analyze the behaviour of crowd workers with different conversational styles during crowdsourcing microtasking in terms of the output quality, worker engagement and cognitive task load. We found that common classifiers could obtain a reasonably good accuracy in conversation style prediction. Furthermore, experimental results revealed that workersâ Involvement conversational style relates with higher output quality, higher user engagement and less perceived task load in tasks with higher difficulty."
The Role of Conversational Grounding in Supporting Symbiosis Between People and Digital Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392838,"In ""smart speaker'' digital assistant systems such as Google Home, there is no visual user interface, so people must learn about the system's capabilities and limitations by experimenting with different questions and commands. However, many new users give up quickly and limit their use to a few simple tasks. This is a problem for both the user and the system. Users who stop trying out new things cannot learn about new features and functionality, and the system receives less data upon which to base future improvements. Symbiosis---a mutually beneficial relationship---between AI systems like digital assistants and people is an important aspect of developing systems that are partners to humans and not just tools. In order to better understand requirements for symbiosis, we investigated the relationship between the types of digital assistant responses and users' subsequent questions, focusing on identifying interactions that were discouraging to users when speaking with a digital assistant. We conducted a user study with 20 participants who completed a series of information seeking tasks using the Google Home, and analyzed transcripts using a method based on applied conversation analysis. We found that the most common response from the Google Home, a version of ""Sorry, I'm not sure how to help'', provided no feedback for participants to build on when forming their next question. However, responses that provided somewhat strange but tangentially related answers were actually more helpful for conversational grounding, which extended the interaction. We discuss the connection between grounding and symbiosis, and present recommendations for requirements for forming partnerships with digital assistants. Licklider envisioned man-machine symbiosis in 1960, which he described as working together with a computer as closely as one would with a âcolleague whose competence supplements your ownâ [29, p. 5]. Many AI systems, including digital assistants, have the potential to build a mutually benecial partnership with people through providing support for learning by the system and by the user. Our ndings showed that when the system encounters a question it cannot answer, the process of conversational grounding can bridge the gap between the system and the human user, as long as the system provides an opening for grounding to occur in the form of feedback about the ambiguity of the systemâs ability to respond in that moment. This opening for grounding to happen is an opportunity to promote exploration and support learnability for both partners. Therefore, we argue that machine learning models in digital assistants should be optimized not just for accuracy, but also for new opportunities for grounding. By combining advanced data-driven techniques with support for human conversation partners to form common ground about digital assistants, we argue that the symbiotic relationship can be achieved. These ndings and implications add to the growing body of knowledge on how to design meaningful human-AI interaction, and provide guidance to designers of digital assistants for exploring new ways to build symbiotic relationships between users and AI systems."
"I Share, You Care: Private Status Sharing and Sender-Controlled Notifications in Mobile Instant Messaging",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392839,"While mobile instant messaging (MIM) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. We examine two design concepts for MIM-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. Private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. Sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. We built MyButler, an Android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with KakaoTalk, a commercial MIM app. During a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. Participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. We reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in MIM communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of MIM users in choosing whether to alert their messages. In terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. We found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. Based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations. We studied and analyzed how two design concepts for MIM communication, private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications, impact mobile usersâ chat behavior. We built MyButler, an Android app prototype that enables the application of two design concepts, to work seamlessly with a commercial MIM app, KakaoTalk. We conducted a two-week field study using MyButler followed by retrospective interviews with 11 pairs of friends and couples. Through the field study, we studied how MIM users adopt these two concepts and how the added functions affect their MIM behaviors in their natural, in-situ messaging environments. We found that private status sharing lessens the pressure and expectations for immediate response in MIM, as their personalized and customized status sharing plays the role of shared understanding of real-time (un)availability. Sender-controlled notifications bring the autonomy to the sender to manage their notifications according to the statuses of the receiverâs and their own, consideration of receiver-side interruptions, and concerns on message content exposure to others."
The New Reality of Reproducibility: The Role of Data Work in Scientific Research,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392840,"Although reproducibility--the idea that a valid scientific experiment can be repeated with similar results--is integral to our understanding of good scientific practice, it has remained a difficult concept to define precisely. Across scientific disciplines, the increasing prevalence of large datasets, and the computational techniques necessary to manage and analyze those datasets, has prompted new ways of thinking about reproducibility. We present findings from a qualitative study of a NSF--funded two-week workshop developed to introduce an interdisciplinary group of domain scientists to data-management techniques for data-intensive computing, with a focus on reproducible science. Our findings suggest that the introduction of data-related activities promotes a new understanding of reproducibility as a mechanism for local knowledge transfer and collaboration, particularly as regards efficient software reuse. In this paper, weâve shown how the integration of data-science tools and techniques into the work practices of domain scientists coincides with a reorientation of the concept of reproducibility. As our participants assimilate data-science activities into their work, they begin to understand reproducibility more strongly along a local dimensionâas a means to collaborate and facilitate knowledge transfer, via the implementation of state-of-the-art technologies, such as containerization softwareâand less strongly along a global dimension, associated with abstract values of scientific integrity. Our goal here is not to generalize these specific findings to all disciplines in all locales. Rather, we use these findings to sensitize the research community to a number of useful approaches to understanding the proliferation of data tools in scientific work. Firstly, it suggests a way of examining the reproducibility movement not as a monolithic crisis, but as a highly variegated movement across different research cultures. Secondly, while the effort that has been put into constructing analytical distinctions between concepts like replication and reproducibility is valuable, there is also value in following the researchersâ own understandings of reproducibility in practice. As argued by Jackson, Steinhardt, and Buyuktur [31], such meanings are crucial to policy and design of computational tools. Finally, we can avoid taking data tools as a neutral substrate for scientific investigation, and instead examine how such tools embody shifting standards of excellence in scientific work. Changes in tools have real consequences for the way researchers evidence their findings and evaluate the findings of others, and are at the center of the âculture changeâ occurring around reproducibility. This observation lends new recognition and new responsibility to the work of research software engineers, technicians, developers, and designers in science. As the availability of large datasets continues to increase, and as the tools and techniques to manage and analyze these datasets become more widely accessible, we can expect that more people in diverse fields and professions will begin to integrate data-related tasks into their pursuits. These other domains of practice are likely to alter around the adoption of data work. In this paper, we provide an illustrative example of how the uptake of data-science activities might affect how people understand the fundamental concepts that inform their work. Still, because of the nature of our study, our findings are necessarily localized. While the workshop setting provides a strategic point of observation, it also presents some limitations. Extending the study longitudinally, and looking at the use of reproducibility tools in everyday scientific practice, rather than in the educational workshop setting would be valuable. Furthermore, as shown by the distinction researchers made in the workshop between acceptable and excessive forms of coding, the kinds of tasks that constitute science are shifting in response to the adoption of data practices. Another area of fruitful study might explore the evolving divisions between science and often-sidelined types of technical work, such as research software engineering. Finally, there are strong affinities between the concerns of researchers in doing reproducible science and the concerns of the broader software development community in developing software effectively through documentation, adhering to development methods, and avoiding technical debt. These affinities are well worth investigating as further characteristics that distinguish computational reproducibility from broader notions of reproducibility, and as developing connections between scientific software development and industrial cultures of software development."
Shifting forms of Engagement: Volunteer Learning in Online Citizen Science,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392841,"Peer production projects involve people in many tasks, from editing articles to analyzing datasets. To facilitate mastery of these practices, projects offer a number of learning resources, ranging from project-defined FAQsto individually-oriented search tools and communal discussion boards. However, it is not clear which project resources best support participant learning, overall and at different stages of engagement. We draw onSÃ¸rensen's framework of forms of presence to distinguish three types of engagement with learning resources:authoritative, agent-centered and communal. We assigned resources from the Gravity Spy citizen-science into these three categories and analyzed trace data recording interactions with resources using a mixed-effects logistic regression with volunteer performance as an outcome variable. The findings suggest that engagement with authoritative resources (e.g., those constructed by project organizers) facilitates performance initially. However, as tasks become more difficult, volunteers seek and benefit from engagement with their own agent-centered resources and community-generated resources. These findings suggest a broader scope for the design of learning resources for peer production. In this article, we investigate the behaviors of volunteers in an online citizen science project. Applying SÃ¸rensenâs theory about forms of presence, we determine how volunteersâ resource engagements change as their relationship to the project changes and the complexity of the task increases. Volunteers begin their tenure as citizen scientists relying primarily on authority-subject and communal engagements. As the task difficulty increases, volunteersâ reliance on authoritysubject engagements subsides significantly and other forms of engagements become more central namely agent-centered and communal. These results are buttressed by responses from superusers who provide context to the quantitative findings presented in this article. Volunteers emphasized that, as the glitch classification task becomes more challenging, social participation becomes necessary as a form of question asking, learning about the practices of other volunteers, and performing their own analysis to make sense of ambiguous glitch classes. Overall, the findings suggests that social participation and independent work can enhance the learning experiences of participants in peer production. Project organizers should consider approaches to include communal resources in peopleâs learning experiences and provide directed instruction for independent work."
Stuck in the middle with you: The Transaction Costs of Corporate Employees Hiring Freelancers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392842,"Corporations are increasingly empowering employees to hire on-demand workers via freelance platforms. We interviewed full-time employees of a global technology company who hired freelancers as part of their job responsibilities. While there has been prior work describing freelancers' perspectives there has been little research on those that hire them, the ""clients"", especially in the corporate context. We found that while freelance platforms reduce many administrative burdens, there are number of conditions in which using freelance platforms in a corporate context creates high transaction costs and power asymmetries that make it difficult for clients to negotiate work rights and responsibilities. This leads corporate employee clients to feel ""stuck in the middle"" between their employer, the platform, and the freelancer. Ultimately, these transactions costs are a potential barrier to wider adoption. If corporations want to leverage the value of the freelance economy then better guardrails, guidelines, and perhaps even creative technology solutions will be needed. The key benefit to clients in using freelancers was to save time, and this time savings came in a variety of ways. First, it came through simply having more people available to work. Having access to more brainpower meant more work could get done faster. Second, it came through clients using their time more efficiently. For example, clients could hire a freelancer with the skills necessary for the task at hand when the client might not have had those skills themselves. This saved the client the ramp up time of learning new skills, which, in turn, allowed the client to focus their time on the core parts of their job, utilizing the specialized skills they already built up. Finally, there was less overhead and faster on-boarding time in hiring a freelancer than using a traditional staffing agency. With these myriad benefits, one might have expected clients to rampantly hire freelancers to improve the speed and efficiency of their business while reducing costs. Instead clients moved more cautiously due to their concerns about responsible use and transaction costs like task definition and management overhead. We also saw that clients care about working with freelancers responsibly both in terms of making sure the freelancer is getting a fair deal and in terms of contemplating what the growth of the freelance economy means for themselves and their careers. It is not the case that clients are simply trying to take advantage of labor arbitrage and just get work done cheaper. In fact, some non-managers were explicitly turned off by talk of cost savings. A common use case is for clients to work with freelancers when they need a task done that they do not know how to do themselves. We found that in this case clients do not know how to adequately describe the task, how to set milestones for it, how to vet freelancers who apply, or how to set the payment amount. Thus the very reason that brought the client to the freelance platform was a key reason that the outcome was not what the client hoped for and the work output of the freelancer was discarded. Often in this case the client blames themselves for this outcome. Since clients were unclear as to how much they could manage and how they could manage, they found it difficult to course correct when a project got off track. This, combined with the general amount of overhead clients faced in managing freelancers, only exacerbated the problem of task definition. If the task was not clearly defined from the beginning it was hard to make changes during the course of the project. In order to address these issues, we have made a number of recommendations, all which come back to the issue of responsible use, which was the most prevalent of all of the issues that clients faced. Recently the plight of the workers in the on-demand economy has received much attention from the media and academics alike. We agree that workers should have better benefits and more rights. We argue that creating a marketplace with a more equal power dynamic between clients and freelancers would also help freelancers and is not mutually exclusive or at odds with efforts such as unionizing freelancers or changing legislation. Companies and platforms have the power to create a more equal power dynamic, and we urge them to take our suggestions into consideration. We also urge the CSCW community to broaden its research to further examine the freelance economy and the experiences of clients."
Parallel Journeys of Patients with Cancer and Depression: Challenges and Opportunities for Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392843,"Depression is common but under-treated in patients with cancer, despite being a major modifiable contributor to morbidity and early mortality. Integrating psychosocial care into cancer services through the team-based Collaborative Care Management (CoCM) model has been proven to be effective in improving patient outcomes in cancer centers. However, there is currently a gap in understanding the challenges that patients and their care team encounter in managing co-morbid cancer and depression in integrated psycho-oncology care settings. Our formative study examines the challenges and needs of CoCM in cancer settings with perspectives from patients, care managers, oncologists, psychiatrists, and administrators, with a focus on technology opportunities to support CoCM. We find that: (1) patients with co-morbid cancer and depression struggle to navigate between their cancer and psychosocial care journeys, and (2) conceptualizing co-morbidities as separate and independent care journeys is insufficient for characterizing this complex care context. We then propose the parallel journeys framework as a conceptual design framework for characterizing challenges that patients and their care team encounter when cancer and psychosocial care journeys interact. We use the challenges discovered through the lens of this framework to highlight and prioritize technology design opportunities for supporting whole-person care for patients with co-morbid cancer and depression. The integration of psychosocial services in cancer care is crucial in supporting the whole patient, and yet challenges rooted in cancer-centric views continue to prevent patients with cancer and depression from receiving adequate care. We introduce the parallel journeys framework to characterize patient experiences in simultaneously navigating the cancer care journey and the psychosocial care journey. The framework helps reveal challenges at the seams of the two journeys and helps surface related technology opportunities. We encourage health technology researchers, designers, and healthcare providers to consider both cancer care journeys and psychosocial care journeys in their future design of technologies for patients with cancer and depression."
Real-Time Interruption Management System for Efficient Distributed Collaboration in Multi-tasking Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392844,"Interruption dissemination in proactive systems remains a challenge for efficient human-machine collaboration, especially in real-time distributed collaborative environments. In this paper a real-time interruption management system (IMS) is proposed that leverages speech information, the most commonly used and available means of communication within collaborative distributed environments. The key aspect of this paper includes a proposed real-time IMS system that leverages lexical affirmation cues to infer the end of a task or task boundary as a candidate interruption time. The performance results show the proposed real-time lexical Affirmation Cues based Interruption Management System (ACE-IMS) outperforms the current baseline real-time IMS system within the existing literature. ACE-IMS has the potential of reducing disruptive interruptions without incurring excessive missed opportunities to disseminate interruptions by utilizing only the most frequently used mode of human communication: voice. Thereby, providing a promising new baseline to further the system development of real-time interruption management systems within the ever-growing distributed collaborative domain. Ill-timed interruptions disrupt the ongoing task and degrade human productivity and affective state, which poses a serious threat, especially in distributed multi-user multiâtasking interactions. To address this challenge, this paper proposed ACE-IMS, an adaptive and real-time interruption management system that utilizes typical affirmation cues present in human-human communication to construct a highly effective and efficient solution for disseminating interruptions at task-boundary. This work, motivated by the observation that affirmation cues are present in majority of task-boundary utterances in taskâoriented dialogues, demonstrated that affirmation cues can be leveraged in a real-time IMS to effectively control and disseminate interruptions in order to mitigate the challenges imposed by disruptive interruptions. The proposed solution has the potential to improve the effort in growing field of computer-supported distributed collaborations that strive to augment human cognitive capability with computational and sensory power of machines, while suppressing the risk of cognitive overload. Thus, the resulting cooperative teaming between humans and machines paves way for a new wave of human-machine teaming applications in stressful distributed multi-tasking environments, such as: emergency and disaster management, law enforcement, telemedicine, and other field operations."
Conformity of Eating Disorders through Content Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392845,"For individuals with mental illness, social media platforms are considered spaces for sharing and connection. However, not all expressions of mental illness are treated equally on these platforms. Different aggregates of human and technical control are used to report and ban content, accounts, and communities. Through two years of digital ethnography, including online observation and interviews, with people with eating disorders, we examine the experience of content moderation. We use a constructivist grounded theory approach to analysis that shows how practices of moderation across different platforms have particular consequences for members of marginalized groups, who are pressured to conform and compelled to resist. Above all, we argue that platform moderation is enmeshed with wider processes of conformity to specific versions of mental illness. Practices of moderation reassert certain bodies and experiences as 'normal' and valued, while rejecting others. At the same time, navigating and resisting these normative pressures further inscribes the marginal status of certain individuals. We discuss changes to the ways that platforms handle content related to eating disorders by drawing on the concept of multiplicity to inform design. Practices of content moderation are integral to what social media platforms do. However, they are far from perfect and increasingly difficult to get right. Despite good intentions, practices of moderation have consequences for individuals with eating disorders and other members of marginalized groups. These consequences include loss of personal content and community support and labor associated with practices of resistance. In this paper, we examine the experience of content moderation and how, in particular, mechanisms of content moderation (e.g., the sociotechnical relations involved in content removal, quarantine, helpline resources) work to establish and enforce a conformity to body image and body management on social media. We argue that processes of conformity as reproduced through sociotechnical structures afforded by platforms work to exclude people with eating disorders and other non-normative identities and experiences. Additionally, our work raises the question of who or what gets to decide which experiences and narratives are acceptable for online participation. Rather than design for restrictive content moderation practices, we suggest that platforms consider supporting a diversity of eating disorder and illness experiences by designing for multiplicity."
Do Multilingual Users Prefer Chat-bots that Code-mix? Let's Nudge and Find Out!,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392846,"Despite their pervasiveness, current text-based conversational agents (chatbots) are predominantly monolingual, while users are often multilingual. It is well-known that multilingual users mix languages while interacting with others, as well as in their interactions with computer systems (such as query formulation in text-/voice-based search interfaces and digital assistants). Linguists refer to this phenomenon as code-mixing or code-switching. Do multilingual users also prefer chatbots that can respond in a code-mixed language over those which cannot? In order to inform the design of chatbots for multilingual users, we conduct a mixed-method user-study (N=91) where we examine how conversational agents, that code-mix and reciprocate the users' mixing choices over multiple conversation turns, are evaluated and perceived by bilingual users. We design a human-in-the-loop chatbot with two different code-mixing policies -- (a) always code-mix irrespective of user behavior, and (b) nudge with subtle code-mixed cues and reciprocate only if the user, in turn, code-mixes. These two are contrasted with a monolingual chatbot that never code-mixed. Users are asked to interact with the bots, and provide ratings on perceived naturalness and personal preference. They are also asked open-ended questions around what they (dis)liked about the bots. Analysis of the chat logs, users' ratings, and qualitative responses reveal that multilingual users strongly prefer chatbots that can code-mix. We find that self-reported language proficiency is the strongest predictor of user preferences. Compared to the Always code-mix policy, Nudging emerges as a low-risk low-gain policy which is equally acceptable to all users. Nudging as a policy is further supported by the observation that users who rate the code-mixing bot higher typically tend to reciprocate the language mixing pattern of the bot. These findings present a first step towards developing conversational systems that are more human-like and engaging by virtue of adapting to the users' linguistic style. Our key findings are that systems that explicitly reason about the extent of code-mixing in their replies, independent of content, fare better in terms of user evaluations with bilingual users. Through a mixed-method user study, we comprehensively analyze the effects of user demographics, expressed attitudes, and language proficiency on evaluations of CM chatbots. Our contributions include a new syntactic schema for sentence-level code-mixing, and an online policy formulation to gradually incorporate any graded style dimension into a conversation based on mutual reciprocation. We also emphasize the utility of adaptively estimating hidden user preferences in cases where they are not known a priori, using insights from work on Communication Accommodation Theory. Finally, demonstrate the utility of incorporating linguistic style into dialog planning, through the proposed strategy of ânudgingâ. We thus present a step towards developing more responsive, natural and human-like conversational systems that move beyond just considerations of content and take into account the linguistic style choices of users."
Moving Across Lands: Online Platform Migration in Fandom Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392847,"When online platforms rise and fall, sometimes communities fade away, and sometimes they pack their bags and relocate to a new home. To explore the causes and effects of online community migration, we examine transformative fandom, a longstanding, technology-agnostic community surrounding the creation, sharing, and discussion of creative works based on existing media. For over three decades, community members have left and joined many different online spaces, from Usenet to Tumblr to platforms of their own design. Through analysis of 28 in-depth interviews and 1,886 survey responses from fandom participants, we traced these migrations, the reasons behind them, and their impact on the community. Our findings highlight catalysts for migration that provide insights into factors that contribute to success and failure of platforms, including issues surrounding policy, design, and community. Further insights into the disruptive consequences of migrations (such as social fragmentation and lost content) suggest ways that platforms might both support commitment and better support migration when it occurs. As our digital communities grow more and more complex, we should try to better understand what connects an online community beyond the platform where it is embodied. Communities rarely emerge in a vacuum, carrying with them a history of previous relationships and community memberships [53]. Fandom is a unique domain with which to study this phenomenon, since the community has existed across so many different online spaces over a very long period of time, demonstrating how communities can exist separate from and across platforms simultaneously, and ultimately survive beyond them. Our findings about platform migration suggest common motivations for leaving as well as joining, and suggest that policy and values based problems can be particularly important, but that these alone may not be enough to inspire a mass exodus. Just as a ânew and sparklyâ alternative can draw people away from a platform that is serving them well, that same viable alternative must be available to draw them in. Subsequently, the network effects that occur when users follow their friends and communities (or flee empty shopping malls) can lead to a new platform becoming a home. Why donât people just leave Facebook, in the wake of so many complaints about it? The same reason fans donât just leave Tumblr. They need somewhere to go first, and that place must importantly support both their technical and their community needs. In other words, without a good enough place to go, migration becomes a collective action problem. One of the lessons of this work is how one might make that alternative good enough, an accounting for what factors contribute to viable alternatives and successful migrations, as illustrated by data about thousands of individual moves across platforms. These findings have the potential to assist platform designers in mitigating the challenges of users leaving and joining new platforms.

"Changing Roles and Contexts: Symbolic Interactionism in the Sharing of Food and Eating Practices between Remote, Intergenerational Family Members",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392848,"Cooking and eating together is a prominent social experience amongst families. Older adults and their adult children who live apart often communicate about these experiences to stay aware of each other's health and wellbeing. In this paper, we examine current practices surrounding the communication of eating habits and meal preparation between older adults and their adult children living apart. We interviewed 18 older parents and nine adult children to understand their experiences. While most participants found the sharing of eating experiences to be rewarding and enlightening of family health behaviors, family roles and contexts could create tensions around this type of conversation. Applying the lens of symbolic interactionism theory, we examine how changing roles and contexts influence the conversation of eating and meal preparation and how participants manage tensions. We discuss future design opportunities to support family collaboration around food and eating, accounting for the transition of roles and contexts. Eating and meal preparation are social practices. Sharing these experiences and practices among family members living apart from each other has the potential to create connectedness and improve wellbeing. Reflecting on the results from the interview of 18 older parents and nine adult children who live apart from their family members, this research provides an empirical understanding of what, why, and how people share or not share eating and meal preparation experiences and practices. To encourage the sharing of these experiences and the management of tensions, future systems should acknowledge and support dynamic roles and contexts. These systems should consider the integration of family goals and individual goals, the creation of shared experiences, and how this might influence family interactions."
Trustworthiness Perceptions of Social Media Resources Named after a Crisis Event,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392849,"People often create social media accounts and pages named after crisis events. We call such accounts and pages Crisis Named Resources (CNRs). CNRs share information about crisis events and are followed by many. Yet, they also appear suddenly (at crisis onset) and in most cases, the owners are unknown. Thus, it can be challenging for audiences in particular to know whether to trust (or not trust) these CNRs and the information they provide. In this study, we conducted surveys and interviews with members of the public and experts in crisis informatics, emergency response, and communication studies to evaluate the trustworthiness of CNRs named after the 2017 Hurricane Irma. Findings showed that participants evaluated trustworthiness based on their perceptions of a CNR's content, information source, profile, and owner. Findings also show that if people perceive that a CNR owner has prior experience in crisis response, can help the public to respond to the event, understands the situation, has the best interests of affected individuals in mind, or will correct misinformation, they tend to trust that CNR. Participant demographics and expertise showed no effect on perceptions of trustworthiness. This study showed that factors that influence the perceived trustworthiness of CNRs fall under the broad categories of CNR content, information source, profile, and owner. We found that participants tended to consider a CNR trustworthy if they perceive its content as relevant, of high quality, adequate in quantity, timely, useful, and accurate, and if it contained media. Participants also trusted CNRs that either linked to authoritative and/or local sources or mentioned their information sources. Additionally, participants considered a CNR trustworthy if they perceived it to be professional, popular, authentic, and with a crisis-related purpose. Lastly, participants tended to trust CNRs if they perceived that its owners could help or had good intentions for crisis-affected individuals. This research also determines how people assess the trustworthiness of CNRs. Findings of this research show that if people perceive that a CNR owner has prior experience in crisis response, can help crisis-affected public to respond to the event, understands the situation, has the best interests of affected individuals in mind, or will correct misinformation that comes into his/her notice, they tend to trust that CNR. In contrast, if people feel that a CNR owner might share misinformation intentionally, they tend not to trust that CNR. No significant correlation between participants perceptions on the trustworthiness of CNRs and their demographics was found."
ImageSense: An Intelligent Collaborative Ideation Tool to Support Diverse Human-Computer Partnerships,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392850,"Professional designers create mood boards to explore, visualize, and communicate hard-to-express ideas. We present ImageCascade, an intelligent, collaborative ideation tool that combines individual and shared work spaces, as well as collaboration with multiple forms of intelligent agents. In the collection phase, ImageCascade offers fluid transitions between serendipitous discovery of curated images via ImageCascade, combined text- and image-based Semantic search, and intelligent AI suggestions for finding new images. For later composition and reflection, ImageCascade provides semantic labels, generated color palettes, and multiple tag clouds to help communicate the intent of the mood board. A study of nine professional designers revealed nuances in designers' preferences for designer-led, system-led, and mixed-initiative approaches that evolve throughout the design process. We discuss the challenges in creating effective human-computer partnerships for creative activities, and suggest directions for future research. We presented ImageSense, a collaborative, digital mood board design tool that supports collaboration between remote designers and offers intelligent tools for: serendipitous discovery of curated images from the ImageCascade, combined text- and image-based Semantic search, and intelligent AI suggestions to find new images. Our goal is to support human-computer partnership, allowing designers to share agency both with each other and with intelligent tools, creating diverse forms of collaboration that remain under the userâs control. ImageSense uses state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to provide active intelligent agents that contribute and adapt to the ideation process, under the designerâs control. By enriching images with semantic labels, ImageSense facilitates both semantic visual search and reflection, and provides opportunities for serendipitous exploration. Our research questions were to RQ1) explore new ways to seamlessly integrate contributions from both human and intelligent agents into a digital mood board; RQ2) identify the appropriate kinds of intelligent assistance for different types of ideation challenges; and RQ3) assess some of the differences in how designers interact with remote human collaborators and intelligent assistants, and how they can support each other. We addressed the first goal by creating a digital mood board tool that supports the entire ideation process, from early collection of ideas, to layout of visual material, to reflection and final presentation to stakeholders. The system is fully collaborative: remote designers can work together in a shared space, but each retain their own individual spaces and access to design tools. They can see each otherâs work progress, and propose and react to the remote designerâs images and reactions to their choices. ImageSense also incorporates three visual inspiration tools, each with a different type of agency. Designers control when to propose or seek suggestions or reactions, from both their human partners and intelligent agents. Designers can use these different tools without disrupting their creative flow. Most designers (8/9) reported that ImageSense helped them explore novel alternatives and to effectively communicate their designs to stakeholders. They also reported that ImageSense helped them reflect on both the composition and traceability of the process. Most agreed that ImageSense helped them to âcollect useful imagesâ (6/9) and âbe more creativeâ (5/9). To address the second and third research goals, our study identified situations under which participants preferred to work with a human designer or with each type of tool. Most designers said they would âlove to ownâ ImageCascade and Semantic Search when they were actively collecting images. ImageCascade was most useful when they needed to extend their ideas with images that are not directly related, but also not random. They particularly appreciated Semantic Search when they struggled to find search terms for hard-to-express visual ideas. Designers rated the AI suggestions as most suitable when they felt stuck or as an additional push to get started and extend their idea space, ignored it when they were browsing images with ImageCascade, or actively searching for images with Semantic Search. By contrast, designers found the human collaborator particularly helpful when they knew what they were looking for and for discussing content representation in the end. In each case, designers enjoyed being able to choose, minute-by-minute, the types of interactions they had with both human design partners and intelligent assistants. When we consider how best to integrate intelligent systems into any creative process, we need to consider just what it means for the user to remain in control of the interaction. Clearly, this does not have a single answer, but depends greatly on the userâs situation in the moment. When designers have a clear idea of what they want and how to express it, they require different types of interaction with intelligent tools than if they are completely at a loss and need surprising, but relevant new ideas. ImageSense demonstrates how to integrate different forms of intelligent assistance to create varied human-computer partnerships within the same collaborative, creativity support platform, and, we hope, serves as inspiration for future creativity support tools."
"Exploring Photography in Rural Kenyan Households: Considering ""Relational Objects"" in CSCW and HCI",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392852,"Domestic and personal photography are topics of longstanding interest to CSCW and HCI researchers. In this paper, we explore these topics in Bungoma County, Kenya. We used interview and observation methods to investigate how photographs are taken, displayed, organized, and shared, in 23 rural households. To more deeply understand participants' photography practices, we also gave them digital cameras, observed what they did with them, and asked them to engage in a photo-elicitation exercise. Our findings draw attention to the ways photographs are ""relational objects"" - that is, material objects that support the maintenance, reproduction, and transformation of social relations. We then describe these relations: economic (i.e., working as cameramen producing and distributing printed images); family (i.e., parents and children using printed images to tell family histories); and community (i.e., people using printed images to present an idealized self). The introduction of digital cameras into these households did not appear to change these practices; instead, it reinforced them. We discuss how considering relational objects in CSCW/HCI is useful for balancing the technologically determinist perspectives that are the basis of many prior studies of photography in these fields. In particular, we detail how considering the concept provides new perspectives on materiality, as well an alternative to the individualistic perspective, which underlies these communities' understanding of photography. We present a novel case study exploring how photographs are taken, organized, displayed, and shared in rural households in Bungoma County, Kenya. Our findings demonstrate the value of studying photographic practices across cultures, in particular for drawing attention to relational objectsâa topic that merits more consideration in CSCW/HCI. Our research demonstrates the value of introducing new concepts into the CSCW/HCI communitiesâin particular, our use of relational objects to frame our research. This concept is considered useful for understanding photographic practices in non-Western settings. More broadly, our research draws attention to the variations in technology use that have not been fully considered in prior research. We encourage CSCW/HCI researchers to be receptive to unexpected ideas (e.g., the continued significance of printed images) and to different cultural norms (e.g., prioritizing relational practices over individualized ones). This means avoiding generalizing perspectives about personal and domestic photography practicesâwhich can lean towards technological determinismâand considering situated perspectives which can emerge from studying these practices in rural Kenya."
Emotional Amplification During Live-Streaming: Evidence from Comments During and After News Events,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392853,"Live streaming services allow people to concurrently consume and comment on media events with other people in real time. Durkheim's theory of ""collective effervescence"" suggests that face-to-face encounters in ritual events conjure emotional arousal, so people often feel happier and more excited while watching events like the Super Bowl with family and friends through the television than if they were alone. Does a stronger emotional intensity also occur in live streaming? Using a large-scale dataset of comments posted to news and media events on YouTube, we address this question by examining emotional intensity in live comments versus those produced retrospectively. Results reveal that live comments are overall more emotionally intense than retrospective comments across all temporal periods and all event types examined. Findings support the emotional amplification hypothesis and provide preliminary evidence for shared attention theory in explaining the amplification effect. These findings have important implications for live streaming platforms to optimize resources for content moderation and to improve psychological well-being for content moderators, and more broadly as society grapples with using technology to stay connected during social distancing required by the COVID-19 pandemic. Live streaming fosters co-presence and social interaction in everyday viewing practices, creating a mediated co-viewing experience. Our work, using an observational analysis of large-scale text data, reveals that emotions experienced together with others during live streaming are more intense than emotions experienced individually after the live streaming. This emotional amplification effect is consistent across media events and time points. This effect is best explained by perceptual absorption as people process live media as predicted by shared attention theory. Our findings reveal emotional dynamics during and after live streaming, and highlight the urgency of further improving the live streaming platforms to strategically perform content moderation and improve the well-being for moderators. As the pandemic of COVID-19, which began in early 2020, and the practice of social distancing has made clear, understanding the emotional dynamics of live streaming as a practice for staying connected via technology is increasingly important."
Measuring Misinformation in Video Search Platforms: An Audit Study on YouTube,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392854,"Search engines are the primary gateways of information. Yet, they do not take into account the credibility of search results. There is a growing concern that YouTube, the second largest search engine and the most popular video-sharing platform, has been promoting and recommending misinformative content for certain search topics. In this study, we audit YouTube to verify those claims. Our audit experiments investigate whether personalization (based on age, gender, geolocation, or watch history) contributes to amplifying misinformation. After shortlisting five popular topics known to contain misinformative content and compiling associated search queries representing them, we conduct two sets of audits-Search-and Watch-misinformative audits. Our audits resulted in a dataset of more than 56K videos compiled to link stance (whether promoting misinformation or not) with the personalization attribute audited. Our videos correspond to three major YouTube components: search results, Up-Next, and Top 5 recommendations. We find that demographics, such as, gender, age, and geolocation do not have a significant effect on amplifying misinformation in returned search results for users with brand new accounts. On the other hand, once a user develops a watch history, these attributes do affect the extent of misinformation recommended to them. Further analyses reveal a filter bubble effect, both in the Top 5 and Up-Next recommendations for all topics, except vaccine controversies; for these topics, watching videos that promote misinformation leads to more misinformative video recommendations. In conclusion, YouTube still has a long way to go to mitigate misinformation on its platform. In this study, we conducted two sets of audit experiments on YouTube platform to empirically determine the effect of personalization attributes (age, gender, geolocation and watch history) on the amount of misinformation prevalent in YouTube searches and recommendations. Our audits resulted in a dataset of 56,475 videos that we annotated for their stance (promoting, neutral and debunking) and relevance towards the misinformative search topics. We found that the personalization attributes affect the amount of misinformation in recommendations once the user develops a watch history. Our study also suggests that YouTube is modifying its search and recommendation algorithm for certain misinformative topics like vaccine controversies. Our audit methodologies can be used for investigating other search engines for misinformative search results and recommendations. We believe such audit studies will inform the need for building search engines that retrieve and present results ranked according to both relevance and credibility."
"""(We) Can Talk It Out..."": Designing for Promoting Conflict-Resolution Skills in Youth on a Moderated Minecraft Server",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392855,"Online multiplayer games like Minecraft, gaining increasing popularity among present-day youth, include rich contexts for social interactions but are also rife with interpersonal conflict among players. Research shows that a variety of socio-technical mechanisms (e.g., server rules, chat filters, use of in-game controls to ban players, etc.) aim to limit and/or eliminate social conflict in games like Minecraft. However, avoiding social conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach. Broadly defined in CSCW literature as a phenomenon that may arise even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g., [Easterbrook et al.,1993]). In fact, the aforementioned approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal differences that may occur in other social settings. Furthermore, prior research has established the value of developing conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention interventions (e.g.,[Shure, 1982], [Aber et al., 1998]), for later success in any given interpersonal relationship. While games like Minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions within online interest-driven settings. Drawing from prior literature in CSCW, youth wellness and prevention programs, we translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated Minecraft server. The online program, titled Survival Lab, was designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). We conducted a field study for six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators, and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. Our study data reveals that participating youth created community norms and developed insightful solutions to conflicts in Survival Lab. Our research offers three key takeaways. Firstly, online social games like Minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social competencies among youth. Secondly, the design features that support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are viable for collective or community-level outcomes. Third and finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play a vital role in facilitating the development of conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among youth. We discuss the implications of our research for translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites and conclude with recommendations for future work. Youth are increasingly engaging in online social activities that including playing games like social Minecraft. Research shows that current approaches in games like Minecraft avoid or eliminate social conflict to suppress deviant group behaviors. However, youth need opportunities to practice and grow their ability to solve social conflict within safe contexts so they can overcome interpersonal problems and better understand how to cooperate with others. Research in CSCW offers a wealth of knowledge on conflict resolution that is an inherent part of any collaboration and everyday social interactions. Adjacent disciplines in youth wellness, Positive Psychology, and Prevention Science programs offer a rich evidence-base for alternative design strategies known to work in offline/in-person settings. Building on CSCW research, our work explores an alternative view of social conflict (i.e. that can occur whether or not mutual cooperation exists) within an online multiplayer game for youth. We translated offline evidence-based strategies into an online afterschool program that was run within a moderated Minecraft server. The program was designed to maximize social conflict and individual agency for youth (ages 8-14 years). To our surprise, our analysis of data from a six month field study (30 youth participants, 4 college-age moderators, and 1 high-school community volunteer) revealed that youth not only engaged with the programâs design features to problem-solve conflicts they experienced, but also drew on community norms that youth themselves had authored in Survival Lab. Our tracesâ data revealed only three major conflicts over a six-month time period, all of which were resolved through discussion in an amicable manner. While further research is necessary to formally evaluate our design, our work in this paper offers the promise for designers, researchers, and practitioners to expand contexts in Minecraft aimed at promoting pro-social development in youth. Our research suggests that online play-based settings can be viable sites to rapidly and iteratively build, evaluate and scale behavioral interventions for youth, thereby addressing some of the challenges faced by traditional offline interventions."
Successful Online Socialization: Lessons from the Wikipedia Education Program,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392857,"Attracting and retaining newcomers is critical and challenging for online production communities such as Wikipedia, both because volunteers need specialized training and are likely to leave before being integrated into the community. In response to these challenges, the Wikimedia Foundation started the Wiki Education Project (Wiki Ed), an online program in which college students edit Wikipedia articles as class assignments. The Wiki Ed program incorporates many components of institutional socialization, a process many conventional organizations successfully use to integrate new employees through formalized on-boarding practices. Research has not adequately investigated whether Wiki Ed and similar programs are effective ways to integrate volunteers in online communities, and, if so, the mechanisms involved. This paper evaluates the Wiki Ed program by comparing 16,819 student editors in 770 Wiki Ed classes with new editors who joined Wikipedia in the conventional way. The evaluation shows that the Wiki Ed students did more work, improved articles more, and were more committed to Wikipedia. For example, compared to new editors who joined Wikipedia in the conventional way they were twice as likely to still be editing Wikipedia a year after their Wiki Ed class was finished. Further, students in classrooms that encouraged joint activity, a key component of institutional socialization, produced better quality work than those in classrooms where students worked independently. These findings are consistent with an interpretation that the Wiki Ed program was successful because it incorporated elements of institutionalized socialization."
C-Reference: Improving 2D to 3D Object Pose Estimation Accuracy via Crowdsourced Joint Object Estimation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392858,"Converting widely-available 2D images and videos, captured using an RGB camera, to 3D can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. However, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only accurately estimating object location and orientation, but also requires knowing currently unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). A scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3D object properties. Unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3D properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3D perception (i.e., humans do not ""see"" depth like a laser range finder). In this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3D state of a single target object. Our approach can generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding various different objects that share a spatial relationship with the target object. We evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that our method can reduce errors in the target object's 3D location estimation by over 40%, while requiring only $35$% as much human time. Our work introduces a novel way to enable groups of people with different perspectives and knowledge to achieve more accurate collective performance on challenging visual annotation tasks. This paper presents the design, implementation and assessment of C-Reference, a system that collects heterogeneous annotations of various different objects and jointly aggregates such annotations to accurately estimate the 3D location of a target object in a 2D image. Through a controlled characterization study, we investigated the potential performance benefit of our joint object annotation aggregation method that harnesses C-Reference. Based on the study results, we implemented a system, C-Reference, that collects diverse object measurement approximations from crowd workers. Using our proposed method, the annotations from crowd workers could be transformed into a soft constraint for an optimizer, penalizing infeasible solutions and encouraging the optimizer to find a better solution based on the collective annotations. Our results show that C-Referenceâs improves the quality of 3D location estimation of objects by more than 40% while requiring only 35% as much human time. More broadly, our work proposes a new approach to leveraging contextually relevant information from different objects to more accurately compute target object estimation."
Data Analysts and Their Software Practices: A Profile of the Sabermetrics Community and Beyond,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392859,"For modern data analytics, practices from software development are increasingly necessary to manage data, but they must be incorporated alongside other statistical and scientific skills. Therefore, we ask: how does a community recontextualize software development through the unique pressures of their work? To answer this, we explore the analytic community around baseball, or sabermetrics. To discover software development's place in the search for robust statistical insight in sports, we interview 10 participants in the sabermetric community and survey over 120 more data analysts, both in baseball and not. We explore how their work lives at the intersection of science and entertainment, and as a consequence, baseball data serves as an accessible yet deep subject to practice analytic skills. Software development exists within an iterative research process that cycles between defining rigorous statistical methods and preserving the flexibility to chase interesting problems. In this question-driven process, members of the community inhabit several overlapping roles of intentional work, in which software development can become the priority to support research and statistical infrastructure, and we discuss the way that the community can foster the balance of these skills. In this study, we explored a community of data analysts and their work at the intersection of analytics and software development. We chose baseball analytics as our subject because of its unique positioning as a cultural, historical, and academic field: with more than a century of public interest and development, it offers extensive datasets with expansive and passionate conversation around it. In order to supplement theories of what development work looks like, we conducted interviews and surveys that inquired about participantsâ individual practices in developing software to fulfill their goals. Our results emphasize the diverse nature of a community defined more by a shared interest than a uniform approach to analytic or development work. Though the responsibilities of a sabermetrician support general analysis by definition, it constitutes a number of specializationsâin development and data curation, for exampleâthat allow for different academic backgrounds and interests to apply new frames for work. Whatever the case, the differences between individuals is mitigated by what sabermetricians share: a passion for the sport of baseball and its statistical language, extensive historical datasets, and physical and virtual communities where hobbyists and professionals alike can support or debate research. These resources make it possible for analysts, for baseball and in general, to practice skills productively through personal projects and to find supportive peers or communities. We also find that the analytic posture has definite effects on the software development cycle: analysts must balance flexibility in finding interesting questions while nevertheless being rigorous with the scientific method in responsibly carrying through from data to insight. Still, there remains work in overcoming barriers in construction and testing that result, in part, from a lack of shared community practice. Therefore, as researchers and practitioners continue to develop better interdisciplinary resources, we acknowledge the potential in this community to capitalize on its particular position between science and entertainment as it continues to evolve."
Topical Focus of Political Campaigns and its Impact: Findings from Politicians' Hashtag Use during the 2019 Indian Elections,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392860,"We studied the topical preferences of social media campaigns of India's two main political parties by examining the tweets of 7382 politicians during the key phase of campaigning between Jan - May of 2019 in the run up to the 2019 general election. First, we compare the use of self-promotion and opponent attack, and their respective success online by categorizing 1208 most commonly used hashtags accordingly into the two categories. Second, we classify the tweets applying a qualitative typology to hashtags on the subjects of nationalism, corruption, religion and development. We find that the ruling BJP tended to promote itself over attacking the opposition whereas the main challenger INC was more likely to attack than promote itself. Moreover, while the INC gets more retweets on average, the BJP dominates Twitter's trends by flooding the online space with large numbers of tweets. We consider the implications of our findings hold for political communication strategies in democracies across the world. In conclusion, this research shows empirically what has often been argued anecdotally by commentators, that the election has seen a nationalistic shift by the BJP. It is important to situate this within the larger context of Indian politics in the last decade, since the BJP came to power eschewing its traditional right-wing Hindu-politics narrative and instead focusing on development and anti-corruption. As a party in power, attempting to defend itself, the turn to nationalism as well as religion underlines the partyâs recognition of emotional sectarian appeals as valuable at the votebanks. While there are nuances specific to Indian politics, the case of an incumbent, being attacked on corruption and development, turning to nationalistic and sectarian politics holds warnings for political movements worldwide. The successes in this lean towards a political enemy, rather than a policy offering, are portentous in an international political environment in which nation states increasingly see heightening amounts of polarization."
Toward a Grassroots Culture of Technology Practice,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392862,"Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can support grassroots social movements toward greateroutreach and better day-to-day communication. In this paper, we present the results of action research with alarge-scale grassroots social movement, the Southern Movement Assembly (SMA), exploring their uses andperceptions of ICTs. We find that the ICTs chosen by the SMA are often at odds with their grassroots cultureof inclusion and participation-which results in inequitable sociotechnical realities within the movement. Forexample, people with technical skills gain more power as they start to control organizational processes. Astechnical skills are most commonly associated with racial, gender, and socioeconomic privileges, this leads toinequitable participation. We conclude by calling for a grassroots culture of technology practice rooted inanalyses of systemic exclusion with a continuous effort to center the marginalized voices and experienceswith technology. Imagine telling a grassroots organizer thirty years ago that in the future they would have low-cost or even free access to audio and video conferencing, shared document editing, and the means to publicize events to thousands of people with a few mouse clicks. They would, rightly, be amazed and excited. The existence of these technologies is what makes a regional movement like SMA possible. Technology has come a long way toward helping the voices of people be heard. However, these technologies also have unexpected consequences. It doesnât much help to have a meeting via audio conferencing so people without computers can attend if the meeting is announced via email. Small barriers like this accumulate, making true democracy hard to achieve. Even grassroots organizations who rank democratic participation of the marginalized as a top value struggle to be fully inclusive in their daily practices. Awareness of the problem is an important first step, but not a sufficient one, since careful analysis of available technological tools often leads to hard trade offs. We suggest that there is work to be done in CSCW and broader HCI toward critically examining both the fundamental values we produce and market our technologies with as well as the consequences of such value-laden technologies. As a possible shift in the means of ICT design and production, we suggest CSCW and HCI designers draw from the culture (practices, beliefs, artifacts described throughout this paper) of grassroots inclusivityâa vision of inclusivity grounded in a structural analysis of exclusion. While we envision a more integrated technology practice in CSCW (and therefore more value-aligned ICTs) that accommodates grassroots needs, we argue that grassroots movements too have a role to play in making such an integration happen. Thus, we call for a localized culture of technology practice in grassroots communities that is committed to holding the cultures of ICT accountable for the values they embody and promote. We envision that a grassroots culture of technology practice will be rooted in the grassroots analysis of systemic exclusion with a continuous effort to include and center the marginalized voices and experiences with technology. In future work, we are doing sociotechnical systems design (both artifacts and social practices) toward that culture of technology, prioritizing grassroots inclusivity and other grassroots values. Further, our ongoing work with SMA also aims to create a handbook of movement communications, which we hope will be useful to other groups who would like to reflect on their own practices. Ultimately, with our ongoing and future work in CSCW and in grassroots communities, we remain committed to help facilitate a grassroots culture of technology practice."
Quantifying the Effect of Social Presence on Online Social Conformity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392863,"Social conformity occurs when individuals in group settings change their personal opinion to be in agreement with the majority's position. While recent literature frequently reports on conformity in online group settings, the causes for online conformity are yet to be fully understood. This study aims to understand how social presencei.e., the sense of being connected to others via mediated communication, influences conformity among individuals placed in online groups while answering subjective and objective questions. Acknowledging its multifaceted nature, we investigate three aspects of online social presence: user representation (generic vs.user-specific avatars), interactivity (discussion vs.no discussion ), and response visibility (public vs.private ). Our results show an overall conformity rate of 30% and main effects from task objectivity, group size difference between the majority and the minority, and self-confidence on personal answer. Furthermore, we observe an interaction effect between interactivity and response visibility, such that conformity is highest in the presence of peer discussion and public responses, and lowest when these two elements are absent. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings in designing online group settings, accounting for the effects of social presence on conformity. Recent literature on conformity has given a significant emphasis to its diverse manifestations in online settings [6, 43, 44, 56, 60, 67â69]. However, limited effort has been invested in understanding what triggers conformity in online settings. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of social presence (i.e., the awareness of and the sense of being connected to others via mediated communication [58]) on online conformity, while also accounting for the effects of majority group size, task objectivity, and self-confidence â well-known determinants of offline conformity. We manipulated the social presence facilitated by our study setup across three variables â user representation, interactivity, and response visibility â to investigate their combined effect on social conformity. Our results reveal that in addition to the expected effects from group size difference, task objectivity, and self-confidence, the interaction among certain aspects of social presence also play a vital role on online conformity behaviour. We note that higher levels of online social presence (in terms of interactivity and response visibility) heightens the susceptibility of users to normative influences in addition to the commonly observed informational influences, leading to higher conformity in online settings. We conclude with a discussion on what our findings imply for the design of online group settings. First, we emphasise that social presence can indeed be used to control conformity influences in online settings. Second, our results suggest that platform designers can manipulate the level of interactivity facilitated and the visibility of user actions to manage online social presence, which in turn could help regulate conformity influences. Thus, designers should pay special attention to the above aspects of social presence in order to encourage and shape user behaviour as desired in a given setting. We also highlight that the âcorrectâ level of social presence varies based on the requirement of the platform and thus should be determined after careful consideration of its pros and cons. Moreover, our findings emphasise that online users prefer user representations that can provide more user-specific information. However, as a substantial amount of literature investigating online user representations and stereotyping recommends otherwise [35, 36, 67], we suggest alternatives that provide a compromise between stronger user cues and stereotypical conformity. We encourage future work to investigate effects of other dimensions and variables of social presence, such as social context and communication style [62], on online conformity that can expand upon these implications."
Mitigating Exploitation: Indie Game Developers' Reconfigurations of Labor in Technology,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392864,"Much HCI research seeks to contribute to technological agendas that lead to more just and participative labor relations and practices, yet that research also raises concerns about forms of exploitation associated with them. In this paper, we explore how U.S. independent [indie] game developers' socio-technological practices inject forms of labor, capital, and production into the game development industry. Our findings highlight that indie game development 1) seeks to promote an alternative to business models of game development that depend on free and immaterial labor; 2) builds offline networks at different scales to develop collectives that can sustain their production; and 3) emphasizes how distributed collaboration, co-creation, and the use of free tools and middleware make game production more widely accessible. The research contributes to HCI research that seeks to explicate and mitigate emerging forms of exploitation enabled by new technologies and processes. Our critical review of indie developers' practices and strategies also extends the current conceptualization of labor and technology in CSCW. How can HCI address the tension between the increasing demand for more just and participative labor relations and practices and emerging forms of exploitation enabled by new technologies and processes? We have investigated U.S. indie game developersâ socio-technological practices regarding labor, capital, and production as an empirical basis for such discussions. Despite its niche technological stance, we see this community as a valuable sociotechnical instance that contributes to HCI studies on technology, work, and labor. Its mechanisms of free and immaterial labor, distributed collaboration, co-creation, collective visibility and innovation, newcomer-friendliness culture, and the identity as part of a counter movement against sexism in the gaming culture offer promising strategies to mitigate potential risks of exploitation of labor in technology. While acknowledging indie game developersâ aspirations, endeavors, and promising insights for designing for protecting labor, we highlight how studying and criticizing the indie communityâs view of labor and technology contributes to extending the current conceptualization of technology and labor in CSCW. We, therefore, believe that these insights worth recognition and replication in other communities seeking more just and participative labor relations and practices supported by emerging technologies. We also believe that these insights contribute to an emerging research agenda in CSCW. Such an agenda would especially focus on how the organization of work and labor significantly impacts what new technologies and processes we can build and produce, especially with regards to how funding, power structure, production models, and work atmosphere are constantly shaping our technological innovation."
Unpacking Sharing in the Peer-to-Peer Economy: The Impact of Shared Needs and Backgrounds on Ride-Sharing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392865,"In recent years, the peer-to-peer economy has grown exponentially, particularly in the ride-sharing sector. This growth has been accompanied by a muddying between the sharing and gig economy, and it has become unclear when an activity is sharing a resource vs. providing a service. To unpack this difference, we studied two successful carpooling groups (university students traveling home and commuting among professionals), which we contrast with previous literature on ride-hailing apps (e.g., Uber). The two communities that we studied differ in that: professionals, had more routine ride-sharing needs based on their commute; and students, arranged rides to return home for school breaks or long weekends. We detail how common needs and backgrounds impacted how carpoolers treated each other. Leveraging these findings, we outline design paths for both the sharing and gig economies to better realize the ideas of the sharing economy."
How We've Taught Algorithms to See Identity: Constructing Race and Gender in Image Databases for Facial Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392866,"Race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of classification in technical infrastructures-from the passport to social media. Facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. What facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. In this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. We found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. Further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. Instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. We discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. We posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. We conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications. Emerging research in the realm of FATE (fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics) has yielded unique insights in improving equity in facial analysis technologies. Specifically, researchers have called for increased engagement with critical scholarship [64] and complex realities of identity [18, 150]. Our study embraces these calls, adopting a critical sociohistorical perspective of race and gender classification to analyze current identity documentation practices in image databases. We examined (1) for what purposes are race and gender included in image databases; (2) what information about race and gender is implicit and what is explicit; (3) what sources are being used to define categories of race and gender; and (4) what annotation practices are being used to identify race and gender in images. To accomplish this, we analyzed 92 image databases popularly cited in facial analysis literature. We developed a codebook to examine how database authors described their definitions and annotation practices of race and gender. We found that the majority of database authors neither provided sources for which gender and/or race were derived, nor described the annotation practice of identifying race and/or gender in database images. While a small subset of newer image databases are aimed at increasing, in particular, racial diversity and engage more deeply with literature on race and gender identities, they still rely on moments of visible identification that could be used to augment sociohistorical practices of oppression if adopted inappropriately. We discussed the current state of the art in database construction: apolitical and obvious approaches that erase the subjective reality of external identifications. We highlighted the politicized history of race and gender identifications, including how facial analysis systems are being adapted to expand harmful and oppressive agendas. Throughout this discussion, we highlighted the role of visible difference, that otherwise erases the internal experiences of race and gender. We concluded with recommendations for improving approaches to database construction and documentation, including opportunities for authors to mitigate harm to subjects of facial analysis."
"It's the Wild, Wild West: Lessons Learned From IRB Members' Risk Perceptions Toward Digital Research Data",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392868,"Digital technology that is prevalent in people's everyday lives, including smart home devices, mobile apps and social media, increasingly lack regulations for how the user data can be collected, used or disseminated. The CSCW and the larger computing community continue to evaluate and understand the potential negative impacts of research involving digital technologies. As more research involves digital data, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) take on the difficult task of evaluating and determining risks--likelihood of potential harms--from digital research. Learning more about IRBs' role in concretizing harm and its likelihood will help us critically examine the current approach to regulating digital research, and has implications for how researchers can reflect on their own data practices. We interviewed 22 U.S.-based IRB members and found that, for the interviewees, ""being digital"" added a risk. Being digital meant increasing possibilities of confidentiality breach, unintended collection of sensitive information, and unauthorized data reuse. Concurrently, interviewees found it difficult to pinpoint the direct harms that come out of those risks. The ambiguous, messy, and situated contexts of digital research data did not fit neatly into current human subjects research protection protocols. We discuss potential solutions for understanding risks and harms of digital technology and implications for the responsibilities of the CSCW and the larger computing community in conducting digital research. IRB membersâ primary goal is to assess risks and benefits of a research study to regulate how research studies can be performed accordingly. By probing IRB membersâ thinking processes around how they determine risks of a research study using digital technology, our study revealed the complexities involved in assessing risks and harms of digital data. The findings revealed what IRB membersâ perceived increased risks might be in data âbeing digital.â However, their experiences around assessing the likelihood of harms remained largely unknown. The study further revealed the ambiguous, uncertain characteristics of regulating digital research. This finding gave insights to how researchers can reflect on their own data practices and what regulatory enforcement policies can be made to aid effective protection of individuals from harm. Our study is timely and presents concrete future steps in shaping the Wild, Wild West of digital data."
Privacy-Preserving Script Sharing in GUI-based Programming-by-Demonstration Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392869,"An important concern in end user development (EUD) is accidentally embedding personal information in program artifacts when sharing them. This issue is particularly important in GUI-based programming-by-demonstration (PBD) systems due to the lack of direct developer control of script contents. Prior studies reported that these privacy concerns were the main barrier to script sharing in EUD. We present a new approach that can identify and obfuscate the potential personal information in GUI-based PBD scripts based on the uniqueness of information entries with respect to the corresponding app GUI context. Compared with the prior approaches, ours supports broader types of personal information beyond explicitly pre-specified ones, requires minimal user effort, addresses the threat of re-identification attacks, and can work with third-party apps from any task domain. Our approach also recovers obfuscated fields locally on the script consumer's side to preserve the shared scripts' transparency, readability, robustness, and generalizability. Our evaluation shows that our approach (1) accurately identifies the potential personal information in scripts across different apps in diverse task domains; (2) allows end-user developers to feel comfortable sharing their own scripts; and (3) enables script consumers to understand the operation of shared scripts despite the obfuscated fields. This paper presents a new mechanism, called Pinalite, for identifying and obfuscating possible personal information in GUI-based PBD scripts based on the uniqueness of information entries in app GUIs. By collecting hashed samples of GUI screens from many users, Pinalite is able to determine if a piece of information is likely personal by estimating the probability that a user has seen this information when that the user has visited this screen in the app. Pinaliteâs approach can also replace the obfuscated fields in a shared script locally using the script consumerâs app GUI contents, preserving the transparency, readability, robustness and generalizability of the original script. The current version of Pinalite addresses the privacy-preserving sharing of individual scripts. We are currently exploring aggregating scripts for similar tasks from multiple users. This would allow us to collect data about task automation procedures on different phones in various environments, and create more robust scripts that can handle differences in target app versions, screen layouts, phone usage contexts and task parameters. Prior to the introduction of an effective privacypreserving mechanism, we cannot collect runtime data of GUI-based PBD systems which contain actual script contents in the background, since the contents may contain the script authorâs personal information. With Pinalite, it may be feasible to extract runtime data of GUI-based PBD systems in the background, which would allow the PBD system to collect more data for aggregation purposes. We also plan to conduct a larger-scale field deployment of Pinalite. Through that study, we can test whether our approach in fact promotes script sharing behaviors in real usage. We will also study how script authors actually use Pinalite to obfuscate personal information in scripts for the purpose of sharing. Another interesting future research direction is to better communicate with the script authors and the script users about the data they may share and the privacy expectations associated with sharing these data. This should help users become more comfortable with participating in the background data collection and sharing their scripts, while making informed decisions on whether to share a script and whether to mask/unmask a field in a shared script at the script review stage. We hope to investigate this topic as a part of our planned field deployment."
Supporting Storytelling With Evidence in Holistic Review Processes: A Participatory Design Approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392870,"Review processes involve complex and often subjective decision-making tasks in which individual reviewers must read and rate submissions, such as a college application, along many relevant dimensions and typically with a rubric in mind. A common part of the work is committee review, where individual reviewers meet to discuss the merits of a particular submission in order to recommend an accept or reject decision. Prior work indicates that visualization and sensemaking support may be beneficial in such processes where reviewers must present the ""story"" of the applicant under question. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with reviewers in the domain of holistic college admissions to better understand the challenges and opportunities regarding storytelling. Based on these workshops, we contribute a characterization for how reviewers in this domain construct visual stories, we provide guidance for designing for evidence capture and storytelling, and we draw parallels and distinctions between this domain and other reviewing domains. To conclude, we expanded on prior field work [37] to explore more deeply the role of storytelling in the holistic admissions domain. Through three participatory design workshops, we discovered commonalities and differences in how stories are composed and told and characterized these stories using categorizations from existing literature on visual narratives. Through co-design iterations with a college admissions team, we explored possible Decision Sheet redesigns for incorporating storytelling and learned about how they could impact the holistic review process. Finally, we provide design suggestions and future research directions regarding storytelling and evidence capture in review processes."
Configuring Audiences: A Case Study of Email Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392871,"When people communicate with each other, their choice of what to say is tied to their perceptions of the audience. For many communication channels, people have some ability to explicitly specify their audience members and the different roles they can play. While existing accounts of communication behavior have largely focused on how people tailor the content of their messages, we focus on the configuring of the audience as a complementary family of decisions in communication. We formulate a general description of audience configuration choices, highlighting key aspects of the audience that people could configure to reflect a range of communicative goals. We then illustrate these ideas via a case study of email usage-a realistic domain where audience configuration choices are particularly fine-grained and explicit in how email senders fill the To and Cc address fields. In a large collection of enterprise emails, we explore how people configure their audiences, finding salient patterns relating a sender's choice of configuration to the types of participants in the email exchange, the content of the message, and the nature of the subsequent interactions. Our formulation and findings show how analyzing audience configurations can enrich and extend existing accounts of communication behavior, and frame research directions on audience configuration decisions in communication and collaboration."
"Using Cultural Probes in HCI4D/ICTD: A Design Case Study from Bungoma, Kenya",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392873,"Cultural probes have long been used in HCI to provide designers with glimpses into the local cultures for which they are designing, and thereby inspire novel design proposals. HCI4D/ICTD researchers are increasingly interested in more deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly related to socioeconomic development, and in considering new design approaches. However, few use this subjective, design-led method in their research. In this paper, I present a case study detailing my experience designing and deploying cultural probes in Bungoma, Kenya. Returns from my comment cards and digital camera activities draw attention to probe recipients' unique experiences and to Bungoma's distinctive characteristics; they also inspired a series of speculative design proposals. My experience motivates a discussion that elaborates on how a cultural probes approach can benefit HCI4D/ICTD research by raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit of a single solution in design. More broadly, I offer a case study demonstrating an alternative way to approach design in HCI4D/ICTD. I present a personal account of my experience using cultural probes in Bungoma County, Kenya. My exploration into using the method in rural Kenya seemed successful. This conclusion is based on the richness and diversity of the hundreds of photographs participants took, the stories and design proposals that emerged from my interactions with them, and the ongoing conversations between myself and the probe recipients. I presented a few of the probe returns here, and will explore other ways to disseminate them (e.g., a website). I anticipate learning more about the important issues affecting participantsâ interactions with technology when I share my design workbook with them upon my return to their homes. This case study is just one account; I acknowledge that another personâs experience would be different, as would my use of the approach elsewhere in Kenya. A person who is more fluent in Swahili, may have written the probe activities in that language. If I was conducting research in, for example, Siaya County, I would consider using Dholuo (the language which is more commonly spoken there) when developing probe activities. If my project was being carried out in an urban area, such as Nairobi, I may have relied on the postal service to deliver the probe returns to me, because it tends to be more reliable there than in Bungoma. Similarly, the returns that would emerge from deploying probes elsewhere, and with different people, would be different than those I received, as would someone elseâs interpretation of them, and the design concepts they would inspire. Herein lies another benefit of using cultural probes in HCI4D/ICT4D, it draws attention to these important, but often overlooked differences in countries, and in how researchers respond to them. My conclusion is that greater use of cultural probes has much to offer HCI4D/ICT4D, especially for the ways they acknowledge the subjectivity, bias, complexity, and emotion that is inherent (and unavoidable) in research. My hope is that embracing these factors can inject more creativity into how research is conducted in developing regions, and into the technologies designed for them, promote challenging discussions about the nature of HCI4D/ICTD research and how it is conducted, and prompt these communities to take seriously alternative forms of knowledge in design."
Exposing Error in Poverty Management Technology: A Method for Auditing Government Benefits Screening Tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392874,"Public benefits programs help people afford necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. In the US, such programs are means-tested: applicants must complete long forms to prove financial distress before receiving aid. Online benefits screening tools provide a gloss of such forms, advising households about their eligibility prior to completing full applications. If incorrectly implemented, screening tools may discourage qualified households from applying for benefits. Unfortunately, errors in screening tools are difficult to detect because they surface one at a time and difficult to contest because unofficial determinations do not generate a paper trail. We introduce a method for auditing such tools in four steps: 1) generate test households, 2) automatically populate screening questions with household information and retrieve determinations, 3) translate eligibility guidelines into computer code to generate ground truth determinations, and 4) identify conflicting determinations to detect errors. We illustrated our method on a real screening tool with households modeled from census data. Our method exposed major errors with corresponding examples to reproduce them. Our work provides a necessary corrective to an already arduous benefits application process. As long as the US welfare system remains so complex, the tools meant to help people navigate it should be well calibrated. We do not know what potential applicants expect from an interaction with a screening tool, nor how they make sense of eligibility predictions. While our auditing method could help produce more accurate screening tools, it alone will not address the structural reasons that these errors exist and have been tolerated. Screening tools are not the single broken piece in an otherwise perfect welfare system. Errors in full benefits applications have caused real, demonstrable deprivation [13, 25]. Future work could explore auditing methods for automated application evaluation technology. This would require much greater institutional cooperation than we secured. Our method cannot be directly fitted to this technology, since filing false applications is fraud. Further, full applications are far more complex than screening tools and their records persist across interaction sessions. Researchers in other disciplines have engaged with these issues and are exploring alternate ways to structure the relations between the state and the poor. They might not know what technology is available to advance those visions. In the future, we should not just be looking to verify poverty management tools and perfect existing institutional practices. Instead, we must interrogate the structural problems that lead to these broken systems. If we believe that technology can play a positive role in poverty management, we can imagine better systems for providing care."
Learning from Tweets: Opportunities and Challenges to Inform Policy Making During Dengue Epidemic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392875,"Social media platforms are widely used by people to report, access, and share information during outbreaks and epidemics. Although government agencies and healthcare institutions in developed regions are increasingly relying on social media to develop epidemic forecasts and outbreak response, there is a limited understanding of how people in developing regions interact on social media during outbreaks and what useful insights this dataset could offer during public health crises. In this work, we examined 28,688 tweets to identify public health issues during dengue epidemic in Bangladesh and found several insights, such as irregularities in dengue diagnosis and treatment, shortage of blood supply for Rh negative blood groups, and high local transmission of dengue during Eid-ul-Adha, that impact disease preparedness and outbreak response. We discuss the opportunities and challenges in analyzing tweets and outline how government agencies and healthcare institutions can use social media health data to inform policy making during public health crises. We present an in-depth analysis of the tweets related to dengue epidemic in Bangladesh to explore the role of social media health data in informing policy making approaches. We apply a humancentered lens to discover insights from the reactions and responses of Twitter users to dengue epidemic in Bangladesh. Our analysis identified various epidemiological, geographical, cultural, and societal factors that mediated the outcomes of dengue epidemic in Bangladesh, which were not perceptible at the first glance. We also showed how our findings could inform policy making approaches to control dengue outbreaks. We believe this work will greatly facilitate social media supported cooperative works to cope with public health crises in developing countries."
MAMAS: Supporting Parent--Child Mealtime Interactions Using Automated Tracking and Speech Recognition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392876,"Many parents of young children find it challenging to deal with their children's eating problems, and parent--child mealtime interaction is fundamental in forming children's healthy eating habits. In this paper, we present the results of a three-week study through which we deployed a mealtime assistant application, MAMAS, for monitoring parent--child mealtime conversation and food intake with 15 parent--child pairs. Our findings indicate that the use of MAMAS helped 1) increase children's autonomy during mealtime, 2) enhance parents' self-awareness of their words and behaviors, 3) promote the parent--child relationship, and 4) positively influence the mealtime experiences of the entire family. The study also revealed some challenges in eating behavior interventions due to the complex dynamics of childhood eating problems. Based on the findings, we discuss how a mealtime assistant application can be better designed for parents and children with challenging eating behaviors. In this study, we investigated the impact of a mealtime assistant system for improving childrenâs challenging eating behaviors by monitoring childrenâs food intake and parentâchild interaction through a three-week deployment study. Our findings showed that the use of MAMAS helped increase childrenâs autonomy during mealtime, enhance parentsâ self-awareness of their words and behaviors, promote parentâchild relationships, and positively influence the mealtime experiences of the entire family. Furthermore, the findings of the study revealed some challenges in eating behavior interventions due to the complex dynamics of childhood eating problems. Based on the findings, we discussed the potential benefits of the semi-automated tracking approach, the importance of encouraging self-reflection on the subjective aspect of mealtime experiences, ways to provide technological support for quality family conversations during mealtime, and the need for facilitating the flexible use of tracking systems. We hope more research in this area will investigate ways to better assist parents in dealing with their childrenâs challenging eating behaviors, considering the complex dynamics of family mealtimes."
Parallel Worlds: Repeated Initializations of the Same Team to Improve Team Viability,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392877,"A team's early interactions are influential: small behaviors cascade, driving the team either toward successful collaboration or toward fracture. Would a team be more viable if it could undo initial interactional missteps and try again? We introduce a technique that supports online and remote teams in creating multiple parallel worlds: the same team meets many times, led to believe that each convening is with a new team due to pseudonym masking while actual membership remains static. Afterward, the team moves forward with the parallel world with the highest viability by using the same pseudonyms and conversation history from that instance. In two experiments, we find that this technique improves team viability: teams that are reconvened from the highest-viability parallel world are significantly more viable than the same group meeting in a new parallel world. Our work suggests parallel worlds can help teams start off on the right foot - and stay there. In this article, we introduce a parallel world intervention to support high viability collaborations for online and remote teams. We examined how and to what extent the manipulation of transactive memory through selective reestablishment of specific team interactions impacts a teamâs present viability during a team-based creative task. We find that upon reconvening the highest-viability parallel world, the second interaction achieves a viability consistent with its first interaction and higher than that of a fresh start. Furthermore, when the lowest-viability parallel world is reconvened, team viability is remediated but does not improve past the level of a fresh start. Thus, by leveraging the large variation in dynamics for a single team and masking to erase unfavorable past interactions, we help teams find their best configuration and stay there even if the team had originally started off on the wrong foot. This research offers opportunities for online teams to go beyond being there [31] â to gain opportunities that traditional, in-person teams lack. By helping teams sidestep accidental false starts early rather than pursuing a sometimes quixotic quest to undo them, we hope that this approach can help promote more pro-social teamwork and enjoyable collaborations."
"Human Factors in Model Interpretability: Industry Practices, Challenges, and Needs",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392878,"As the use of machine learning (ML) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. While scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like HCI, ML, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. This lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. To bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. Based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ML models. The characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. We present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs. In this work, we empirically investigated industry practitionersâ model interpretability practices, challenges, and needs. We describe roles, processes, goals, and strategies around interpretability practiced by ML practitioners working in a variety of domains. We draw out important contrasts between our results and the predominant framing of interpretability in existing research as a property of a model that can be defined solely in light of an individual versus a ML modelâs alignment. Our results lead us to characterize interpretability as inherently social and negotiated, aimed at fostering trust both in people and in models, context-dependent, and arising from careful comparisons of human mental models. Our identification of unaddressed technological needs among practitioners is intended to help researchers direct their attention to unaddressed, yet prevalent, challenges in industry."
Decolonizing Tactics as Collective Resilience: Identity Work of AAPI Communities on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392881,"Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities use online platforms like Reddit to build capacity for resilience from white hegemony. We conduct interviews with 21 moderators of AAPI subreddits to understand how sociotechnical systems contour and contribute to the marginalization of online communities. We examine marginalization through the analytic framework of decolonization and uncover the threats and tactics that AAPI redditors encounter and employ to decolonize their collective identity. We find that moderators of AAPI subreddits develop collective resilience within their online communities by reclaiming space to confront brigade invasion, recording collective memory to circumvent systemic erasure, and revising cultural narratives to deconstruct colonial mentality. We describe how algorithmic configurations within sociotechnical systems reaffirm existing hegemonic values and discuss how users and designers of sociotechnical systems may work toward resisting white hegemony. While the marginalization of groups has been occurring for millennia, online communities provide a space for people to safely negotiate tensions of their intersectional identities on topics such as race or citizenship. In this paper, we focus on uncovering how AAPI subreddits enable the process of decolonization to occur and build capacity for collective resilience. We find that these online communities constantly fight for their existence through decolonizing tactics that include reclaiming space to confront brigade invasion, recording collective memory to circumvent systemic erasure, and revising cultural narratives to deconstruct colonial mentality. We center the perspectives of AAPI moderators and discuss how their acts of resistance challenge and circumvent their systemic marginalization as materialized by white hegemonic forces."
DreamCatcher: Exploring How Parents and School-Age Children can Track and Review Sleep Information Together,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392882,"Parents and their school-age children can impact one another's sleep. Most sleep-tracking tools, however, are designed for adults and make it difficult for parents and children to track together. To examine how to design a family-centered sleep tracking tool, we designed DreamCatcher. DreamCatcher is an in-home, interactive, shared display that aggregates data from wrist-worn sleep sensors and self-reported mood. We deployed DreamCatcher as a probe to examine the design space of tracking sleep as a family. Ten families participated in the study probe between 15 and 50 days. This study uses a family systems perspective to explore research questions regarding the feasibility of children actively tracking health data alongside their parents and the effects of tracking and sharing on family dynamics. Our results indicate that children can be active tracking contributors and that having parents and children track together encourages turn-taking and working together. However, there were also moments when family members, in particular parents, felt discomfort from sharing their sleep and mood with other family members. Our research contributes to a growing understanding of designing family centered health-informatics tools to support the combined needs of parents and children. This paper demonstrates opportunities for including children in family-centered tracking technologies. It contributes: (1) an empirical understanding of how to design family-centered tracking tools that support parents and children, and (2) a novel technological artifact for family-based sleep and mood tracking in the home. We explored designing a tool that supports parents and children in tracking and reflecting on sleep and mood. From the health perspective, we focused on family sleep due to its overall importance in family health, the relationship between childrenâs and parent sleep, and because it is an interesting case study for exploring privacy issues. From a technological perspective, we focused on family sleep because most sleep tracking platforms focus on a single adult user. Our exploration centers on the iterative design process, development, and deployment of a family-centered, sleep-tracking system, called DreamCatcher. Our results show that children can participate in tracking along with their parents. Children reported mood on behalf of themselves and others, interacted with the sleep views more than parents, and left audio messages as much as their parents. Providing the means for parents and children to track together affects family tracking dynamics. Tracking technology generally supports a parent tracking a child âwhich fits into the boundary that exists of parents taking care of children. DreamCatcher distributed tracking across all family members, which changed the traditional role of a parent being the sole tracker to children self-reporting, reporting on behalf of their parents, and viewing information for all family members through one representation. Our work shows that even if one family members discontinued to track, the design of DreamCatcher allowed for the rest of the family to continue tracking. Future work should apply the insights and address the challenges presented in this study. Continuing research in the design of family tracking technologies has the potential to support family-focused technological behavioral intervention to improve sleep quality."

Can you Turn it Off?: The Spatial and Social Context of Mobile Disturbance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415162,"Contemporary mobile devices continuously interrupt people with notifications in various and changing physical environments. As different places can have different social setting, understanding how disturbing an interruption might be to people around the user is not a straightforward task. To understand how users perceive disturbance in their social environment, we analyze the results of a 3-week user study with 50 participants using the experience sampling method and log analysis. We show that perceptions of disturbance are strongly related to the social norms surrounding the place, such as whether the place is considered private or public, even when controlling for the number of people around the user. Furthermore, users' perceptions of disturbance are also related to the activity carried out on the phone, and the subjective perceptions of isolation from other people in the space. We conclude the paper by discussing how our findings can be used to design new mobile devices that are aware of the social norms and their users' environmental context. Our paper explores the factors that are related to the way social disturbance is perceived by users. Social disturbance is related to the social context of the place, including the number of people around the user, how public the place is perceived, as well as the activity carried out in the place. The norms and the perceptions of a place are at least as important (if not more important) than the its functional properties (such as the number of people in the place). Factors that are related to the userâs own activities also play a role: perceptions of privacy and the activity carried on the phone. Overall, these results point to ways in which mobile interruption management systems, including both applications and operating systems, might be designed differently to help support devices that try to respect the social norms around the users and to reduce social tensions. This might involve sensors that are more aware of what other people are doing in this space, as well as opportunities to externalize and communicate these norms. Our methodology can serve as a case study for investigating the use of various mobile technologies, quickly collecting information grounded within a physical context, and guiding the development of technologies that are more sensitive to the physical contexts or urban environments that are geared towards mobile technologies."
Hate begets Hate: A Temporal Study of Hate Speech,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415163,"With the ongoing debate on 'freedom of speech' vs. 'hate speech,' there is an urgent need to carefully understand the consequences of the inevitable culmination of the two, i.e., 'freedom of hate speech' over time. An ideal scenario to understand this would be to observe the effects of hate speech in an (almost) unrestricted environment. Hence, we perform the first temporal analysis of hate speech on Gab.com, a social media site with very loose moderation policy. We first generate temporal snapshots of Gab from millions of posts and users. Using these temporal snapshots, we compute an activity vector based on DeGroot model to identify hateful users. The amount of hate speech in Gab is steadily increasing and the new users are becoming hateful at an increased and faster rate. Further, our analysis analysis reveals that the hate users are occupying the prominent positions in the Gab network. Also, the language used by the community as a whole seem to correlate more with that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful ones. We discuss how, many crucial design questions in CSCW open up from our work. In this paper, we perform the ""rst temporal analysis of hate speech in online social media. Using an extensive dataset of 21M posts by 314K users on Gab, we divide the dataset into multiple snapshots and assign a hate score to each user at every snapshot. We then check for variations in the hate score of the user. We characterize these account types on the basis of text and network structure. We observe that a large fraction of hateful users occupy the core of the Gab network and they reach the core at a much faster rate as compared to non-hateful users. The language of the community as a whole is getting more correlated to that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful users. Our work would be useful to platform designers to detect the hateful users at an early stage and introduce appropriate measures to moderate the usersâ stance."
"Investigating Differences in Crowdsourced News Credibility Assessment: Raters, Tasks, and Expert Criteria",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415164,"Misinformation about critical issues such as climate change and vaccine safety is oftentimes amplified on online social and search platforms. The crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the assessments of experts at scale. In this work, we investigate news credibility assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between them differ. We gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken from 2 crowd groups---journalism students and Upwork workers---as well as 2 expert groups---journalists and scientists---on a varied set of 50 news articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between public opinion and expert consensus. Examining the ratings, we find differences in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication. Finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. From these findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd processes that are tailored to specific crowds and types of content. In this work, using the domain of climate news, we dive into the notion of crowdsourcing credibility through a series of analyses on its main components: the makeup of the crowd, the scope of tasks that the crowd is assigned, and the subject area expert criteria in question. In particular, we explore characteristics of the âcrowd,â in terms of traits such as background, demographics, and political leaning, and whether they have bearings on task performance. We show this in a comparison between ratings made by students and others recruited through journalism networks versus crowd workers on UpWork. We also interrogate the nature of the crowdsourcing task itself, finding that the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication has different relationship to both crowds and experts. This led us to better understand the reasoning of experts themselves. In our case, we looked at how experts in journalism versus experts in science have different ways to assess article credibility based on the factors such as Credible Evidence/Grounding and Publication Reputation. Disagreement among raters is neither always bad nor always about their capacities, but at times about suitability of the task [2] and about the particular subject area expertise in question as well. By investigating the variability introduced by all these components, we point towards how the design of crowd assessments to approximate expert-level credibility can be made more robust."
From Virtual Strangers to IRL Friends: Relationship Development in Livestreaming Communities on Twitch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415165,"Accounts of the social experience within livestreaming channels vary widely, from the frenetic ""crowdroar"" offered in some channels to the close-knit, ""participatory communities"" within others. What kinds of livestreaming communities enable the types of meaningful conversation and connection that support relationship development, and how? In this paper, we explore how personal relationships develop within Twitch, a popular livestreaming service. Interviews with 21 pairs who met initially within Twitch channels illustrate how interactions originating in Twitch's text-based, pseudonymous chat environment can evolve into close relationships, marked by substantial trust and support. Consistent with Walther's hyperpersonal model, these environments facilitate self-disclosure and conversation by reducing physical cues and emphasizing common ground, while frequent, low-stakes interaction allow relationships to deepen over time. Our findings also highlight boundaries of the hyperpersonal model. As group size increases, participants leverage affordances for elevated visibility to spark interactions; as relationships deepen, they incorporate complementary media channels to increase intimacy. Often, relationships become so deep through purely computer-mediated channels that face-to-face meetings become yet another step in a continuum of relationship development. Findings from a survey of 1,367 members of Twitch communities demonstrate how the suitability of these spaces as venues for relational interaction decreases as communities increase in size. Together, these findings illustrate vividly how hyperpersonal interaction functions in the context of real online communities. We consider implications for the design and management of online communities, including their potential for supporting ""strong bridges,"" relationships which combine the benefits of strong ties and network bridges. Public perception of livestreaming services is often driven by massive streams and events, leading many non-users to believe that meaningful connection is impossible, but the experiences of individuals engaging with these services has often shown otherwise. We began this study to understand how common these experiences were, and to understand how deep, human connections could develop within this pseudonymous, often chaotic, and sometimes mischievous environment. We were surprised and deeply impressed by the depth of the relationships that our participants described and the levels of social, emotional, and instrumental support which grew from connections created by that environment. The findings of this work provide insight into how sociotechnical design decisions influence relationship formation processes in computer-mediated communication spaces and point to the potential of CMC environments for fostering âstrong bridgesâ or relationships that offer a high degree of support alongside access to resources from outside oneâs network."
Exploring Design Principles for Sharing of Personal Informatics Data on Ephemeral Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415166,"People often do not receive the engagement or responses they desire when they share on broad social media platforms. Sharers are hesitant to share trivial accomplishments, and the emphasis on data often results posts that audiences find repetitive or unengaging. Ephemeral social media's focus on self-authored content and sharing trivial accomplishments has the potential to ameliorate these challenges. We explore design principles for incorporating personal informatics data like steps, heart rate, or duration in data-driven stickers as a first step towards integrating these data into ephemeral social media. We examine the effect of a sticker's presentation style, domain, domain-relevance, and background through three surveys with 506 total participants. We uncover the importance of domain-relevant backgrounds and stickers, identify the situational value of stickers styled as analogies, embellished, and badges, and demonstrate that data-driven stickers can make ephemeral content more informative and entertaining, discussing implications for platforms and tools. We contribute design recommendations for sharing personal informatics data via overlays on ephemeral social media, demonstrating that these overlays are entertaining and informative. The badge, embellished, and analogy stickers we designed can each offer value when explaining moments or celebrating them, though preference depends on circumstance and aesthetics. When possible, the design of overlays should reflect the domain being shared and allow the sharer to use their own photo as a background. Integrating these stickers into ephemeral platforms and evaluating them could lead to useful insights about when people find it most useful to include personal informatics data in posts to ephemeral social media."
Human-AI Collaboration in a Cooperative Game Setting: Measuring Social Perception and Outcomes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415167,"Human-AI interaction is pervasive across many areas of our day to day lives. In this paper, we investigate human-AI collaboration in the context of a collaborative AI-driven word association game with partially observable information. In our experiments, we test various dimensions of subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, creativity and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an AI or with a human. We also test subjective social perceptions of participants towards their partners when participants are presented with a variety of confidence levels. We ran a large scale study on Mechanical Turk (n=164) of this collaborative game. Our results show that when participants believe their partners were human, they found their partners to be more likeable, intelligent, creative and having more rapport and use more positive words to describe their partner's attributes than when they believed they were interacting with an AI partner. We also found no differences in game outcome including win rate and turns to completion. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss AI agent transparency, include design implications for tools incorporating or supporting human-AI collaboration, and lay out directions for future research. Our findings lead to implications for other forms of human-AI interaction and communication. In this work, we investigate user perception towards a partner in an AI-driven game when users are told they are competing against a bot and when users are told they are competing against a human. We found that people find their partners to be more intelligent, more likeable, more creative and overall have more rapport with partners if people believed to be interacting with a human. We also investigated the effect of confidence on social perception and find that users had more rapport with partners who did not show confidence or displayed low confidence. Interactions were constant for all participants despite user perception of whether the partner was an AI or a human, but participants also had more positive sentiment towards their âhumanâ partners. However, unlike in human-human collaboration studies, in our human-AI context, these social perceptions did not impact the collaboration outcomes (i.e. game win/loss). This research leads to new insights about how to study human-AI collaboration and lays the groundwork for future studies."
Using the Crowd to Prevent Harmful AI Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415168,"To prevent harmful AI behavior, people need to specify constraints that forbid undesirable actions. Unfortunately, this is a complex task, since writing rules that distinguish harmful from non-harmful actions tends to be quite difficult in real-world situations. Therefore, such decisions have historically been made by a small group of powerful AI companies and developers, with limited community input. In this paper, we study how to enable a crowd of non-AI experts to work together to communicate high-quality, reliable constraints to AI systems. We first focus on understanding how humans reason about temporal dynamics in the context of AI behavior, finding through experiments on a novel game-based testbed that participants tend to adopt a long-term notion of harm, even in uncertain situations that do not affect them directly. Building off of this insight, we explore task design for long-term constraint specification, developing new filtering approaches and new methods of promoting user reflection. Next, we develop a novel rule-based interface which allows people to craft rules in an accessible fashion without programming knowledge. We test our approaches on a real-world AI problem in the domain of education, and find that our new filtering mechanisms and interfaces significantly improve constraint quality and human efficiency. We also demonstrate how these systems can be applied to other real-world AI problems (e.g. in social networks). In this paper, we studied how one can use a crowd of humans to help prevent harmful AI behavior. We found that crowd workers seem inclined to adopt a long-term notion of harm even in uncertain settings, a fact which allows the task of AI constraint specification to be more easily divided up across individuals. In more complicated real-world scenarios, we found that making decisions about the harmfulness of AI actions can be quite challenging, but our new fake gold and one-sided explanation designs were able to substantially increase constraint quality. Further, our novel rulebased interface is quite effective, remaining accessible while greatly increasing human efficiency. In this paper, we have examined cases where decisions about AI harm require cognitive effort to determine but are ultimately fairly clear-cut, whereas the Moral Machine work studied the opposite extreme: easy to understand but highly controversial decisions. Future work includes exploring how to combine these two paradigms to reliably determine harmful behavior in situations that are both complex and highly controversial. Indeed, there are many future directions here, as we do not yet know how to effectively use the crowd when the harm of a complex task is not so black-and-white but instead is highly abstract, contested, or personal. For instance, consider the decision of when to open the economy during a novel viral pandemic. Although most would agree that we want to make the decision that causes the least harm, how to define âharmâ is extremely complex, uncertain, and controversial. For instance, how can we determine how to trade-off economic harm with the chance of risking human lives? To answer these questions, data-driven AI approaches alone are not sufficient, and we must incorporate the values and opinions of an extremely diverse set of stakeholders, including medical professionals, business owners, and laypeople. To bring individuals with this vast range of expertise into the conversation, we first need technology which makes decision-making surrounding AI safety accessible to a broader population. It is also vital that the AI safety questions posed are in some sense sound; importantly, they should minimize the influence of AI âexpertsâ and shift power to impacted groups. This paper takes the first step in that direction, moving towards a future where diverse groups of people without AI expertise can work effectively together to directly address real-world AI decision-making and thus prevent AI harm."
Life Review Using a Life Metaphoric Game to Promote Intergenerational Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415169,"This study explores whether a life metaphoric game can effectively facilitate communication between senior participants and young adult partners during a life review activity. Life review provides older adults with opportunities to organize their past experiences, rediscover the meaning of life, and prepare for their future life and eventual death. We held workshops in which 33 senior participants (ages 51-85) co-played a commercial game, titled ""Long Journey of Life,"" paired with young adult partners (ages 19-23). The young partners asked senior participants about their associated memories during the life review activity. Through inductive thematic analysis, we found seven communication themes during the life review activity: reminiscence, future and death preparation, life advice, appreciation and evaluation, small talks involving self-disclosure, interpretation of metaphors, and explanation of game control methods. We investigated the relationships between communication themes and game design elements that promote conversation. In addition, we identified how participants' responses to the game differ depending on the player's characteristics and generation. Game design suggestions for an effective intergenerational life review using digital games were offered. This study revealed that life metaphoric games could be useful tools to promote various communication themes during intergenerational life review activities. However, some limitations of this study should be considered. First, although a dyadic approach was adopted, but there was the imbalance in numbers between senior participants and young partners. Moreover, the responses of young partners were not collected and analyzed sufficiently in comparison to the senior participants. Second, we could not include participants in familial relationships, even though such activities are well-suited for people in familial relationships. Third, because the game was not targeted at older adults or intentionally designed for life review, accessibility with respect to the size of text and objects was unsatisfactory for some participants. Finally, the traditional structured life review is performed via an in-depth interview about each life stage through eight meetings [31]. However, this workshop was conducted as a one-day session, and the gameplay times were short. As the workshop was conducted over a short period, changes in the relationship between the reviewer and listener could not be carefully observed. Despite the limitations, the study attempted a new activity by combining intergenerational play and life review. Future research is needed to investigate whether these activities can contribute to promoting successful aging and intergenerational relationships. In addition, it is necessary to expand the scope of the study to include familial relationships. Although games are primarily designed for young adults, many middle- and older-aged players have continuously played them since their childhood. The demand for games among such players has resulted in a mature gaming industry. Successful life review games deliver players with rich impressions through reminiscence associated with the gameâs stories. In addition, they can help older adults take on a storytelling role, allowing them to continually contribute to the community and maintain their social status. These findings can support future researchers and designers of games for life review."
Understanding the Homepreneurship Opportunities Afforded by Social Networking and Personal Fabrication Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415170,"The decreased cost and increased usability of personal fabrication technologies has enabled a new generation of crafters to integrate digital designs and computationally created artifacts into physically-based practices. With the simultaneous ubiquity of e-commerce and social networking channels, these technologies have enabled many crafters to transform their hobbies into home-based businesses. To understand the opportunities and challenges that fusing social networking platforms, personal fabrication equipment, and e-commerce have afforded these homepreneurs, an online survey and follow-up interviews were conducted with crafters who use hobbyist cutting plotters to personalize and sell goods online. The findings uncovered an emerging group of homepreneurs, i.e., mompreneurs, who use these technologies for supplemental income for their families and highlighted the emotional and opportunistic benefits that such personalized, at-home manufacturing affords. They also highlighted the workflows and lifestyle implications of using these technologies to run home-based businesses, the multi-faceted usage and dependence these homepreneurs have on online social platforms such as Facebook, the complex software toolchains that are used, and the commonplace practice of appropriating designs from others that occurs in this community. The continued ubiquity and decreased cost of personal fabrication equipment has enabled many to enhance traditional handiwork practices and processes with technology. Simultaneously, the reach and growing pervasiveness of social networking platforms has enabled those with entrepreneurial goals to have access to, and cultivate, growing client bases. Nowhere have the opportunities afforded by the fusion of personal fabrication and social networking been more visibly prevalent than within the crafting community. As this work has demonstrated, a growing population of crafters have begun using low-cost desktop cutting plotters to start businesses that create bespoke, personalized goods for others. Through interview and survey data with Canadians who are part of this community, this work uncovered a growing subset of homepreneurs, i.e., mompreneurs, that balance childcare or fulltime jobs with their business activities using conjoined spaces in their homes. The data underscored the complex software tool chains that these deskilled users have developed to create personalized deigns and graphics for their business and the challenges that arise when these safe, portable, and easy to use personal fabrication machines are used at home for entrepreneurial purposes. Interestingly, Facebook was also found to act as a scaffold to the digital economy for these homepreneurs through its frictionless ability to support the finding of local clients, gathering of ideas for goods, co-working on orders with clients, searching for help, researching oneâs competition, and the acquisition of materials. The downside of using such platforms, however, was that homepreneurs often fused their personal and business lives online, resulting in challenges with identity management. Fueled by the saturated completion within homepreneursâ local areas and the functionality found in cutting plotter software, the appropriation of otherâs intellectual property was also found to be a rampant and significant practice and challenge within this community. By identifying the obstacles these homepreneurs face when using fabrication machines such as cutting plotters, the implications of using social media to spur local sales, and the lifestyle influences of their workflows, this research has demonstrated the opportunities that the fusion of personal fabrication, social media, and e-commerce have provided to a growing community of crafters. As the frontier of personal fabrication technologies and equipment continues to expand, equipment becomes more inexpensive and attainable, and the community and their activities become more diverse, there will be an increased need to further understand and develop solutions to the opportunities and challenges that these homepreneurs and other content creators will face."
Wikipedia Edit-a-thons as Sites of Public Pedagogy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415171,"Wikipedia edit-a-thon events provide a targeted approach toward incorporating new knowledge into the online encyclopedia while also offering pathways toward new editor participation. Through the analysis of interviews with 13 edit-a-thon facilitators, however, we find motivations for running edit-a-thons extend far beyond adding content and editors. In this paper, we uncover how a range of personal and institutional values inspire these event facilitators toward fulfilling broader goals including fostering information literacy and establishing community relationships outside of Wikipedia. Along with reporting motivations, values, and goals, we also describe strategies facilitators adopt in their practice. Next, we discuss challenges faced by facilitators as they organize edit-a-thons. We situate our findings within two complementary theoretical lenses-information ecologies and public pedagogy to guide our interpretation. Finally, we suggest new ways in which edit-a-thons, as well as similar peer production events and communities, can be understood, studied, and evaluated. In September 2019, as we were conducting this study, the Wikimedia Foundation released a highlevel report titled âWikimedia Movement Organizers: Understanding the People who Power the Movementâ [58]. âOrganizersâ in this report include not only people who organize and facilitate edit-a-thons, but also those who disseminate Wikipedia content in settings with limited Internet connectivity, coordinate large-scale contribution of media artifacts (e.g., historical photos) and others from cultural and educational institutions. Many of the findings of the report, especially on organizersâ motivations and the results of their efforts, echo what we find in our study. We also see a de-centering of editingââediting is not a requirement,â (p. 26)âand a recognition that the work of these organizers enable the integration of Wikimedia âinto a wider knowledge ecosystemâ (p. 3). Our work complements this report by offering an in-depth and independent analysis of edit-athon facilitation. We focus on edit-a-thon facilitatorsâ contributions to the creation and evolution of local knowledge and information ecosystemsâand how these ecosystems connect to and interact with the broader Wikipedia community and ecosystems. This process has broad implications as it represents how knowledgeâparticularly of subjects at the margins and underrepresented in Wikipediaâis produced, negotiated, and recorded within an online community. The resulting knowledge, as discussed earlier in our introduction and discussion sections (Â§ 1,Â§ 5.3), is not only visible within Wikipedia, but also present in Google search results, Facebook feeds, and other seemingly independent contexts that constitute our broader digital cultures. Emergent artificial intelligence technologies also use Wikipedia content as training data, which can further propagate Wikipediaâs gaps and biases [32]. Along with an analysis of how local information ecologies emerge, a central contribution of our work is an accounting and theoretical grounding of resistance to these biases. The implication of what we find applies to both future CSCW research as well as programs seeking to support peer production of free and open content online. What future CSCW researchers studying digital cultures, as well as programs seeking to support and evaluate edit-a-thons and similar offline events, need to be aware of is these events are not simply about new contributions and contributors, but also represent sites of negotiation and contestation. Decisions regarding who participates, who is visible, what is counted as knowledge, what is recorded, and what is shown to others not only affect users of online peer production platforms, but almost everyone using the Internet today"
Informational Friction as a Lens for Studying Algorithmic Aspects of Privacy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415172,"This paper addresses challenges in conceptualizing privacy posed by algorithmic systems that can infer sensitive information from seemingly innocuous data. This type of privacy is of imminent concern due to the rapid adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems in virtually every industry. In this paper, we suggest informational friction, a concept from Floridi's ethics of information, as a valuable conceptual lens for studying algorithmic aspects of privacy. Informational friction describes the amount of work required for one agent to access or alter the information of another. By focusing on amount of work, rather than the type of information or manner in which it is collected, informational friction can help to explain why automated analyses should raise privacy concerns independently of, and in addition to, those associated with data collection. As a demonstration, this paper analyze law enforcement use of facial recognition, andFacebook's targeted advertising model using informational friction and demonstrate risks inherent to these systems which are not completely identified in another popular framework, Nissenbaum's Contextual Integrity.The paper concludes with a discussion of broader implications, both for privacy research and for privacy regulation. This paper explores how Floridiâs concept of informational friction can provide valuable perspectives on modern privacy issues, especially those concerning automated data analysis [30]. By investigating the amount of effort required to access an agentâs information, we can move beyond a binary distinction, between âviolatedâ and ânot violated,â and towards a more qualitative assessment of how the features and context of a system increase or decrease informational friction. To reiterate, increasing information friction does not necessarily provide a lever for designers or policy makers to increase privacy. Rather, when studying, crafting policy around, and designing technology, IF suggests that we should pay attention not only to whether current practices are acceptable or not, but also how they alter informational friction to make more or less privacy actually attainable. Put differently, we should not necessarily seek in every instance to ameliorate algorithmic reductions in privacy by increasing informational friction. Rather, for any given mitigation strategy, we can ask what impact that strategy may have on informational friction. While this is not the only important question to ask in assessing possible mitigation strategies, it is a valuable one that, as argued in this paper, can reveal aspects not well highlighted via other conceptual framings. Moreover, focusing on the specific features that elevate this risk may open up more options to protect internet users, both in terms of regulatory policies and in terms of technology design."
Mediating Community-AI Interaction through Situated Explanation: The Case of AI-Led Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415173,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become prevalent in our everyday technologies and impacts both individuals and communities. The explainable AI (XAI) scholarship has explored the philosophical nature of explanation and technical explanations, which are usually driven by experts in lab settings and can be challenging for laypersons to understand. In addition, existing XAI research tends to focus on the individual level. Little is known about how people understand and explain AI-led decisions in the community context. Drawing from XAI and activity theory, a foundational HCI theory, we theorize how explanation is situated in a community's shared values, norms, knowledge, and practices, and how situated explanation mediates community-AI interaction. We then present a case study of AI-led moderation, where community members collectively develop explanations of AI-led decisions, most of which are automated punishments. Lastly, we discuss the implications of this framework at the intersection of CSCW, HCI, and XAI. In this paper, we drew from activity theory, a foundational HCI theory, to analyze the mediational role of explanation in community-AI interaction. We presented an empirical case to further illustrate the AT analysis of explainable AI. We argue that explanation is not just about providing accurate information about the internal workings of AI, but also related to the community context where norms, practices, values, and knowledge are cultivated along the use of AI. Explanation is human activity that is socially, culturally, and historically situated. An AT lens that pays attention to contradictions and balanced states is invaluable in understanding and designing sustainable social systems of community-AI interaction."
"Spontaneous, Yet Studious: Esports Commentators' Live Performance and Self-Presentation Practices",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415174,"Esports commentating, the practice of reporting, explaining, and elaborating live competitive gameplay to spectators, is a centerpiece of esports as a rapidly growing spectator sport and an essential component of today's growing gaming/live streaming ecosystem. In particular, esports commentators face three unique challenges: the preparation for conducting real time commentating on highly dynamic esports games; the complexity of in-the-moment decisions during the game's broadcast; and the balance between personal self-presentation and professional content presentation. Yet this emerging and novel sociotechnical practice and how these challenges affect esports commentators' live performance and self-presentation practices has received relatively little research attention in HCI and CSCW. In this paper, we endeavor to address these limitations by empirically analyzing 19 esports commentators' sociotechnical practices. Our findings highlight the complex interaction dynamics involved in esports commentating as well as the importance of professionalism and social presence in esports commentators' self-presentation. In order to execute seamless and spontaneous commentary, commentators must be studious and engage in much prior research and have a clear sense of self. We contribute to the growing CSCW literature on esports commentating practices by revealing esports commentators' unique decision making process presenting information and their self-image. As esports commentating is increasingly transforming how people experience traditional sports commentating, gaming, and live streaming simultaneously, how would esports commentators prepare and manage such novel and complicated practices? And what are their strategies to present themselves in this complex ecosystem consisting of players, co-commentators, viewers, and technology? In this study, we endeavor to explore these questions by understanding 1) how esports commentators prepare for their live streaming in terms of aesthetics, physical function, and game knowledge; 2) methods they employ to choose what information to focus on during casting; and 3) their unique considerations when presenting themselves online. Especially, we highlight the complex interaction dynamics involved in esports commentating, which points to the need for future research to reconsider the role of interactivity in live streaming. Our insights on the importance of professionalism and social presence in esports commentatorsâ self-presentation may also lead to potential new perspectives to study self-presentation online â by taking the specific subculture where one belongs to and the co-presenters (not just audience) into account. Therefore, we contribute to the growing CSCW literature on esports commentating and live streaming by revealing esports commentatorsâ unique decision making process for streaming and self-presentation. Our focus on esports commentating, an understudied sociotechnical practice, also offers new empirical evidence of nuanced self-presentation practices afforded by emerging technology."
"Party Politics, Values and the Design of Social Media Services: Implications of political elites' values and ideologies to mitigating of political polarisation through design",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415175,"There have been several attempts to support political engagement through novel social media services. While the political nature of any technologies is widely acknowledged in human-computer interaction, such considerations have been less studied when designing for political engagement in social media services. We used speculative design probes to gauge how political elites perceive alternative social media interfaces designed to increase media diversity and decrease political polarisation. We show how elites? reactions to design probes could be rooted into party ideologies. Based on these, we discuss directions how social media services could be designed. Our underlying contribution is wider. We show how studying elites can provide insights about politics embedded into proposed novel social media services for political engagement. Second, we demonstrate what elites? perspective provide fruitful way to expand and rethink concepts that have been used to study ordinary people before. Finally, we discuss potential challenges of replacing economic interests with political interest in social media service design and provide a richer account on the discussion about social media regulation. Therefore, we pave the way to more research to critically study elites within social computing scholarship and highlight the importance of understanding political motivations which can guide the development of social media. Our work acknowledged that generally humanâcomputer interaction scholars acknowledge that values are embedded to any technologies they developed [80, 111] and have developed several approaches to account for this in their work [e.g., value-sensitive, participatory and speculative design approaches; 11, 14, 34, 49, 70, 112]. However, when humanâcomputer interaction scholars design systems for political participation and engagement, these critical considerations are less prominently present. In this work, we identified how politics may present itself in these domains and discussed the democratic implications of these, Our analysis shows that political values and ideologies can be seen in reactions to both to exact delivery mechanisms as well as deeper underlying values technologies may manifest. For example, some members of political elites preferred more paternalistic values while others highlighted the importance of freedom. Second, we suggested that studying political elites instead of (ordinary) users provides insights which may help to move theoretic discussion forward. Based on our results, we discuss how challenging landscape designing for politics is given the diverging values in society and discuss challenges and benefits of particular design directions. Our results provide a starting point to balance the discussion on design of social media platforms. Today, many discussants highlight that platformsâ economic interests drive their choices and ask for alternative approaches. However, involving governments regulation directly could make the design open for political interests. These discussions invite additional scholarship on potential design approaches which consider the party politics as well as more empirical research on political ideologies in the design and acceptability of digital systems."
"""I Hope This Is Helpful"": Understanding Crowdworkers' Challenges and Motivations for an Image Description Task",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415176,"AI image captioning challenges encourage broad participation in designing algorithms that automatically create captions for a variety of images and users. To create large datasets necessary for these challenges, researchers typically employ a shared crowdsourcing task design for image captioning. This paper discusses findings from our thematic analysis of 1,064 comments left by Amazon Mechanical Turk workers using this task design to create captions for images taken by people who are blind. Workers discussed difficulties in understanding how to complete this task, provided suggestions of how to improve the task, gave explanations or clarifications about their work, and described why they found this particular task rewarding or interesting. Our analysis provides insights both into this particular genre of task as well as broader considerations for how to employ crowdsourcing to generate large datasets for developing AI algorithms. In the pursuit of automated AI solutions to scale up impact, we should not forget about the crowdsourced labor currently working ""behind the scenes"" to generate large datasets. While human crowdworkers are well suited to contribute, they understandably would like significant context for navigating the complexity of subjectivity in performing the tasks. Our findings are relevant both to improving the quality of the data generated by such tasks, as well as to improving the experience for workers. Better supporting crowdworkers in performing such tasks is not only an ethically and socially valuable goal in itself, but helping them to do better work can also create a virtuous cycle [96] whereby workers will be encouraged (and will encourage others) to continue successfully performing similar tasks in the future. Looking beyond the specific area of image captioning, the approach of integrating worker feedback as a necessary step in dataset creation can potentially be generalized to a variety of fields. Complementary ways for future work to solicit worker feedback include employing detailed ethnographic and observational studies of workers in order to generate real-time data about their experiences, as well as developing large-scale surveys to gain additional understanding of workersâ experiences. Ultimately, refining the design of such tasks to better support workersâ needs and goals can allow them to ""do their best,"" especially when workers ""hope [their work] is helpful."""
Leveraging Peer Support for Mature Immigrants Learning to Write in Informal Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415177,"For adult newcomers to countries such as Canada, learning language is more than an academic task. Language proficiency is their gateway to long-term economic and social stability, but limited access to resources contributes to systemic inequities which disproportionately place immigrants at socioeconomic disadvantages. Many new immigrants rely heavily on informal peer-networks to pursue avenues of success within an unfamiliar and inadequate system. To explore how we could leverage such a peer-based approach to meet their needs for feedback and support when learning to write in English, we deployed a peer-based writing app with 16 participants. Post-deployment focus groups and analysis of writing artifacts reveal that the design of writing support tools should present transparent feedback from both peers and automated sources, foster community through semi-structured discussions, incorporate guided review, and scaffold affective development. We discuss how incorporating these elements into the design of community learning platforms can address the language literacy needs of diverse immigrant learners and foster more positive experiences for newcomers as they negotiate their evolving identities. Highly-skilled immigrants often face a challenging search for employment and community, and are at high risk of facing social, cultural, and economic marginalization. Formal structures frequently fail to provide adequate support in preparing new immigrants, especially those no longer in school, for achieving their goals. Turning to the community for support has the potential to overcome the systemic barriers to success that these immigrants face. Our research focused on immigrants to Canada. However, many of the peer learning aspects are likely generalizable to other industrialized countries that have a similar skilled worker entry program for accepting highly educated immigrants. We explored the viability of peer-review based writing support tools to provide long-term support in informal learning contexts. We conducted an âin-the-wildâ evaluation of a collaborative learning tool for mature ELLs to understand both their performance and their perceptions of the peer-review process. From this we drew guidelines for developing a groupbased peer-review network rather than a dyadic peer review system. From our findings, we suggest three recommendations for designers of writing support tools for sustainable, semi-autonomous learning environments. We suggest mature ELLs should be presented with feedback from diverse sources where the justification is transparent, community should be fostered through open-ended discussion rather than imposing a formal structure for the peer-review, and finally, localized guidance is required for improving both technical and affective skills. For newcomers to a country, the process of learning language is also a process of reshaping identity and developing a sense of self within a new community [31]. Therefore, design for language learning should consider the wider, postcolonial context in which the language acquisition is situated [30]. We found that our mature ELLs are not âstudentsâ in the traditional sense, but rather, they are invested life-long learners who actively pursue new skills that bring them closer to their goals. As such, language learning tools should also foster positive selfgrowth. Mature ELLs should feel confident in making mistakes, providing honest feedback, and engaging in collaborative knowledge building in these spaces. When formal structures are unable to provide new immigrants with necessary resources, a collaborative learning platform that incorporates our guidelines can promote the reciprocal sharing of language learning guidance by leveraging skills within a network of peers."
Reconsidering Self-Moderation: the Role of Research in Supporting Community-Based Models for Online Content Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415178,"Research in online content moderation has a long history of exploring different forms that moderation can take, including both user-driven moderation models on community-based platforms like Wikipedia, Facebook Groups, and Reddit, and centralized corporate moderation models on platforms like Twitter and Instagram. In this work I review different approaches to moderation research with the goal of providing a roadmap for researchers studying community self-moderation. I contrast community-based moderation research with platforms and policies-focused moderation research, and argue that the former has an important role to play in shaping discussions about the future of online moderation. I provide six guiding questions for future research that, if answered, can support the development of a form of user-driven moderation that is widely implementable across a variety of social spaces online, offering an alternative to the corporate moderation models that dominate public debate and discussion. Though how Facebook and other platforms impact public discourse is far from a settled question, these authorsâ central points are fair; the moderation of public discourse under a centralized, profit-driven system deserves heavy scrutiny. Whether these models can truly achieve the values of transparency and accountability that have been articulated as goals for their future remains to be seen. As I have argued throughout this paper, though many recent, well-received pieces of research have focused exclusively on platform-driven moderation without considering alternative moderation models, the platform-driven model should not be treated as an inevitable outcome of the current trends; there are many forms of moderation that do not fall under this centralized model, and many of these systems already exist and have seen significant success. The modern world of social media, in its current, centrally-moderated form, is certainly not the internet-facilitated Utopia that we were promised, but an open-minded reconsideration of the core structures of the modern internet may lead us toward viable alternatives."
Exploring Antecedents and Consequences of Toxicity in Online Discussions: A Case Study on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415179,"Toxicity in online discussions has been an intriguing phenomenon and an important problem. In this paper, we seek to better understand toxicity dynamics in online discussions via a case study on Reddit that explores the antecedents and consequences of toxicity in text. We inspected two dimensions of toxicity: language toxicity, i.e. how toxic the text itself is; and toxicity elicitation, i.e. how much toxicity it elicits in its response. Through regression analyses on Reddit comments, we found that both author propensity and toxicity in discussion context were strong positive antecedents of language toxicity; meanwhile, language toxicity significantly increased the volume and user evaluation of the discussion in some sub-communities, while toxicity elicitation showed mixed effects. We then discuss how our results help understand and regulate toxicity in online discussions by interpreting the complicated triggers and outcomes of toxicity. We presented a study that explored the antecedents and consequences of toxicity â specifically language toxicity and toxicity elicitation â in online discussions, via quantitative analysis on Reddit comments. We found both author propensity and toxicity in discussion context to be strong antecedents of toxicity, and the volume and user evaluation of discussion to be positively correlated with language toxicity in some sub-communities. Our interpretation of the complicated triggers and outcomes of toxicity as well as the discussion of design implications should help understand and regulate toxicity in online discussions."
Supporting Youth Activists? Strategic Use of Social Media: A Qualitative Investigation of Design Opportunities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415180,"Social Networking Sites (SNS) provide a platform for engaging youth in activism (e.g., by helping mobilize civic action). While youth typically employ casual approaches to online activism (i.e., quick actions, such as broadcast posts to advertise social justice events), more strategic practices (i.e., those that are more creative and informed) can increase the likelihood of successful online campaigns. However, little work has examined how youth activists can be supported to use SNS more strategically. To address this research gap, we conducted interviews with youth activists, exploring how youth made sense of social network visualizations and their perspectives on how such tools could support their activism efforts. Our findings characterize how participants made inferences about followers? identities based on their hashtag use, and how they used those inferences in outreach decisions. We conclude with design implications for future research in this area. Youth activism online presents opportunities for youth development and for the voice of youth to be heard. However, to have impactful participation online, it is important to provide youth with tools to use SNS in strategic ways. Our study is a stepping stone for work that aims to create tools that help youth strategically navigate the social capital available in their network. Our findings revealed the importance of visualizing hashtag usage, as a means of supporting youth activistsâ decision-making. Future research should explore other aspects of oneâs network that might impact such decision making. One area in need of further research is the study of opportunities and challenges that the deployment of such tools over a prolonged period may present. Such work is necessary for a better understanding of how to augment youthâ experience using SNS for activism."
CrowdCog: A Cognitive Skill based System for Heterogeneous Task Assignment and Recommendation in Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415181,"While crowd workers typically complete a variety of tasks in crowdsourcing platforms, there is no widely accepted method to successfully match workers to different types of tasks. Researchers have considered using worker demographics, behavioural traces, and prior task completion records to optimise task assignment. However, optimum task assignment remains a challenging research problem due to limitations of proposed approaches, which in turn can have a significant impact on the future of crowdsourcing. We present 'CrowdCog', an online dynamic system that performs both task assignment and task recommendations, by relying on fast-paced online cognitive tests to estimate worker performance across a variety of tasks. Our work extends prior work that highlights the effect of workers' cognitive ability on crowdsourcing task performance. Our study, deployed on Amazon Mechanical Turk, involved 574 workers and 983 HITs that span across four typical crowd tasks (Classification, Counting, Transcription, and Sentiment Analysis). Our results show that both our assignment method and recommendation method result in a significant performance increase (5% to 20%) as compared to a generic or random task assignment. Our findings pave the way for the use of quick cognitive tests to provide robust recommendations and assignments to crowd workers. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous task assignment problem through a novel and online assignment and recommendation method. We propose the use of short online cognitive tests for dynamic task assignment in a crowdsourcing platform across a variety of tasks. We built the CrowdCog system by integrating our novel task assignment and recommendation framework with MTurk. We evaluate the system using a real world study involving 574 crowd workers and 983 HITs across four tasks. Our study compares the proposed task assignment and task recommendation methods with a baseline generic task assignment and reports significantly higher task accuracy in both cases. We also show Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 4, No. CSCW2, Article 110. Publication date: October 2020. CrowdCog 110:19 that the proposed methods are comparable in improving workerâs task accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art question assignment methods as well as a standard history-based qualification. At the same time, our method has a number of additional advantages, such as applicability to a variety of different tasks, not relying on historical performance data, and a better person-job fit which has been shown to lead to higher worker satisfaction [19]. Future work could explore a selection mechanism that takes into account the current task availability and cognitive test completion of the worker to further enhance the efficiency and productivity of the proposed method. Furthermore, once we have a list of eligible tasks for a worker, we randomly select a task from the list as opposed to the use of an optimised selection method. While this selection is less likely to impact the accuracy, an informed selection at this stage could further improve the efficiency of the data collection process. However, as both these enhancements dependent on various factors, future work in this domain will require a carefully crafted study design to account for the added complexity. In addition, a longitudinal study which investigates the frequency with which the cognitive tests should be repeated and the strategies for reusing cognitive tests will further strengthen the applicability of our findings."
Sochiatrist: Signals of Affect in Messaging Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415182,"Messaging is a common mode of communication, with conversations written informally between individuals. Interpreting emotional affect from messaging data can lead to a powerful form of reflection or act as a support for clinical therapy. Existing analysis techniques for social media commonly use LIWC and VADER for automated sentiment estimation. We correlate LIWC, VADER, and ratings from human reviewers with affect scores from 25 participants. We explore differences in how and when each technique is successful. Results show that human review does better than VADER, the best automated technique, when humans are judging positive affect ($r_s=0.45$ correlation when confident, $r_s=0.30$ overall). Surprisingly, human reviewers only do slightly better than VADER when judging negative affect ($r_s=0.38$ correlation when confident, $r_s=0.29$ overall). Compared to prior literature, VADER correlates more closely with PANAS scores for private messaging than public social media. Our results indicate that while any technique that serves as a proxy for PANAS scores has moderate correlation at best, there are some areas to improve the automated techniques by better considering context and timing in conversations. In this paper, we investigated the ability for sentiment analysis techniques to find an emotional signal in messaging data. Human review, especially when the reviewers were confident, had the highest correlation with PANAS, while VADER achieved similar correlation for negative affect. VADER, outperforming LIWC, is reasonably accurate for predicting affect, but does so differently than human review, as the correlation between the two is low. Both human review and VADER performed well on messaging data in comparison to past studies, most of which used public social media data. VADERâs relatively strong performance when using messaging data supports a more in depth investigation of the difference between private messages and public social media posts. However, it should be noted that all correlations with PANAS, while many were significant, had only moderate strength at best. We would caution against treating any of these methods as a replacement for user-reported affect data gathered through PANAS. What is perhaps most promising in the future is identifying the parts of human review that the automated techniques perform poorly in. Due to the evidence that human reviewers have the ability to gauge when they are likely more accurate, there must be some explanatory signal that the current automated techniques are not yet catching. Human reviewers are able to interpret both context and timing, and moderate the message based on the social relationship, likely playing a role in this. These discrepancies indicate opportunities for better sentiment analysis in the future, which could feature measures that are currently only noticed by humans."
The Patient Advice System: A Technology Probe Study to Enable Peer Support in the Hospital,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415183,"Although peer support technologies are critical resources for patients managing health conditions, they do not address the needs of patients in the hospital (i.e., inpatients) or the unique design constraints of this healthcare setting. To examine how the design of these technologies can meet the needs of inpatients, we conducted a technology probe study with 30 pediatric and adult inpatients. We created the Patient Advice System (PAS) to enable peer support in the hospital setting, then studied how participants used and perceived it during their stay. Inpatients used the PAS to exchange emotional support and share peer advice on a range of topics (e.g., adjusting to the hospital, communicating with providers). They identified several benefits (e.g., fostered connections) and challenges (e.g., competing clinical priorities) with using the PAS in the real-world context of their hospital stay. Based on our findings, we discuss three design opportunities-highlighting local expertise, designing for dynamic engagement, and providing alternative modes of peer support-for future peer support technologies to empower inpatients and overcome the difficulties they face within the hospital. We present a technology probe study we conducted to explore inpatientsâ use and perception of the PAS, an in-hospital peer support technology probe. We found that participants adopted different user rolesâincluding storytellers, commenters, and upvotersâon the PAS. Pediatric and adult participants formed distinct social interaction patterns based on their use of commenting and upvoting features. These participants exchanged informational and emotional support on a range of topics, such as adjusting to the hospital, understanding their care, and preventing and reporting medical errors. Furthermore, we describe factors, like fostered peer connections and competing clinical priorities, that helped and hindered inpatientsâ use of the PAS during their hospital stay. We discuss three novel design opportunities: (1) highlighting local expertise, (2) designing for dynamic engagement, and (3) providing alternative modes of peer support. These insights provide guidance for future inpatient peer support technologies to increase inpatientsâ knowledge, self-efficacy, and empowerment during their hospital stay."
Gender Differences in Graphic Design Q&As: How Community and Site Characteristics Contribute to Gender Gaps in Answering Questions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415184,"Question and answer (Q&A) sites can capture a range of user perspectives on using complex, feature-rich software. Little is known, however, on who is contributing to the sites. We look at contribution diversity from the perspective of gender in a domain with near gender parity: graphic design. Through content analysis of 330 answers from two popular Q&A sites and semi-structured interviews with 24 graphic designers, we examine who is contributing, what content, how the community shows appreciation towards their answers, and perceived motivations and barriers to participation. We find that despite gender balance in the field, women contribute far less frequently than men. We also see gender differences in contribution styles and user appreciation. Our interviews shed further light on how Q&A community cultures might be impacting men and women differently and how design choices made by the sites? developers might be exacerbating these differences. We suggest implications for design for improving gender inclusivity. In this paper, we present findings from content analysis of two Q&A sites for graphic designers containing both technical and opinion-oriented content and follow-up interviews that answer the question of whether or not men and women are participating equally. Our findings reveal differences in the content and perspectives between men and women who use and participate in these sites, as well as how certain platform dynamics seem to be impacting men and women differently. These results highlight the importance of considering gender in software learning research and tool development and suggest exciting opportunities for the HCI community to work toward technologies that are more gender inclusive."
Understanding the Role of Intermediaries in Online Social E-commerce: An Exploratory Study of Beidian,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415185,"Social e-commerce, as a new form of social computing based marketing platforms, utilizes existing real-world social relationships for promotions and sales of products. It has been growing rapidly in recent years and attracted tens of millions of users in China. A key group of actors who enable market transactions on these platforms are intermediaries who connect producers with consumers by sharing information with and recommending products to their real-world social contacts. Despite their crucial role, the nature and behavior of these intermediaries on these social e-commerce platforms has not been systematically analyzed. Here we address this knowledge gap through a mixed method study. Leveraging 9 months' all-round behavior of about 40 million users on Beidian -- one of the largest social e-commerce sites in China, alongside with qualitative evidence from online forums and interviews, we examine characteristics of intermediaries, identify their behavioral patterns and uncover strategies and mechanisms that make successful intermediaries. We demonstrate that intermediaries on social e-commerce sites act as local trend detectors and ""social grocers''. Furthermore, successful intermediaries are highly dedicated whenever best sellers appear and broaden items for promotion. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis on the emerging role of intermediaries in social e-commerce platforms, which provides potential insights for the design and management of social computing marketing platforms. This paper presents the first analysis on the role of intermediaries in social e-commerce through the combination of quantitative explorations and qualitative analysis. We highlight characteristics of intermediaries, identify successful intermediaries and analyze factors contributing to becoming successful intermediaries. We demonstrate that they take the role of 1) detecting and promoting local trends; and 2) selling in a convenience-store manner to socially-connected consumers. We show that to become more successful intermediaries, one should actively devote to promoting best sellers and broaden their sales in a social grocer manner. Our work points to the interesting nature of behaviors and sales on this new form of social e-commerce, which contributes to a better understanding of computer-supported cooperative work and social computing based marketing platforms."
Between Subjectivity and Imposition: Power Dynamics in Data Annotation for Computer Vision,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415186,"The interpretation of data is fundamental to machine learning. This paper investigates practices of image data annotation as performed in industrial contexts. We define data annotation as a sense-making practice, where annotators assign meaning to data through the use of labels. Previous human-centered investigations have largely focused on annotators? subjectivity as a major cause of biased labels. We propose a wider view on this issue: guided by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted several weeks of fieldwork at two annotation companies. We analyzed which structures, power relations, and naturalized impositions shape the interpretation of data. Our results show that the work of annotators is profoundly informed by the interests, values, and priorities of other actors above their station. Arbitrary classifications are vertically imposed on annotators, and through them, on data. This imposition is largely naturalized. Assigning meaning to data is often presented as a technical matter. This paper shows it is, in fact, an exercise of power with multiple implications for individuals and society. This paper has presented a constructivist grounded theory investigation of the sensemaking of data as performed by data annotators. Based on several weeks of fieldwork at two companies and interviews with annotators, managers, and computer vision practitioners, we have described structures and standards that influence the classification and labeling of data. We aimed at contesting the supposed neutrality of data-driven systems by setting the spotlight on the power dynamics that inform data creation. We found that workersâ subjectivity is structurally constrained and profoundly shaped by classifications imposed by actors above annotatorsâ station. Briefings, annotation guidelines, and quality control all aim at meeting the demands of clients and the market. We have argued that the creation of datasets follows the logics of cost effectiveness, optimization of workersâ output, and standardization of labels, often at the expense of ethical considerations. We have observed the presence of multiple instances of classification, with diverse actors among several hierarchical layers that are related to the possession of capital. We have argued that the many layers, actors, and iterations involved contribute to the imposition of meaning and, finally, to the dilution of responsibilities and accountability for the possible harms caused by arbitrary labels. Furthermore, our findings have shown that workers naturalize the imposed classifications as well as the epistemic authority of those actors higher in the hierarchy. Our observations indicate that power asymmetries, which are inherent to labor relations and to the service relationship between annotation companies and their clients, fundamentally shape labels, datasets, and systems. We have furthermore discussed implications for practitioners and researchers and advocated for the adoption of a power-aware perspective to document actors and rationale behind the meanings assigned to data in annotation work. Finally, we have emphasized the importance of adopting a similar power-aware perspective in the CSCW research agenda, not only as a possible focus for future work but also as a tool for reflecting on researchersâ own position and power."
Tangible Privacy: Towards User-Centric Sensor Designs for Bystander Privacy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415187,"Sensor-enabled computers in the form of 'IoT' devices such as home security cameras and voice assistants are increasingly becoming pervasive in our environment. With the embedded cameras and microphones in these devices, this 'invasion' of our everyday spaces can pose significant threats to the privacy of bystanders. Because of their complex functionality, even when people attempt privacy measures (such as asking the owner to ""turn the camera off""), these devices may still record information because of the lack of a 'real' off button. With the ambiguities of current designs, a bystander's perceived privacy can diverge from their actual privacy. Indeed, being able to assess one's actual privacy is a key aspect in managing one's privacy according to Altman's theory of boundary regulation, and current designs fall short in assuring people of their privacy. To understand how people as bystanders manage their privacy with IoT devices, we conducted an interview study about people's perceptions of and behaviors around current IoT devices. We find that although participants' behaviors line up with Altman's theory of boundary regulation, in the face of uncertainty about their privacy, they desire or engage in various 'tangible' workarounds. Based on our findings, we identify and introduce the concept of 'tangible privacy' as being essential to boundary regulation with IoT devices. We argue that IoT devices should be designed in a way that clearly and unambiguously conveys sensor states to people around them and make actionable design recommendations to provide strong privacy assurances to bystanders. Based on our study of how people manage their privacy around IoT devices, we identify and introduce the concept of âtangible privacyâ as an important consideration in the design of IoT devices. Tangible privacy mechanisms provide people with a way to clearly and unambiguously control and discern privacy states of IoT devices in their vicinity. Current designs do not provide adequate assurances to bystanders, who are unable to clearly ascertain whether they are being recorded by a camera or microphone. Through our interview study, we find that current designs lead to an uncertainty about device states (e.g., whether they are indeed âonâ or âoffâ or in some intermediate âstand-byâ state and able to record data) and confusion about features such as what LEDs mean. This uncertainty, along with the mistrust of software controls, also lead people to improvise their own privacy mechanisms such as covering cameras with other objects and even attempting to muffle microphones. We also found that people can underestimate their privacy risks by overly focusing on the primary function of the device and sometimes not being aware of microphones on video-focused IoT devices and vice versa. A major contribution of our work is the call for adopting hardware mechanisms in an attempt to provide bystanders with the required assurance of their privacy. Our findings inspire various design principles for the design of future IoT devices. Designers should strive to design mechanisms that provide clear and unambiguous feedback through âtangible privacyâ mechanisms. Their devices should convey clarity on their âonâ/âoffâ states, and designers should recognize the limitations of LEDs (they should be seen as necessary but not sufficient). Cameras should support shutter mechanisms for obscuring the camera, and microphones, in particular, need special attention because their current embedded designs do not seem to offer any easy ways of being obscured. Future microphones need to be designed so that they can be easily â and tangibly â disabled on devices. Future, novel designs could consider modular designs where sensors can be easily removed or reattached based on peopleâs privacy preferences. Finally, IoT devices should support a negotiation of privacy between people in the vicinity. Although much work has studied such privacy negotiation, more research is needed on how devices can be reconfigured for tangibility. Overall, we hope that our work inspires future research on designs for âtangible privacyâ, which we posit is a necessary component for managing privacy in todayâs socio-technical physical spaces."
A Seat at the Table: Black Feminist Thought as a Critical Framework for Inclusive Game Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415188,"Game-based second language (L2) learning represents an ideal alternative to foreign language classroom instruction. However, despite a diverse player demographic, the design of L2 games is often not informed by players representative of marginalized populations, especially women of color (i.e., Black women). Such oversight in the design process contributes to games that perpetuate gendered and racist stereotypes, and therefore, are less appealing to women of color. In response this dilemma, we utilize Black Feminist Thought (BFT) as a critical framework to engage Black women, a marginalized and understudied population within the gaming subculture, and more broadly, the Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) community in game design. Twenty-five Black women take on multiple roles as game designers, foreign language instructor, and informants who represent both producers and consumers throughout the conceptualization phase of a L2 mobile game prototype. Applying BFT principles, we leverage Black women\textquotesingle s lived intersectional experiences to transform the traditional game design process into a more inclusive design experience for Black women. In the context of games that support L2 learning, our findings reveal that Black women appreciate games that: 1. provide authentic cultural experiences; 2. feature intersectional game characters that reflect real life experiences; 3. accurately portray the diversity of Black women's bodies; and 4. provide opportunities for players to customize game assets. As a disruptor to traditional game design, BFT makes salient oppressive design practices within the gaming culture that also extend to the larger CSCW community, signifying the need to embrace more inclusive design practices that benefit Black women and other marginalized populations. We apply Black Feminist Thought (BFT) as a critical framework to engage Black women in the co-design process of the L2 mobile game ""Bienvenido a Mi Cocina!"" - ""Welcome to My Kitchen!"", a game designed to promote Spanish vocabulary acquisition. BFT, as a framework for inclusive game design, leverages the historical legacy and agency of Black women in the United States, positioning them front and center in the discourse about their intersectional experiences. Black women game designers relied on sociocultural norms (i.e., Black women sitting and talking around the kitchen table) to inform the initial design of the L2 game prototype. As informants, Black women generated several suggestions, including more accurately representing the diversity of Black womenâs bodies in Black women game characters, game options that promote customization of game assets, and additional game characters that reflect intersectional experiences of race, gender, sexuality and nationality indicative of Spanish speaking populations. Finally, it is not enough to simply engage Black women in game design. BFT, as a critical framework that promotes inclusivity, requires us to address the very social injustices that affect Black women and other marginalized population who are often overlooked in the early stages of game design or only considered when evaluating or playtesting games. Instead, we invite those interested in designing games that appeal to a broad player demographic to seek out Black women as a valuable segment of the player population, developing an appreciation for our unique perspective. Such efforts will begin to address the systemic oppression of Black women in gaming and contribute towards a more inclusive gaming subculture and CSCW community."
Chatbot-based Emotion Management for Distributed Teams: A Participatory Design Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415189,"Fueled by the pervasion of tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, the usage of text-based communication in distributed teams has grown massively in organizations. This brings distributed teams many advantages, however, a critical shortcoming in these setups is the decreased ability of perceiving, understanding and regulating emotions. This is problematic because better team members? abilities of emotion management positively impact team-level outcomes like team cohesion and team performance, while poor abilities diminish communication flow and well-being. Leveraging chatbot technology in distributed teams has been recognized as a promising approach to reintroduce and improve upon these abilities. In this article we present three chatbot designs for emotion management for distributed teams. In order to develop these designs, we conducted three participatory design workshops which resulted in 153 sketches. Subsequently, we evaluated the designs following an exploratory evaluation with 27 participants. Results show general stimulating effects on emotion awareness and communication efficiency. Further, they report emotion regulation and increased compromise facilitation through social and interactive design features, but also perceived threats like loss of control. With some design features adversely impacting emotion management, we highlight design implications and discuss chatbot design recommendations for enhancing emotion management in teams. In this study we conducted the design, implementation, and evaluation of chatbot-based EM in text-based communication for distributed teams. Based on participatory design workshops we developed three chatbot designs: NeutralBot, neutrally reporting, SocialBot, anthropomorphic and socially engaging, and ActionBot, actively intervening. We evaluated the designs in a mixed-method laboratory experiment with 27 participants. The findings report stimulation of emotion awareness and communication efficiency through all chatbot designs, and especially an increase in emotion regulation and compromise facilitation through social (SBT) and interactive (ABT) design features. These design features were appreciated, however, for all designs situating constraints limit the effectiveness, e.g. contextual factors (timing, accuracy, time-pressure), too obtrusive interventions (content deletion, large images), and too neutral messages (missing explanations) were confusing and disturbing. Thereby, a combination of design features makes sense to improve positive effects and mitigate potential downsides. Besides positive results, we found support for threats by chatbots through perceived surveillance and loss of control. Concluding Remarks regarding COVID-19. The importance of these findings should be critically appraised against the backdrop of present societal changes. Since distancing measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have taken effect, the global workforce has vitally relied on collaboration software (e.g. Slack, Microsoft Teams). As our work is closely related, we present a few concluding thoughts about the opportunities of chatbot-based EM in this new future of work. In the past months, home-office work configurations have been pivotal and they have been accompanied by a series of challenging developments in terms of emotional experiences (e.g. [7, 51]). Some developments stand out: With primarily remote collaboration, communication exchange becomes shorter (cf. [52]) and focuses towards mandatory, official meetings. In consequence, individual isolation appears to increase since social-emotional communication might decrease. This may lead to psychologically detrimental experiences like loneliness as well as impaired leadership. For the future of collaborative software it requires to counterbalance this structural change. Chatbot-based EM could provide means for this by strengthening social bonds in distributed teams, for example through providing space for traversing missing emotional information and diminishing emotional shortcomings. Further, reduced or artificial social interaction may lead to emotional disengagement from work. With this development the motivation to collaborate might shrink, too. Therefore, chatbots with emotional capabilities could provide a mean to positively influence work motivation in distributed teams. In summary we propose, that many of the presently unfolding challenges for the now broader remote workforce are related to social interaction and, thereby, to EM. Chatbot-based EM support mechanisms could therefore play a vital role in making the shift from artificial and cold virtual interaction to an emotionally rich and functional digital workplace of the future."
Studying Politeness across Cultures using English Twitter and Mandarin Weibo,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415190,"Modeling politeness across cultures helps to improve intercultural communication by uncovering what is considered appropriate and polite. We study the linguistic features associated with politeness across American English and Mandarin Chinese. First, we annotate 5,300 Twitter posts from the United States (US) and 5,300 Sina Weibo posts from China for politeness scores. Next, we develop an English and Chinese politeness feature set, 'PoliteLex'. Combining it with validated psycholinguistic dictionaries, we study the correlations between linguistic features and perceived politeness across cultures. We find that on Mandarin Weibo, future-focusing conversations, identifying with a group affiliation, and gratitude are considered more polite compared to English Twitter. Death-related taboo topics, use of pronouns (with the exception of honorifics), and informal language are associated with higher impoliteness on Mandarin Weibo than on English Twitter. Finally, we build language-based machine learning models to predict politeness with an F1 score of 0.886 on Mandarin Weibo and 0.774 on English Twitter. In this paper, we showed that PoliteLex, combined with LIWC and EmoLex, can outperform the Stanford API [11] in predicting politeness on social media corpus and the Stanford politeness corpus [11]. We also studied the similarities and differences in politeness expressions across English Twitter and Mandarin Weibo and found several categories of PoliteLex to be significantly associated with politeness on both platforms. Several correlations mapped onto known psycho-social differences across US and Chinese cultures. For example, use of all pronouns (except honorifics) highly correlates with impoliteness in Weibo, echoing the fact that Chinese is a pro-drop language, one that frequently omits pronouns [24]. On Weibo, future-focusing conversations, identifying with a group affiliation, and gratitude are considered to be polite compared to English Twitter. Death-related taboo topics and informal language are associated with higher impoliteness on Mandarin Weibo compared to English Twitter."
Advisory Service Support that Works: Enhancing Service Quality with a Mixed-reality System,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415191,"Modern information technology promises to improve service encounters through automated documentation or better decision traceability. At the same time, research suggests a negative impact of technology on human-to-human advisory services: including the possibility that computers might degrade the quality of interpersonal communication and reinforce unpleasant behaviors. Consequently, despite obvious improvements, information technology might have a negative impact on how the participants perceive the service. This might imply serious consequences for the service provider: dissatisfied clients, ineffective information exchange, and/or lack of transparency. This scenario slows down the diffusion of computers into advisory services in banks and insurance companies, and so designing systems for use in interpersonal services remains a challenge. This article provides evidence that LivePaper, a system designed alongside the material practices of a financial advisory encounter, helps to improve important service quality dimensions, making the services not only more pleasant for the participants, but also improving key marketing and business metrics of the service. In experimental advisory services, the sessions supported with LivePaper outperformed conventional services with regard to overall bank service quality and satisfaction, salesperson listening and interaction rating scores, as well as information transparency. This shows that a carefully designed system not only preserves the perceived quality of a service, but might improve it objectively, and has implications for the marketing and business value of the service. In summary, the current study offers a major improvement concerning the support of advisory services in financial institutions and beyond. We claim that LivePaper can be used as a framework for further, focused applications addressing more specific challenges in the advisory scenario without the risk of disrupting the interpersonal relationship or making the encounter lack transparency, or simply be less satisfactory for the client. However, the frontline service scenario bears potential for further CSCW research: Artificial intelligence is expected to change the way services are provided, yet the vision of a robot as a frontline employee is strange or inadequate for many clients. LivePaper offers a way to combine the potential of current-stage artificial intelligence (quick fact checking, generation of multiple scenarios and predictions) with a fully-fledged interpersonal encounter. In an era of self-service and robo advisors, a premium frontline experience combining human-to-human and human-to-machine collaboration might be an important asset. However, it remains unclear how clients will perceive such hybrid encounters, how the roles should be distributed between human and non-human actors, and what rituals should be supported and how. We claim that interpersonal services will not disappear, but their character will necessarily change and CSCW is predestined to go along with the transformation while attending to the effects on humans, the organization, and society."
Middle-Aged Video Consumers' Beliefs About Algorithmic Recommendations on YouTube,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415192,"User beliefs about algorithmic systems are constantly co-produced through user interaction and the complex socio-technical systems that generate recommendations. Identifying these beliefs is crucial because they influence how users interact with recommendation algorithms. With no prior work on user beliefs of algorithmic video recommendations, practitioners lack relevant knowledge to improve the user experience of such systems. To address this problem, we conducted semi-structured interviews with middle-aged YouTube video consumers to analyze their user beliefs about the video recommendation system. Our analysis revealed different factors that users believe influence their recommendations. Based on these factors, we identified four groups of user beliefs: Previous Actions, Social Media, Recommender System, and Company Policy. Additionally, we propose a framework to distinguish the four main actors that users believe influence their video recommendations: the current user, other users, the algorithm, and the organization. This framework provides a new lens to explore design suggestions based on the agency of these four actors. It also exposes a novel aspect previously unexplored: the effect of corporate decisions on the interaction with algorithmic recommendations. While we found that users are aware of the existence of the recommendation system on YouTube, we show that their understanding of this system is limited. This paper presents the first overview of middle-aged video consumersâ beliefs about YouTubeâs algorithmic video recommendations. The analysis identified four groups of user beliefs that describe how users understand video recommendations on YouTube: Previous Actions, Social Media, Recommender System, and Company Policy. For each user belief, we identified several influence factors recognized by users which could help designers improve the experience of video recommendations. To enable solutions to this problem, we systematically analyzed the different influence factors and identified four dominant user beliefs that we relate to different actors. Users recognize these influences without having a background in technology. We invite further studies on the complex socio-technical context of recommender systems using this framework, including how the organization that operates the recommendation system influences the user experience with the recommendations."
A Dramaturgical Approach to Online Activism within Youth Empowerment Organizations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415193,"Social Networking Sites (SNS) offer youth activists and youth empowerment organizations (where adults help youth address community issues) opportunities for civic action. Impression management is critical to youth empowerment organizations' work online, as they attempt to influence the opinions of their audience. However, there is a dearth of research characterizing online impression management in the context of youth empowerment organizations. To address this research gap, we conducted a qualitative study investigating the use of SNS in a youth empowerment organization. Using Goffman's dramaturgical model, we characterized how youth tried to hack SNS algorithms, and their desire to better identify their audience. Our findings reveal how youth use SNS to create authentic images and connections with their audience. On the other hand, we discuss adults' desire to convey a curated organizational image and challenges that arose. We conclude with design implications for tools that support impression management online for youth activists. In this study, we examined the activist work of a youth empowerment organization through Goffmanâs dramaturgical framework. We specifically explored how these organizations engaged in impression management on SNS. Our findings revealed the challenges staff members faced in creating a planned and unified front stage for the organization. Additionally, we characterized youthâs desire to connect to their audiences through the use of various social networking features and their desire to learn about their audience. We finally presented recommendations for future studies to explore how interventions could support the work of youth activists on SNS (e.g., exploring the role of collective impression management within youth empowerment organizations)."
From Lost to Found: Discover Missing UI Design Semantics through Recovering Missing Tags,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415194,"Design sharing sites provide UI designers with a platform to share their works and also an opportunity to get inspiration from others' designs. To facilitate management and search of millions of UI design images, many design sharing sites adopt collaborative tagging systems by distributing the work of categorization to the community. However, designers often do not know how to properly tag one design image with compact textual description, resulting in unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent tags for uploaded examples which impede retrieval, according to our empirical study and interview with four professional designers. Based on a deep neural network, we introduce a novel approach for encoding both the visual and textual information to recover the missing tags for existing UI examples so that they can be more easily found by text queries. We achieve 82.72% accuracy in the tag prediction. Through a simulation test of 5 queries, our system on average returns hundreds more results than the default Dribbble search, leading to better relatedness, diversity and satisfaction. UI is crucial for the success of the software especially for mobile apps in the market. Albeit a large number of UI designs online with human tags, many UIs are still missing some closely related keywords for retrieval. To assist designers with better UI design retrieval, we adopt a deep learning method to automatically recommend additional tags that convey the semantics of the UI. Based on the systematical analysis of the existing large-scale UI designs, our model can achieve the accuracy as 0.827 which significantly outperforms other baselines. The user study also demonstrates the usefulness of our model in UI retrieval. In the future, we are extending our research works into three different directions. On the one hand, we are diving into the model to improve the current accuracy performance. Currently, we only evaluate our model on tags which have many related UI as the training data, and we will also customize our model for achieving good performance on tags with only small datasets. On the other hand, we are exploring the searching for dynamic animation UI designs. According to our observation, apart from the static UI design images, there are also some animation designs in GIF format which show how users interact with the UI dynamically. We will leverage the video analysis method to analyze the human actions and design interactions within those GIFs, so that designers can search the animation with textual queries. Furthermore, to understand the usefulness of our technology in a real design context, we hope to cooperate with professional designers and design sharing sites by deploying our model. We will explore how designers actually make use of the retrieved UIs, and collect valuable feedback to improve our technology and evaluation methods."
"Trans Time: Safety, Privacy, and Content Warnings on a Transgender-Specific Social Media Site",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415195,"Trans people often use social media to connect with others, find and share resources, and post transition-related content. However, because most social media platforms are not built with trans people in mind and because online networks include people who may not accept one's trans identity, sharing trans content can be difficult. We studied Trans Time, a social media site developed particularly for trans people to document transition and build community. We interviewed early Trans Time users (n = 6) and conducted focus groups with potential users (n = 21) to understand how a trans-specific site uniquely supports its users. We found that Trans Time has the potential to be a safe space, encourages privacy, and effectively enables its users to selectively view content using content warnings. Together, safety, privacy, and content warnings create an online space where trans people can simultaneously build community, find support, and express both the mundanity and excitement of trans life. Yet in each of these areas, we also learned ways that the site can improve. We provide implications for how social media sites may better support trans users, as well as insular communities of people from other marginalized groups. We talked with current and potential users of Trans Time, a social media site created specifcally for trans and/or non-binary people to document their transitions and build community, to understand how social media sites can support trans peopleâs needs. While some aspects of the site are similar to social media sites built for the general population, Trans Timeâs specifc community focus makes it unique in several ways. The insulated community, active moderation, and the values instilled in its guidelines and policies meant that participants considered the site a potentially safe space. Additionally, the siteâs privacy features enabled the audience segmentation necessary for people during and after gender transition. Finally, we learned from participants how Trans Timeâs content warnings can be designed with enough granularity to address the communityâs needs. Taken together, safety, privacy, and content warnings create a site that uniquely meets the needs of trans people, and enables them to fnd support, build community, and express both the exciting and mundane aspects of being trans. By examining Trans Time via Kraut and Resnickâs [53] design claims for online communities, we determined ways the site is similar to online communities more broadly (e.g., the need to uphold community norms and values and practice community boundary management), yet with important diferences (e.g., Trans Timeâs focus on small size rather than rapid membership increase, and the importance of changeable rather than static user identities for trans users). Our design recommendations, beyond providing guidance for Trans Time, detail ways other social media sites may be able to better support the marginalized individuals and communities who use their sites, and ways that sites can be designed to support specifc marginalized online communities."
Social App Accessibility for Deaf Signers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415196,"Social media platforms support the sharing of written text, video, and audio. All of these formats may be inaccessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing (DHH), particularly those who primarily communicate via sign language, people who we call Deaf signers. We study how Deaf signers engage with social platforms, focusing on how they share content and the barriers they face. We employ a mixed-methods approach involving seven in-depth interviews and a survey of a larger population (n = 60). We find that Deaf signers share the most in written English, despite their desire to share in sign language. We further identify key areas of difficulty in consuming content (e.g., lack of captions for spoken content in videos) and producing content (e.g., captioning signed videos, signing into a phone camera) on social media platforms. Our results both provide novel insights into social media use by Deaf signers and reinforce prior findings on DHH communication more generally, while revealing potential ways to make social media platforms more accessible to Deaf signers. We investigated how social media platforms can better accommodate Deaf signers by asking 67 individuals about how they share and the barriers they face on popular platforms. We provide depth to current literature on DHH social media use by focusing specifcally on Deaf signers, their sharing behaviors on a variety of platforms, who they share with, and why they choose to share with the methods they do. While many Deaf signers prefer to share in sign language, they resort to sharing in English on platforms due to barriers in sharing videos. We discuss in depth these novel barriers including difculty in creating captions, difculty flming sign, and language barriers. Based on the insights found in this study, we present many feasible changes for platforms and areas for future research to better support Deaf signers. We hope this work inspires similar in-depth explorations of the Deaf communityâs unique usage of various interfaces."
On the Desiderata for Online Altruism: Nudging for Equitable Donations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415197,"Online donation platforms help equalize access to opportunity and funding in cases where inequalities exist. In the context of public school education in the United States, for instance, financial inequalities have been shown to be reflected in the educational system, since schools are primarily funded through local property taxes. In response, private charitable donation platforms such as DonorsChoose.org have emerged seeking to alleviate systemic inequalities. Yet, the question remains of how effective these platforms are in redressing existing funding inequalities across school districts. Our analysis of donation data from DonorsChoose shows that such platforms may in fact be ineffective in mitigating existing inequalities or may even exacerbate them. In this paper, we explore how online educational charities could direct more funding towards more impoverished schools without compromising their donors' freedom of choice with respect to donation targets. Seeking to answer this question, we draw on the line of work on choice architectures in behavioral economics and pose a novel research question on the impact of interface design on equity in socio-technical systems. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate how simple interface design interventions - such as modifying default rankings or displaying additional information about schools - might lead to changes in donation distributions helping platforms direct more funding towards schools in need. Going beyond online educational charities, we hope that our work will bring attention to the role of interface design nudges in the social requirements of online altruism."
Roles in the Discussion: An Analysis of Social Support in an Online Forum for People with Dementia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415198,"Social computing provides a variety of challenges and opportunities for people who are experiencing cognitive decline. Following a recent diagnosis of dementia, older adults sometimes engage in online communities designated for people with dementia. In this work, we analyzed all original posts from a seven-year period on a forum for persons with dementia to understand 1) who posts in this forum and 2) what kinds of social support posters seek to gain from this engagement. Our analyses indicate that, in addition to people with dementia, a variety of dementia-related stakeholders create original posts in this forum. Our results suggest that seeking and offering social support are key activities for all forum users, not just those with dementia for whom the forum was designated. Given these findings, we offer design implications for online spaces for vulnerable communities, with a focus on design that allows for external stakeholder participation while still maintaining the privacy and safety of vulnerable members of the community. This paper describes the results of a research project in which we analyzed the roles of individuals posting on a forum for PWD. Original posters inhabited a variety of roles, seeking and providing social support in this online community. The publicâincluding family, friends, and caregiversâsought more support than they provided. This imbalance has the potential, particularly over time, to overload the PWD with explaining and comforting others about their disease. Our findings also indicate that posters who were not able to be identified as PWD or FFC provided more support than they sought, indicating the potential benefits of including such people in a forum that was not created for them in the first place. Based on these findings, we propose a model to streamline posts by people without dementia and create a safe space for those with dementia. Although the forum studied in this work is designated for PWD, the public (i.e. family, caregivers, friends, and people with no relation to the disease) could all benefit from the conversation. In the future, researchers, designers, and developers alike must find ways to support all of these various stakeholders in participating without burdening the most vulnerable members of the community. The model we present here should be tested for PWD as well as other similar communities coping with long-term disability or illness. These platforms must then be tested for their appropriateness, utility, and level of respect they afford to both the vulnerable population themselves and their allies. A variety of additional supports, both in terms of human policy and intelligent systems, will likely be needed to bring such a model fully to fruition. However, parts of it can work with existing tools. Future research should seek to develop these new tools as well as test this model with existing ones. Finally, in this work, we identify a variety of challenges that could arise in moderation of spaces for PWD. This works serves as a base model to understanding how we can design online communities with focal points not just for PWD, but also other vulnerable communities. In our future work, we will seek to expand this model following additional analyses, such as of responses to original posters and in other communities, as well as through testing functional platforms."
Religion and Sustainability: Lessons of Sustainable Computing from Islamic Religious Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415199,"While persuasion has often been considered an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. This criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. We join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. Based on our six-month long ethnography with the Islamic communities in a Bangladeshi city, Kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. Drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how Islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. We further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of CSCW literature in the various domains."
Sociocultural Dimensions of Tracking Health and Taking Care,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415200,"The field of personal health informatics has received increasing attention within the CSCW and HCI communities as health tracking becomes more affordable, accessible, and pervasive. Chronic disease management, in particular, presents tremendous potential for intervention given patients' ability to now actively participate in their care through tracking. The focus on 'personal' in health informatics, however, obfuscates the role of other cultural and ecological factors that might shape health tracking behaviors, and important information from alternative sources could be ignored by virtue of being subjective, complex, or simply hard to collect. To dig deeper into these negative spaces that may go untracked, uncover potential sources of important health information, and more completely understand current tracking practices, we embarked on an interview study with patients with cardiac diseases in Bangalore, India. In this paper, we present these patients' current health management approaches that are culturally situated, identifying both motivations and barriers to tracking, their attitudes towards online information, as well as cultural and ecological influences on their perceptions of cardiac care. We then discuss the interplay between our findings and current notions of, and approaches towards, patient empowerment and datafication of health. CSCW literature is increasingly exploring the socioculturally situated nature of health tracking. We extend this work by highlighting the technological, personal, interpersonal, and ecological factors that influence health tracking. In this paper, we presented a qualitative inquiry with 18 patients with cardiac diseases and 8 doctors in Bangalore, India to reveal how health tracking practices are informed by the individualsâ attitudes towards health information, the dynamics of patient-doctor interactions and sociocultural norms. We argue that our findings have implications on patient-centered care and patient empowerment, as well as devising data-driven insights for healthcare."
"Combating Misinformation in Bangladesh: Roles and Responsibilities as Perceived by Journalists, Fact-checkers, and Users",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415201,"There has been a growing interest within CSCW community in understanding the characteristics of misinformation propagated through computational media, and the devising techniques to address the associated challenges. However, most work in this area has been concentrated on the cases in the western world leaving a major portion of this problem unaddressed that is situated in the Global South. This paper aims to broaden the scope of this discourse by focusing on this problem in the context of Bangladesh, a country in the Global South. The spread of misinformation on Facebook in Bangladesh, a country with a population of over 163 million, has resulted in chaos, hate attacks, and killings. By interviewing journalists, fact-checkers, in addition to surveying the general public, we analyzed the current state of verifying misinformation in Bangladesh. Our findings show that most people in the 'news audience' want the news media to verify the authenticity of online information that they see online. However, the newspaper journalists say that fact-checking online information is not a part of their job, and it is also beyond their capacity given the amount of information being published online every day. We further find that the voluntary fact-checkers in Bangladesh are not equipped with sufficient infrastructural support to fill in this gap. We show how our findings are connected to some of the core concerns of CSCW community around social media, collaboration, infrastructural politics, and information inequality. From our analysis, we also suggest several pathways to increase the impact of fact-checking efforts through collaboration, technology design, and infrastructure development. In this study, we have examined how multiple entities - journalists, fact-checkers, and internet users - in Bangladesh have experienced and confronted online misinformation with limited resource, freedom of press, and access to information. We have reported the communication gap between journalists and fact-checkers that resulted in a lack of defined responsibility of who should factcheck online misinformation. We also have identified several verification strategies of regular users. Our findings provide several design and policy implications, and suggest the need for development of computational tools and increasing cooperative work to combat misinformation in the developing world."
Quantifying the Causal Effects of Conversational Tendencies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415202,"Understanding what leads to effective conversations can aid the design of better computer-mediated communication platforms. In particular, prior observational work has sought to identify behaviors of individuals that correlate to their conversational efficiency. However, translating such correlations to causal interpretations is a necessary step in using them in a prescriptive fashion to guide better designs and policies. In this work, we formally describe the problem of drawing causal links between conversational behaviors and outcomes. We focus on the task of determining a particular type of policy for a text-based crisis counseling platform: how best to allocate counselors based on their behavioral tendencies exhibited in their past conversations. We apply arguments derived from causal inference to underline key challenges that arise in conversational settings where randomized trials are hard to implement. Finally, we show how to circumvent these inference challenges in our particular domain, and illustrate the potential benefits of an allocation policy informed by the resulting prescriptive information. In this work, we considered the problem of translating observed relationships between conversational behaviors and outcomes into actionable insights. Through examining a particular policyâ allocating agents in conversational platformsâthat such observational analyses could inform, we formally described the inference task and inherent challenges involved, translating causal inference arguments to the domain of conversations. In the context of crisis counseling, we demonstrated the importance of properly addressing these challenges, but also the potential benefits of policies that are informed by careful analyses of conversations. Here, we describe how our particular work informs broader studies of computer-mediated settings where conversations play a central role. We also highlight some empirical and theoretical limitations that future work could take up. The bulk of our work examines one type of conversational settingâgoal-oriented asymmetric conversation platformsâand one type of policyâallocating agents. This focus enables us to develop theoretical descriptions that clearly highlight key aspects of the inference taskâthe relationships between behavior, circumstance, and outcome; it is also grounded in a socially consequential realworld setting, crisis counseling. We note, however, that this inference task is relevant to a broader range of conversational settings: like team discussions or public forms, where conversational roles may be more fluid and extend beyond that of agent and client, while different participants may have different goals in the conversation. A platform could also pursue a range of other policies, such as training effective conversational behaviors or deterring detrimental ones via practices like moderation. These related settings and policies inherit the challenges we have described: the underlying problems of causally relating behaviors and outcomes, and of addressing the inference challenges from assignment and interaction, continue to be salient beyond our particular focus. We see our work as critically examining one important part of developing policies to improve conversational platforms: translating descriptive findings based on observational data into prescriptive information. Designing and implementing these policies requires a wealth of additional research. For instance, other studies could examine more intricate conversational behaviors and tendencies, viewing the rich types of characteristics explored in many past descriptive studies through a causal lens. A more nuanced understanding of conversational outcomes is needed to gauge the effectiveness of any policy. For example, in this setting, a complementary line of work could develop more informative ways to elicit texter feedback, seeking to better understand and mitigate the presently low response rate; understanding longer-term impacts of a counseling conversation would also be valuable. Numerous factors relating to the implementation of a policy would need to be accounted for as well; as noted earlier, the estimated benefits of allocating more conversations to counselors must be weighed against the potential for the additional workload to strain the counselorsâ mental health and conversational effectiveness. Addressing these aspects is beyond the scope of our work, and we look to other studies of computer-mediated communication platforms for promising approaches [30, 32]. However, we emphasize that the core problem of measuring the causal effects of a policy is salient regardless of the extent to which other components of the policy are well-developedâsuch that identifying these effects, while not sufficient, is necessary in informing these policies."
CrowdCO-OP: Sharing Risks and Rewards in Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415203,"Paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate Artificial Intelligence systems. Modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. Such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. As a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. In this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. Reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex HITs without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. We experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. Our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches. In this paper, we have proposed and experimentally evaluated novel crowdsourcing risk and reward sharing schemes that enable crowd workers to move away from piecework payments and allow them to focus on performing crowd work with less stress and less time pressure. Our method also encourages workers to try diverse tasks. Even reward-motivated workers can take up challenging and complex HITs without worrying about missing financial rewards. To this end, we built a new crowdsourcing platform, CrowdCO-OP, by leveraging the API provided by MTurk, that allows us to perform controlled experiments comparing different reward distribution mechanisms and task information. Our findings show that co-op reward sharing creates a win-win situation for both workers and requesters: For workers, unrewarded activities are shared thus allowing for risk mitigation; For requesters, our alternative reward mechanisms lead to a more productive workforce and do not lead to lower quality data."
On the Misinformation Beat: Understanding the Work of Investigative Journalists Reporting on Problematic Information Online,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415204,"Journalists are increasingly investigating and reporting on problematic online content such as misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories, leading to the creation of a new misinformation beat. The process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on this kind of data is complex and nuanced. It is especially challenging as online actors attempt to undermine their work. Through in-depth interviews with twelve journalists, we explore how they investigate and report on online misinformation and disinformation. Our findings reveal some of the unique challenges of reporting on this beat, as well as the ways in which reporters overcome those challenges. We highlight and discuss how journalistic values could be better embedded into the design of tools to support their work, the power dynamics between social media companies and journalists, and the promise of collaborations as a way to support and educate journalists on this beat. This work provides contextual knowledge to researchers looking to better support investigative journalists - on the misinformation beat and beyond - as their work becomes more entangled in sociotechnical systems. Online platforms have become increasingly salient in breaking news events, culture, and politics. Consequently, journalists are looking to these spaces for stories and investigations. This research provides a window into the practices of journalists who are investigating their stories on and through social media. In particular, we focus on journalists working an emergent new beat of online misand disinformation. We find that journalists overcome the unique technical, methodological, ethical challenges of this work by embedding themselves in online communities, working with experts, and improving their own data skills. Situating the findings within literature about changing journalism practices, computational tools designed to support modern journalists, and the complexities of online disinformation, we contribute insight into how to better support these kinds of journalists in the future. We suggest that designers of data tools for journalists pay special attention to the traditional values held by those in the journalism field. We discuss the power dynamics that exist between journalists and platforms, and we suggest that future work involves studying the informal collaborations between journalists and researchers that are already taking place. We foresee this ""beat"" will grow to include more journalists, including those looking specifically at online mis- and disinformation as well as adjacent topics such as bullying, harassment, and radicalization, and we see supporting these emerging experts as an opportunity for future CSCW research."
Food Aid Technology: The Experience of a Syrian Refugee Community in Coping with Food Insecurity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415205,"Over half of Syrian refugee households in Lebanon are food insecure with some reliant on an electronic voucher (e-voucher) system for food aid. The interplay between the digitisation of food aid, within the socio-technical context of refugees, and community collaborative practices is yet to be investigated. Through design engagements and interviews with refugees and shop owners we explore the experiences of a Syrian refugee community in Lebanon using the e-voucher system. We provide insights into the socio-technical environment in which the e-voucher system is dispensing aid, the information and power asymmetries experienced, refugee collaborative coping practices and how they interplay with the e-voucher system. We highlight the need for: (1) expanding refugee digital capabilities to encompass understandings of aid technologies and identifying trusted intermediaries and (2) for technologies to support in upholding humanitarian principles and mitigating power and information asymmetries. Lastly, we call for CSCW researchers and humanitarian innovators to consider how humanitarian technologies can enable refugee collaborative practices and adopt everyday security as a lens for designing aid technologies. The paper contributes to CSCW knowledge regarding the interplay between aid technologies and refugees? socio-technical contexts and practices that provides a basis for future technological designs for collaborative technologies for refugee food security. Through investigating a refugee communityâs experience of coping with food insecurity while engaging with a technological food aid system, we identified how the digitisation of aid shifted the responsibility of dispensing aid from NGO organisations to shop owners, in turn introducing issues of technological literacy; as well as power and information asymmetries. Furthermore, we show how refugee participants have developed collaborative practices including collective purchasing. When further investigating the feasibility of collective purchasing, participants highlighted the added value further leveraging this collaborative practice has in coping with food insecurity. However, the current food aid technology does not lend itself to such forms of collaborative action. Research within the field of food security has shown that unrestricted cash assistance is as effective as the e-voucher system in supporting refugees to cope with food insecurity [5]. However, while unrestricted cash has been shown to be as positive in terms of improving food security as e-vouchers, they do not match the significant impact that e-vouchers have on improving dietary diversity [5]. Therefore, the WFP is currently trialing combination models where particularly vulnerable refugees receive e-vouchers and an unrestricted cash top-up [5]. It is within such models that we can start designing and piloting technologies for collective purchasing that may leverage the unrestricted cash available within refugee communities. However, given that the refugee community we worked with was mostly reliant on e-vouchers to purchase food we need to consider how the e-voucher system can be re-designed to account for power and information asymmetries as well as the collaborative values and practices within refugee communities."
Collecting the Public Perception of AI and Robot Rights,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415206,"Whether to give rights to artificial intelligence (AI) and robots has been a sensitive topic since the European Parliament proposed advanced robots could be granted ""electronic personalities."" Numerous scholars who favor or disfavor its feasibility have participated in the debate. This paper presents an experiment (N=1270) that 1) collects online users' first impressions of 11 possible rights that could be granted to autonomous electronic agents of the future and 2) examines whether debunking common misconceptions on the proposal modifies one's stance toward the issue. The results indicate that even though online users mainly disfavor AI and robot rights, they are supportive of protecting electronic agents from cruelty (i.e., favor the right against cruel treatment). Furthermore, people's perceptions became more positive when given information about rights-bearing non-human entities or myth-refuting statements. The style used to introduce AI and robot rights significantly affected how the participants perceived the proposal, similar to the way metaphors function in creating laws. For robustness, we repeated the experiment over a more representative sample of U.S. residents (N=164) and found that perceptions gathered from online users and those by the general population are similar. This study collected online usersâ perception of 11 possible rights for highly advanced and autonomous AI and robots of the future. We tested flexibility in peopleâs responses by exposing them to four kinds of carefully designed interventions. Our study shows that online users, at first, disfavor rights to electronic agents. Those rights most relevant in the context of legal systems and life â i.e., the right to sue and be sued, the right to hold assets, the right to enter contracts, and the right to life â faced the highest rejection amongst all. The only exception was the right against cruel treatment and punishment. The experiment also showed whether and how online usersâ perceptions can be modified. Respondents took more positive views after being exposed to interventions that corrected misinformation on legal personhood. This change was statistically significant. Listing examples of rights-bearing non-human entities (i.e., non-human design) and explicitly explaining that humanity is not a requirement to hold rights (i.e., descriptive design) were the two most effective. On the other hand, discussing the lack of agreement among scholars on the requirements for legal personhood (i.e., normative design) and listing examples of human entities who were socially neglected in the past (i.e., human design) did not, in many cases, result in a significant stance-change. Phrasing style was an essential factor that affected how people responded to our survey. For most of the proposed rights, indirectly introducing the proposal elicited more support. We posit that an allusive discussion style may create a sense that, rather than a right is granted to an electronic entity, a new duty is created for existing legal persons. In some scenarios, however, explicit phrasing elicited more support. We hypothesize that the concept of ârightsâ depends on its context and how it is posed. This finding is in accord with the argument that the regulation of AI will depend on which metaphors are used during the process [43]. Likewise, the metaphors on how the rights were phrased affected peopleâs judgment of AI and robot rights. Explicitly reminding people that the target electronic agents are completely autonomous was also critical in bringing more support; the stance towards most rights became more positive under this writing style. Finally, we discuss a possible subject-expectancy effect in the survey results, a form of bias that might arise due to the reactivity of research subjects in the experiment. Since the participants were presented with similar survey questions before and after the intervention, they may have been motivated to change their responses regardless of the intervention message. However, we consider this bias would be minimal for two reasons. First, the intervention was not instantaneous and took on average 97.5 seconds (see Appendix B). This indicates that participants spent enough time reading and digesting the content. Second, the stance-change was not random but consistently positive after the intervention. Had any subject-expectancy effect been in play, the stance-change direction would not be consistent across all rights. Our research does not, by any means, propose AI and robots be treated as humans, or as other non-natural legal persons. Electronic agents are a new type of entity that must be regulated from the start while taking past experiences with diverse bodies and technologies. Our survey results resonate with the argument that regulations should not necessarily consider AI and robots as âhumans,â but one must acknowledge that people might treat them as so [43]. Granting legal personhood to electronic agents is a contested possibility, and our results indicate that people are somewhat flexible and supportive of specific rights for AI and robots. When considered along with the previous progression of rights for animals and corporations (i.e., nonhuman entities), our results suggest that social norms could take one day shift in favor of granting fully autonomous AI and robots some rights (at least one or several) discussed in this paper. Furthermore, given the controversial aspect of the proposal and historical precedents (e.g., rights of women and slaves), which have shown that granting rights to previously neglected entities is a slow process, our finding supports the argument that public opinion might change in the future. Considering that our intervention was simple, real-life exposures to various other interventions may lead to a more considerable stance change. In conclusion, debunking common misconceptions regarding rights and duties to non-natural entities have shown to be successful in modifying peopleâs stance towards the possibility of granting rights to AI and robots. Our results also indicate that some rights to electronic agents might be supported by the general public soon such as, for instance, the right against cruelty and copyright. We hope this research promotes a more inclusive discussion of a prominent, yet controversial issue involving the rapid deployment of AI and robots in society. Granting rights to non-humans (and even some groups of humans) has always faced prejudice and rejections at first thought, but doing so has become an essential social and political aspect of contemporary society [48]."
Effects of Shared Gaze on Audio- Versus Text-Based Remote Collaborations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415207,"Remote collaborations are becoming ubiquitous, but, despite their many advantages, face unique challenges compared to collocated collaborations. Visualizing the collaborator's point of gaze on a shared screen has been explored as a promising way to alleviate some of these limitations by increasing shared awareness. However, prior studies on shared gaze have not considered the medium of communication and have only studied its effect on audio. This paper presents a study that compares the effects of shared gaze on collaboration performance during audio- and text-based communication. We find that for text, shared gaze improved task correctness and led collaborators to look at and talk more about shared content. Similar trends are found for gaze-augmented voice communication, but contrary to the slower performance in text, it also saw improvements in completion time as well as in cognitive workload. Our findings demonstrate the differences in how shared gaze impacts audio- versus text-based communication and highlight the need to further understand the nuances of the medium of communication when designing novel tools to support remote collaborators. In this paper, we studied the effect of shared gaze on remote collaborations in which text-based communication was examined for the first time. We conducted a within-subjects study with 24 pairs that collaborated over voice- and text-based media with and without the presence of a real-time shared gaze visualization. This work presents novel findings on the effect of gaze on text-based communication. Adding the real-time visualization of the partnerâs gaze to chat improved collaboration in terms of task correctness and led participants to talk about and look more often at shared content. In addition, collaborators reported higher levels of awareness of their partnerâs activity, as well as increased perceived performance, joint attention, and smooth flow of communication. However, shared gaze negatively impacted the effort and mental demand required from participants, who overall preferred gaze-augmented voice-based communication. Contrary to text-based communication, collaboration over audio additionally benefited from shared gaze through reductions in completion time and cognitive workload. The comparison of results between gaze-augmented voice and text demonstrate that in text-based collaboration processes, shared gaze led to qualitative changes, rather than simply facilitating it. Our study highlights the differences in how shared gaze impacts audio- versus text-based communication. While the results for voice mostly agree with prior literature, our novel findings demonstrate the potential benefits of real-time shared gaze visualization to text-based collaborations. Although chat as a baseline medium could be seen as inferior to voice due to its inherently lower transmission velocity, the notable improvements in several objective and subjective measures show that further research is warranted to better understand the nuances of shared gaze in the context of text-based communication. Thus, we believe this work presents a first step towards adding shared gaze as a feature to novel settings. In addition to implications for accessibility and recreational settings, our findings on gaze-augmented text communication are relevant for larger teams. The lack of familiarity between participants, the type of the task, and the time pressure during the experiment could all be factors that made participants favor higher-synchronicity, voice-based media. This shows that user satisfaction needs to be further investigated to match the objective improvements brought by shared gaze to text-based communication. Ultimately, developers of novel gaze-sharing tools and interaction techniques should take into account the capabilities of the communication medium to better support remote collaborators."
Supporting Women in Online Dating with a Messaging Interface that Improves their Face-to-Face Meeting Decisions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415208,"This paper presents a study of a messaging interface prototype for online dating intended to improve women's face-to-face meeting decisions, and therefore the capacity to manage the gendered risks involved with such meetings. The interface prompts users with discussion topics that are potentially more valuable for user evaluation than the impression management-motivated topics often chosen by men. These topics come in the form of first-date scenarios that messaging partners either agree or disagree on. Through a mixed-methods study utilizing speed dating events, daters used the interface to interact before meeting face-to-face. Results indicate that women's face-to-face meeting decisions improve when the interface prompts them to discuss scenarios involving agreement of opinion. Men's decisions are worsened by the same interface variant, potentially due to the displayed agreement being misinterpreted as a signal of compatibility. The study ultimately stresses that designs intended for women, and at-risk groups more broadly, must also be assessed with other user demographics-namely those that pose a risk-to identify unforeseen implications. In this paper we presented the prompted discussion interface; a messaging interface for online dating systems intended to help women inform their face-to-face meeting decisions and therefore better manage the gendered risks of meeting new dating partners. The interface prompts users to discuss their pre-selected opinions about a first-date conflict scenario (e.g., a woman realizes her date lied about his real height in his profile; should she stop dating him?). Results from a mixed methods study indicate that the variant of the interface that prompts users to discuss an agreement of opinion did improve womenâs face-to-face meeting decisions, yet menâs decisions were worsened by the same interface variant, potentially due to a misinterpretation of a visualized agreement as a signal of compatibility. So while risks to women in regards to poorly informed face-to-face meeting decisions seemed to be mitigated, the interface inadvertently introduced a new risk by way of potentially misleading men about attraction or compatibility due to their misunderstanding of interface content. The results ultimately stress the importance of including user demographics that pose risk into research and design of interfaces for risk mitigation in order to identify unanticipated implications."
"""Am I doing this all wrong?"": Challenges and Opportunities in Family Information Management",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415209,"Running a household requires a large amount of labor, from ensuring multiple bills are paid to organizing important documents. Failure to manage such information can have critical consequences for the financial and psychological well-being of the family; however, little is known about how families manage the full scale of information encountered in the home. In this paper, we introduce family information management (FIM) as a set of overarching practices involved in managing and coordinating household-related information. To understand how families engage in FIM, we conducted in-depth interviews with members of ten families, which included guided tours of their information archives. We found that families struggle to organize, store, retrieve, and share information, and that there are significant socioemotional costs to this work. We propose opportunities for designing technologies to support FIM and argue that, given the numerous challenges and unmet needs, the understudied area of FIM deserves further investment of research and design efforts. In this study, we introduced the term family information management (FIM) to characterize a set of practices involved in managing the information needs in households, which we see as distinct from PIM and GIM. We identifed how families triage, store, retrieve, and share household-related information, the challenges they face in doing so, and the socioemotional factors associated with such information management. Based on our fndings, we put forth guidance for technologies targeted at the FIM space. Our study shows that FIM is a challenging but necessary part of everyday life, underserved by current technologies, and understudied in the HCI literature. Research in this area can make meaningful improvements to the well-being of individuals and families, and we are hopeful that this work will fuel further interest and research into FIM."
Implicit Diversity in Image Summarization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415210,"Studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. This skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. For example, Kay et al. showed that although 28% of CEOs in the U.S. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for ""CEO"" in Google Image Search are women. Similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. Most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. These labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. However, such labels are often unknown. Further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. As observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. We develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. The goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. It accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this ""diversity score"" into the final selection process. Importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. We provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known MMR algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. We evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 Google Image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known CelebA dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as ""smiling"" or ""glasses"". Both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current Google Image Search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. Further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. These empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search. The approaches presented in this paper (QS-balanced and MMR-balanced) aim to ensure fairness in summarization algorithms in the absence of (explicitly or inferred) labelled data in either training or deployment in order to decrease bias. As a post-processing approach, it is also flexible in that it can be applied post-hoc to an existing system where the only additional input necessary is a small set of âdiverseâ images. We show its efficacy on two datasets: an image dataset of occupations where it can significantly improve the diversity of the images selected with little cost to accuracy as compared to images selected by Google and an image dataset of celebrities where it can selects significantly more diverse images for gender-neutral facial attributes. Due to the generality and simplicity of the approach, we expect our algorithm to perform well for a variety of domains, and it would be interesting to see to what extent it can be applied in areas beyond image summarization."
Countering Fake News: A Comparison of Possible Solutions Regarding User Acceptance and Effectiveness,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415211,"Since the emergence of so-called fake news on the internet and in social media, platforms such as Facebook have started to take countermeasures, and researchers have begun looking into this phenomenon from a variety of perspectives. A large number of scientific work has investigated ways to detect fake news automatically. Less attention has been paid to the subsequent step, i.e., what to do when you are aware of the inaccuracy of claims in social media. This work takes a user-centered approach on means to counter identified mis- and disinformation in social media. We conduct a three-step study design on how approaches in social media should be presented to respect the users' needs and experiences and how effective they are. As our first step, in an online survey representative for some factors to the German adult population, we enquire regarding their strategies on handling information in social media, and their opinion regarding possible solutions --- focusing on the approach of displaying a warning on inaccurate posts. In a second step, we present five potential approaches for countermeasures identified in related work to interviewees for qualitative input. We discuss (1) warning, (2) related articles, (3) reducing the size, (4) covering, and (5) requiring confirmation. Based on the interview feedback, as the third step of this study, we select, improve, and examine four promising approaches on how to counter misinformation. We conduct an online experiment to test their effectiveness on the perceived accuracy of false headlines and also ask for the users' preferences. In this study, we find that users welcome warning-based approaches to counter fake news and are somewhat critical with less transparent methods. Moreover, users want social media platforms to explain why a post was marked as disputed. The results regarding effectiveness are similar: Warning-based approaches are shown to be effective in reducing the perceived accuracy of false headlines. Moreover, adding an explanation to the warning leads to the most significant results. In contrast, we could not find a significant effect on one of Facebook's current approaches (reduced post size and fact-checks in related articles). In this work, we examined and compared measures to counter fake news in social media. Using a three-step study design, we took a closer look at their effectiveness and the user perspective. In summary, we found high acceptance of a warning approach, especially when combined with an explanation. Warning-based approaches were also effective in reducing the estimated accuracy of false news headlines. Our work provides relevant insights into the field of CSCW and social computing and in particular to the question of a collaborative character of fake news. It is one thing to detect fake news content quickly and reliably, but the question remains what to do with such posts. Social media platforms like Facebook have started to develop and deploy strategies for that. With this work, we contribute to a better understanding of those approaches that can help to improve existing efforts."
"'Yes, I comply!': Motivations and Practices around Research Data Management and Reuse across Scientific Fields",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415212,"As science becomes increasingly data-intensive, the requirements for comprehensive Research Data Management (RDM) grow. This often overwhelms scientists, requiring more workload and training. The failure to conduct effective RDM leads to producing research artefacts that cannot be reproduced or reused. Past research placed high value on supporting data science workers, but focused mainly on data production, collection, processing, and sensemaking. In order to understand practices and needs of data science workers in relation to documentation, preservation, sharing, and reuse, we conducted a cross-domain study with 15 scientists and data managers from diverse scientific domains. We identified five core concepts which describe requirements, drivers, and boundaries in the development of commitment for RDM, essential for generating reproducible research artefacts: Practice, Adoption, Barriers, Education, and Impact. Based on those concepts, we introduce a stage-based model of personal RDM commitment evolution. The model can be used to drive the design of future systems that support a transition to open science. We discuss infrastructure, policies, and motivations involved at the stages and transitions in the model. Our work supports designers in understanding the constraints and challenges involved in designing for reproducibility in an age of data-driven science. This paper presented a systematic study of motivations and practices around research data management (RDM) and reuse across a wide variety of scientific domains. We extended work on barriers involved in RDM and collaboration in science to systematically map factors that contribute to motivation and impact researchersâ commitment towards RDM. We investigated how the design of emerging infrastructure shapes motivation and commitment towards RDM. The findings from our interview study with 15 researchers and research data managers highlighted the delicate balance between researchersâ frustration about bad data practices, lack of knowledge and ambiguity in RDM practices, and hesitation to commit to comprehensive RDM. Based on our data analysis, we mapped practices around RDM and reuse across multiple scientific domains and described five core concepts: Practice, Education, Adoption, Barriers, and Impact. Based on those, we presented the Stage-Based Model of Personal RDM Commitment Evolution. We discussed drivers and inhibitors in the transition between the four stages of the model (Non-Reproducible Practices, Overcoming Barriers, Sustained Commitment, and Reward) and identified infrastructure and design components that provide accessible starting points for scholars and practitioners who want to contribute to better RDM systems. In particular, our work shows that a mix of different types of motivation and regulatory styles play a role at various stages in the RDM life cycle. We advocate for future field-specific investigations and the development of standardized instruments to map differences and commonalities of commitment drivers in the transition between the four stages. We hope that our research will stimulate further development of tools and systems that support the transition to open science."
Mobile Collocated Gaming: Collaborative Play and Meaning-Making on a University Campus,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415213,"Many mobile games are designed to be placeless, so that mobile device owners could play anytime, anywhere. But does such design erase the sense of place in mobile gaming? To investigate the spatiality of mobile gaming, we conducted an ethnographic study of mobile gaming in a Chinese university. We found mobile gaming as a form of collocated interaction, where participants collectively created meanings around distinctive places on the campus including dormitory, classroom, and laboratory, and engaged in collaborative play. Their mobile collocated gaming was shaped by the social, organizational, and cultural contexts of places. The spatiality of mobile collocated gaming entails both appropriation of the norms and expectations of places and creation of new meanings to negotiate tensions between mobile gaming and places. We further discuss the spatiality of mobile collocated gaming and broader social and cultural conditions. In this paper, we discussed the spatiality of mobile gaming in China, reporting on the distinctive characteristics of mobile gaming on a university campus. Even for placeless-by-design mobile technologies, place is still meaningful for scrutinizing the intersection between play and infrastructure, clashes of individual and institutional values, and sites of negotiation, interpretation, and appropriation. Much more future work could be done in this area, focusing on the enactment, transformation, and maintenance of places, and particularly their complex interactions with mobile technologies."
Are You One of Us?: Current Hiring Practices Suggest the Potential for Class Biases in Large Tech Companies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415214,"To better understand how we can broaden participation in computing, this exploratory study examines the interview process for elite internships at established technology companies. Through conducting 36 interviews with evaluators at technology companies, we find that in addition to technical competence, evaluators often assess internship applicants based on explicit and implicit signals of industrial fit, organizational fit, and individual fit. These evaluative criteria are reminiscent of prior literature linking biases in hiring to social class background. By reflecting on how our findings relate to previous studies, we suggest that evaluators? assessments of fit are potentially linked to social class background, and this might be an invisible factor contributing to hiring biases at technology companies. Given that hiring only culturally similar employees can have negative individual, organizational, and societal consequences, we propose strategies for evaluators to broaden their evaluation perspectives and to enact inclusive interviewing practices. We conclude with a call for further research on the role of social class background in the hiring process. By studying how evaluators at technology companies assess applicants, this exploratory study investigates the hidden factors that shape evaluatorsâ assessments of interviewee applicants for elite internships. Findings suggest that evaluators select candidates who signal three kinds of âfitâ with the organization: applicants who display industrial fit by communicating and producing written materials in ways that align with the goals and values of the technology industry; applicants with internal referrals or social connections who will vouch for their organizational fit; and applicants who demonstrate individual fit with specific evaluators through an alignment of appearance, tastes, and reported leisure pursuits. Drawing on literature on hiring and social class background, our research suggests the potentially critical role that social class background can play in the interview process of technology companies. As such, we call for HCI and CSCW communities to directly examine the relationships between social class background and hiring and to find ways to minimize the potential for systemic bias in hiring."
A Framework for Understanding the Relationship between Social Media Discourse and Mental Health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415215,"Over 35% of the world's population uses social media. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have radically influenced the way individuals interact and communicate. These platforms facilitate both public and private communication with strangers and friends alike, providing rich insight into an individual's personality, health, and wellbeing. To date, many researchers have employed a variety of methods for extracting mental health-centric features from digital text communication (DTC) data, including natural language processing, social network analysis, and extraction of temporal discourse patterns. However, none have explored a hierarchical framework for extracting features from private messages with the goal of unifying approaches across methodological domains. Furthermore, while analyses of large, public corpora abound in existing literature, limited work has been done to explore the relationship between of private textual communications, personality traits, and symptoms of mental illness. We present a framework for constructing rich feature spaces from digital text communications. We then demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by applying it to a dataset of private Facebook messages in a college student population (N=103). Our results reveal key individual differences in temporal and relational behaviors, as well as language usage in relation to validated measures of trait-level anxiety, loneliness, and personality. This work represents a critical step forward in linking features of private social media messages to validated measures of mental health, wellbeing, and personality. Analysis of digital text communications (DTCs) remains an open research area at the intersection of mental health and computing. DTCs are feature-rich characterizations of social context, yet remain largely underexplored in existing mobile sensing frameworks. In this paper, we have proposed the SocialText framework, which defines a hierarchical structure for holistically extracting features from DTC datasets. Features pertaining to the semantics and lexicon of message content can characterize conversational context, while temporal and topological features can reveal social network ties and temporal messaging patterns. Considering all message features in combination provides a comprehensive characterization of the effect of social dynamics of DTCs on participantsâ mental states and allows researchers to leverage DTC feature extraction methodologies across academic disciplines. Our results corroborate previously established results and reveal novel individual differences in temporal and relational behaviors, as well as in vocabulary usage and topics of discussion, on Facebook Messenger. This work provides a novel path forward for future analysis and discussion of the role of DTCs in personality, mental health, and wellbeing online."
What Happens to All These Hackathon Projects?: Identifying Factors to Promote Hackathon Project Continuation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415216,"Time-based events, such as hackathons and codefests, have become a global phenomenon attracting thousands of participants to hundreds of events every year. While research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. While case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. Our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. Our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. While short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. Moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation. This paper contributes to our understanding of short- and long-term technical continuation behavior after a time-based social computing event by reporting on findings from a large-scale study of the hackathon database Devpost. Studying project continuation related to a theoretically founded selection of potential antecedents of continuation behavior we established that short- and longterm project continuation behavior are different phenomena. We found short-term continuation behavior to be associated with technical preparation activities prior to a hackathon, the number of technologies a team uses to create a project and winning one of the few prizes at a large event, while long-term continuation was conversely related to skill diversity and skill matching among team members and their intention to expand their projectâs reach. Moreover, we also found that intensive short-term activity can be detrimental to long-term continuation. These insights provide hints for organizers and participants of time-based social computing events on how to prepare, conduct and follow up on an event to be positively associated with project continuation after it has ended. In the future we are planning to conduct additional qualitative studies to assess the potential impact of participant and organizers motivations and expectations on continuation behavior and to explore continuation activities beyond technical contributions to the same repository that teams used during an event."
Designing Digital Safe Spaces for Peer Support and Connectivity in Patriarchal Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415217,"This paper explores the opportunities and challenges in designing peer-support mechanisms for low-income,low-literate women in Pakistan, a patriarchal and religious context where women's movements, social relationsand access to digital technologies are restricted. Through a qualitative, empirical study with 21 participantswe examine the cultural and patriarchal framework where shame and fear of defamation restrict the seekingof support for personal narratives around taboo subjects like abortion, sexual harassment, rape and domesticabuse. Based on our qualitative data we also conduct a second qualitative study using a technology probe with15 low-income, low-literate women to explore the specific design of peer-support technologies for supportseeking and the sharing of sensitive and taboo narratives in a deeply patriarchal society. The design concernsraised by our participants regarding privacy, anonymity and safety provide CSCW researchers with valuableguidelines about designing for social connections and support for vulnerable populations within a particularcontext. This paper unpacks opportunities and challenges for designing technologies that support womenâs mental health seeking behaviors in low-literate populations in Pakistan. Our field study reveals systemic challenges women face while discussing and seeking support for deeply traumatic narratives considered taboo in Pakistani society. We expand existing CSCW knowledge on designing within a patriarchy to include âconnectednessâ and present specific and tested design guidelines for privacy, anonymity and safety in designing for connectedness."
Intersectional AI: A Study of How Information Science Students Think about Ethics and Their Impact,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415218,"Recent literature has demonstrated the limited and, in some instances, waning role of ethical training in computing classes in the US. The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to be inequitable or harmful is well documented, yet it's an issue that continues to lack apparent urgency or effective mitigation. The question we raise in this paper is how to prepare future generations to recognize and grapple with the ethical concerns of a range of issues plaguing AI, particularly when they are combined with surveillance technologies in ways that have grave implications for social participation and restriction?from risk assessment and bail assignment in criminal justice, to public benefits distribution and access to housing and other critical resources that enable security and success within society. The US is a mecca of information and computer science (IS and CS) learning for Asian students whose experiences as minorities renders them familiar with, and vulnerable to, the societal bias that feeds AI bias. Our goal was to better understand how students who are being educated to design AI systems think about these issues, and in particular, their sensitivity to intersectional considerations that heighten risk for vulnerable groups. In this paper we report on findings from qualitative interviews with 20 graduate students, 11 from an AI class and 9 from a Data Mining class. We find that students are not predisposed to think deeply about the implications of AI design for the privacy and well-being of others unless explicitly encouraged to do so. When they do, their thinking is focused through the lens of personal identity and experience, but their reflections tend to center on bias, an intrinsic feature of design, rather than on fairness, an outcome that requires them to imagine the consequences of AI. While they are, in fact, equipped to think about fairness when prompted by discussion and by design exercises that explicitly invite consideration of intersectionality and structural inequalities, many need help to do this empathy 'work.' Notably, the students who more frequently reflect on intersectional problems related to bias and fairness are also more likely to consider the connection between model attributes and bias, and the interaction with context. Our findings suggest that experience with identity-based vulnerability promotes more analytically complex thinking about AI, lending further support to the argument that identity-related ethics should be integrated into IS and CS curriculums, rather than positioned as a stand-alone course. Information Science graduate student display varying degrees of sensitivity to the way in which their identities interact with power structures to limit their opportunities. The more readily students make these connections, the more they worry about AI fairness, which in turn, makes them more interested in hearing from the people at risk than expert observers or intermediaries. This empathy âworkâ does not come easily. Students are willing to take on responsibility for the thought process around fairness, but they find it difficult to do and sometimes they need help. We have provided justification and also guidance for a pedagogical approach to empathetic and responsible AI learning. This includes recommendations to prompt imaginative discussions, using an intersectional lens as well as suggested methods for extrapolation through engagement. Our study is inspired by a sense of urgency about the way that AI are being used to shape every aspect of our lives with little consideration for the impacts to society. We are concerned about the hazards of an environment that apologizes later, and how those norms impact AI design. We will use our findings to share future research about how best to prepare students to enter AI with a sense of empathy and concern for the most vulnerable, intersectional identities among us. Future research might study the impact of âliveâ case studies in the classroom with vulnerable individuals and its impact on the way that students design. We will be looking for ways to integrate intersectional thinking about AI into the curriculum and to study its impact on ethics throughout of students AI training. Our work contributes novel insights about intersectional thinking in the context of AI bias and fairness. It provides guidance to scholars about how to build on these findings for pedagogy with integrative learning approaches. However, our study is limited by a small sample size of students who do not represent the full range of developers. Additionally, we encountered language constraints that may have limited the full articulation of their point of view and which also made it difficult for us to share our findings."
ORES: Lowering Barriers with Participatory Machine Learning in Wikipedia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415219,"Algorithmic systems---from rule-based bots to machine learning classifiers---have a long history of supporting the essential work of content moderation and other curation work in peer production projects. From counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like Wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency. However, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. In this paper, we describe ORES: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ORES decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. This meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithms in Wikipedia to a broader set of participants. In this paper, we discuss the theoretical mechanisms of social change ORES enables and detail case studies in participatory machine learning around ORES from the 5 years since its deployment. In this âsocio-technical systems paper,â we first discussed ORES as a technical system: an open API for providing access to machine learning models for Wikipedians. We then discussed the socio-technical system we have developed around ORES that allows us to encode communities emic concepts in their models, collaboratively and iteratively audit their performance, and support broad appropriation of the models both within Wikipediaâs editing community and in the broader research community. We have also shown a series of demonstrative cases how these concepts are negotiated, audits are performed, and appropriation has taken place. This system, the observations, and the cases show a deep view of a technical system and the social structures around it. In particular, we analyze this arrangement as a more decoupled approach to machine learning in organizations, which we see as a more CSCW-inspired approach to many issues being raised around the fairness, accountability, and transparency of machine learning."
Vision Skills Needed to Answer Visual Questions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415220,"The task of answering questions about images has garnered attention as a practical service for assisting populations with visual impairments as well as a visual Turing test for the artificial intelligence community. Our first aim is to identify the common vision skills needed for both scenarios. To do so, we analyze the need for four vision skills--object recognition, text recognition, color recognition, and counting--on over 27,000 visual questions from two datasets representing both scenarios. We next quantify the difficulty of these skills for both humans and computers on both datasets. Finally, we propose a novel task of predicting what vision skills are needed to answer a question about an image. Our results reveal (mis)matches between aims of real users of such services and the focus of the AI community. We conclude with a discussion about future directions for addressing the visual question answering task. Our analysis reveals the unique information needs and challenges faced by real blind users of VQA services as well as the AI community in developing VQA algorithms, while also revealing the (mis)matches of the interests for these two use cases. Our indings highlight the diiculty of generating answers for visual questions that belong to the diferent skills. Finally, our indings demonstrate the potential of designing algorithms to automatically identify directly from a given visual question which vision skills are needed to return an answer. The datasets and code are publicly shared at https://vizwiz.org to facilitate extensions of this work."

Urban Accessibility as a Socio-Political Problem: A Multi-Stakeholder Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432908,"Traditionally, urban accessibility is defined as the ease of reaching destinations. Studies on urban accessibility for pedestrians with mobility disabilities (e.g., wheelchair users) have primarily focused on understanding the challenges that the built environment imposes and how they overcome them. In this paper, we move beyond physical barriers and focus on socio-political challenges in the civic ecosystem that impedes accessible infrastructure development. Using a multi-stakeholder approach, we interviewed five primary stakeholder groups (N=25): (1) people with mobility disabilities, (2) caregivers, (3) accessibility advocates, (4) department officials, and (5) policymakers. We discussed their current accessibility assessment and decision-making practices. We identified the key needs and desires of each group, how they differed, and how they interacted with each other in the civic ecosystem to bring about change. We found that people, politics, and money were intrinsically tied to underfunded accessibility improvement projects ""without continued support from the public and the political leadership, existing funding may also disappear. Using the insights from these interviews, we explore how may technology enhance our stakeholders"" decision-making processes and facilitate accessible infrastructure development. In this work, we investigated urban accessibility as a socio-political problem by studying the various assessment, decision-making, and citizen engagement practices. Using multistakeholder analysis, this work presents an expansive view of methods and challenges in making accessibility improvements. We tease apart each stakeholderâs roles and interactions within the urban decision-making structure for accessible infrastructure development. Our study found several socio-political tensions impeding infrastructure development, including conflicting interests, unclear burden of responsibility, public disinterest, and limited funding. To facilitate accessibility efforts in this socio-political context, we identified six points of civic interactions and proposed directions for future technologies to utilize complementary data- and citizen-driven approaches, while acknowledging that technology is a facilitator rather a solution to socio-political problems."
"""So-called privacy breeds evil"": Narrative Justifications for Intimate Partner Surveillance in Online Forums",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432909,"A growing body of research suggests that intimate partner abusers use digital technologies to surveil their partners, including by installing spyware apps, compromising devices and online accounts, and employing social engineering tactics. However, to date, this form of privacy violation, called intimate partner surveillance (IPS), has primarily been studied from the perspective of victim-survivors. We present a qualitative study of how potential perpetrators of IPS harness the emotive power of sharing personal narratives to validate and legitimise their abusive behaviours. We analysed 556 stories of IPS posted on publicly accessible online forums dedicated to the discussion of sexual infidelity. We found that many users share narrative posts describing IPS as they boast about their actions, advise others on how to perform IPS without detection, and seek suggestions for next steps to take. We identify a set of common thematic story structures, justifications for abuse, and outcomes within the stories that provide a window into how these individuals believe their behaviour to be justified. Using these stories, we develop a four-stage framework that captures the change in a potential perpetrator's approach to IPS. We use our findings and framework to guide a discussion of efforts to combat abuse, including how we can identify crucial moments where interventions might be safely applied to prevent or deescalate IPS. This paper presents qualitative analyses of 556 posts from three publicly-accessible infidelity support forums in which users reported narrative accounts of using IPS against their targets. We found that sexual infidelity within an intimate relationship was used as a means of excusing abusive behaviours. We identified that postersâ stories followed common narrative pathways and used a set of common actions, events, and themes that we list in this work. Within these accounts, we identified a list of 21 justifications that posters used to legitimise their control and harm of others. We supplement these findings with a conceptual framework of how posters make sense of their use of IPS over time in reporting to this community. Our findings raise interesting questions as to how this data-set could be used to inform professional approaches to perpetrators online, how we could validate our conceptual model outside of online spaces and ideas for intervening safely."
Saudi Arabian Parents' Perception of Online Marital Matchmaking Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432910,"Finding a date or a spouse online is usually considered an individualistic endeavor in Western cultures. This presents a challenge for collectivist non-Western cultures such as Saudi Arabia where choosing a spouse is viewed as a union of two families with parents of both spouses being heavily involved. Our work aims to investigate how Saudi Arabian parents view the utilization of technology by their young adults to seek potential spouses online. We report our findings of interviews conducted with 16 Saudi Arabian parents (8 fathers, 6 mothers and 1 couple). We generate qualitative themes that provide insights about how parents wanted to preserve their values, integrate technology into the traditional process and protect their young adults from potential harms. These themes lead to implications for designing suitable marital matchmaking technologies in Saudi Arabia and opportunities for future work. Our study has explored how Saudi Arabian parents perceive marital matchmaking technologies and what role they want play in them. Our interviews with 16 Saudi Arabian parents revealed that it is important to preserve Saudi Arabian values within marital matchmaking technologies, find ways for technology to coexist with the traditional marriage process and minimize potential harms through regulation. Our findings provide insights to guide the HCI community to be more culturally sensitive and inclusive, which aims to understand and account for human values in the design process. We also provide implications on how to design matchmaking technologies in this context based on preserving values, involving parents and ensuring young adults' safety. We outlined different avenues for future investigations in this context and provide our solutions. With this work, we provide a contextually grounded research study to benefit the future work of value-sensitive design in the CSCW community."
Birds of a Caste - How Caste Hierarchies Manifest in Retweet Behavior of Indian Politicians,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432911,"The Hindu caste system plays an important role in the socio-political landscape of India. In recent years, Indian politicians have moved a lot of direct communication online. Social media is now an important space for the articulation and performance of their political positions. In this paper, we study ways in which the political performance of caste relations can be captured from the online connections and messaging of parliamentarians in India. We run tests of odds ratios among the members of LokSabha (lower house) of India to find the extent to which their engagement is insular to their own caste group versus other groups. We observe that in the LokSabha network, Members of Parliament (MPs) have higher odds of getting retweeted by others whose caste is the same or closer to their own in the caste hierarchy. The findings of this research shed light on an understudied, yet critical, social relation of caste in the study of political behavior on social media. Our goal in this paper was to introduce the study of an important sociological phenomenon, caste, in the research of political behavior on Indian Twitter. We introduce the historical and modern forms of manifestation of the caste system in India, particularly in the majority Hindu community, and discuss its centrality in the political landscape of India. We highlight the lack of discussion of the âGeneral Categoryâ in studies of caste and politics in India that renders upper caste communities casteless and makes the hierarchical and interactive nature of caste relations within them invisible. By presenting a study of caste and online behavior in the MPs that focuses on characterizing Brahmins, Upper Caste-Non-Brahmins and Intermediary Castes (forward castes,) without simply focusing on Other Backward Castes, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (backward castes), we change the conversation of caste from only being about deprivation and discrimination to that of caste privilege. We observe that caste as well as party have a significant effect, in some cases, in the likelihood of getting retweeted in the MPs network. We also observe trends of homophily at the group-level (for each caste category) where the likelihood of an MP getting retweeted by Upper-Caste MPs is higher for Upper-Caste themselves. This is especially true for those similar or closer to their own caste in the hierarchy. Additionally, we observe party-level and caste-level trends of cohesion or support within castes who are fighting for recognition of rights or engaging with particular issues of concern for their caste at the local and national level. These trends imply the need for a study of caste along with other variables that are central to online political behavior like party, language, gender, etc. It shows that there is indeed a different âin-groupâ and âout-groupâ politics at play beyond that of ideological and party differences. The significance of the question we ask when compared to the United States elections would be similar to examining the social media cohesiveness and pecking order of ethnicities in the highest legislative body of the country. While it is hard so say how well these findings translate to a different setting, India is the largest democracy in the world where caste and religion remain arguably the most important issues in the electoral system. We also describe a detailed methodological approach of tackling the messiy of the nature of caste and the challenges it poses for researchers who wish to do studies of caste and social media. We highlight the challenges in collating caste information of Indian MPs in spite of the significant role caste plays in Indian politics. We urge other researchers of social computing and CSCW community who are interested in thinking about structural inequality in South Asia to work on collecting more detailed and accurate information on caste, in addition to outlining different ways of studying caste and caste dynamics online."
CommunityClick: Capturing and Reporting Community Feedback from Town Halls to Improve Inclusivity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432912,"Local governments still depend on traditional town halls for community consultation, despite problems such as a lack of inclusive participation for attendees and difficulty for civic organizers to capture attendees' feedback in reports. Building on a formative study with 66 town hall attendees and 20 organizers, we designed and developed CommunityClick, a communitysourcing system that captures attendees' feedback in an inclusive manner and enables organizers to author more comprehensive reports. During the meeting, in addition to recording meeting audio to capture vocal attendees' feedback, we modify iClickers to give voice to reticent attendees by allowing them to provide real-time feedback beyond a binary signal. This information then automatically feeds into a meeting transcript augmented with attendees' feedback and organizers' tags. The augmented transcript along with a feedback-weighted summary of the transcript generated from text analysis methods is incorporated into an interactive authoring tool for organizers to write reports. From a field experiment at a town hall meeting, we demonstrate how CommunityClick can improve inclusivity by providing multiple avenues for attendees to share opinions. Additionally, interviews with eight expert organizers demonstrate CommunityClick's utility in creating more comprehensive and accurate reports to inform critical civic decision-making. We discuss the possibility of integrating CommunityClick with town hall meetings in the future as well as expanding to other domains. In this study, we investigated the practices and issues around the inequality of opportunity in providing feedback in town halls, especially for reticent participants. To inform our work, we attended several town halls and surveyed 66 attendees and 20 organizers. Based on our findings, we designed and developed CommunityClick, where we modified iClickers as a real-time response mechanism to give voice to silent meeting attendees and reflect on their feedback by augmenting automatically generated meeting transcripts with organizersâ tags and attendeesâ feedback. We proposed a novel feedback-weighted text summarization method along with extracting the most relevant discussion topics to better capture communityâs perspectives. We also designed an interactive interface to enable multi-faceted exploration of the summary, main discussion topics, and augmented meeting-generated data to enable organizers to author more inclusive reports. We deployed CommunityClick in-the-wild to conduct a field experiment and interviewed 8 expert organizers to evaluate our system. Our evaluation demonstrated CommunityClickâs efficacy in creating a more inclusive communication channel to capture attendeesâ opinions from town halls and provide evidence of attendeesâ feedback that could help organizers to author more comprehensive and accurate reports to inform critical civic decision-making. We discussed how CommunityClick could be integrated into the current town hall ecosystem and possibly expanded to other domains."
Seeing in Context: Traditional Visual Communication Practices in Rural Bangladesh,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432913,"There is a risk that modern practices of information communication and visualization in human-computer interaction can sideline communities due to their prioritization of scientific rationality. Such ideological hegemony can complicate interactions with data and computers, especially for low-literate communities in the global south. Through a six-month long ethnographic study with Nakshi-Katha makers, Hindu Idol makers, and witchcraft practitioners, we investigated how rural practitioners use their own forms of representation and narrative in record keeping, social and religious storytelling, and information mediated decision making. We find that traditionally developed approaches towards presenting and communicating information often make use of concrete units to represent entities and connect to designers' cultural practices and the physical location. Further, we identify how medium has significant influence in meaning-making. Often these strategies and conventions are passed down through generations within the community. In this paper, we discuss how this rural tradition differs from the modern information communication practices, discussing how an understanding of traditional practices for representing information can be useful in developing more accessible, and culturally appropriate modern tools and technologies for the people of rural Bangladesh and similar communities. In this paper we explored how modern practices of information visualization in human-computer interaction risk sidelining marginalized communities due to prioritization of scientific rationality and modernity. Through a six-month long ethnographic study with Nakshi-Katha makers, Hindu Idol makers, and witchcraft practitioners, we investigated how rural practitioners use their own forms of representation and narrative in record keeping, social and religious storytelling, and information-mediated decision-making. We found that traditionally developed approaches towards presenting information often made use of concrete units to represent entities and connect to designersâ cultural practices and the physical location. Further, we identified how medium had a significant influence in individualsâ meaning-making and how strategies and conventions are passed down through generations within the community. We discussed how the rural traditions we observed differ from the modern information visualization practices, exploring how an understanding of traditional practices for representing information might be useful in developing more accessible, and culturally appropriate modern tools and technologies for the people of rural Bangladesh and similar communities. We hope that our findings might offer additional insight for researchers and practitioners investigating ways to broaden the impact of information and collaborative technologies."
Tensions between Access and Control in Makerspaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432914,"Makerspaces have complex access control requirements and are increasingly protected through digital access control mechanisms (e.g., keycards, transponders). However, it remains unclear how space administrators craft access control policies, how existing technical infrastructures support and fall short of access needs, and how these access control policies impact end-users in a makerspace. We bridge this gap through a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder study. Specifically, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with makerspace administrators across the U.S. along with a survey of 48 makerspace end-users. We found four factors influenced administrators' construction of access control policies: balancing safety versus access; logistics; prior experience; and, the politics of funding. Moreover, administrators often made situational exceptions to their policies: e.g., during demand spikes, to maintain a good relationship with their staff, and if they trusted the user(s) requesting an exception. Conversely, users expressed frustration with the static nature of access control policies, wishing for negotiability and for social nuance to be factored into access decisions. The upshot is that existing mechanisms for access control in makerspaces are often inappropriately static and socially unaware. We conducted a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder investigation into how makerspace administrators construct, refine, and make exceptions to access control policies, and how those policies impact end-user experiences. Specifically, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 16 makerspace administrators and a survey with 48 makerspace end-users. We found makerspace administrators were forced to craft and constantly refine static access control policies based on four dynamic and contextually-sensitive factors: safety, logistics, experience and funding. Owing to these dynamic inputs and static outputs, administrators often had to make exceptions to their policies to account for social considerations (e.g., their trust in certain end-users and their desire to maintain a good working relationship with staff). We also found end-users expressed frustration with the static and binary nature of existing access control mechanisms in makerspaces, yearning for systems more socially and contextually aware. Finally, we proposed a number of design opportunities for the development of novel access control systems for shared physical spaces."
"""It's all about conversation"": Challenges and Concerns of Faculty and Students in the Arts, Humanities, and the Social Sciences about Education at Scale",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432915,"As colleges and universities continue their commitment to increasing access to higher education through offering education online and at scale, attention on teaching open-ended subjects online and at scale, mainly the arts, humanities, and the social sciences, remains limited. While existing work in scaling open-ended courses primarily focuses on the evaluation and feedback of open-ended assignments, there is a lack of understanding of how to effectively teach open-ended, university-level courses at scale. To better understand the needs of teaching large-scale, open-ended courses online effectively in a university setting, we conducted a mixed-methods study with university instructors and students, using surveys and interviews, and identified five critical pedagogical elements that distinguish the teaching and learning experiences in an open-ended course from that in a non-open-ended course. An overarching theme for the five elements was the need to support students' self-expression. We further uncovered open challenges and opportunities when incorporating the five critical pedagogical elements into large-scale, open-ended courses online in a university setting, and suggested six future research directions: (1) facilitate in-depth conversations, (2) create a studio-friendly environment, (3) adapt to open-ended assessment, (4) scale individual open-ended feedback, (5) establish trust for self-expression, and (6) personalize instruction and harness the benefits of student diversity. Our work is the first to systematically compare differences in teaching open-ended and non-openended courses in a university setting, and identify concerns that instructors and students have about scaling open-ended classes online in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences. Our mixed-methods study, incorporating surveys of instructors and students, and semi-structured instructor interviews, identifies five critical pedagogy elements that instructors valued as necessary in open-ended courses, but not as necessary or applicable for non-open-ended courses. An overarching theme for the five elements was the need to support studentsâ self-expression in open-ended courses. We further uncover the open challenges and opportunities for incorporating these pedagogical elements that support effective teaching of open-ended courses at scale and online in a university setting. Finally, we suggest six future research directions based on the open challenges and opportunities: (1) facilitate in-depth conversations, (2) create a studio-friendly environment, (3) adapt to open-ended assessment, (4) scale individual open-ended feedback, (5) establish trust for self-expression, and (6) personalize instruction and harness the benefits of student diversity. We conducted this study during AprilâDecember 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. The outbreak resulted in a forced mass migration to online pedagogy [85]. Experience with online pedagogy will likely increase after Spring 2020. We hope this work provides guidance to instructors as they migrate their university-level open-ended courses to online environments, and to those who hope to increase accessibility to higher-education via offering high-quality open-ended courses in a learning-at-scale environment in the future."
"The Situated, Relational, and Evolving Nature of Epilepsy Diagnosis",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432916,"An understanding of medical diagnosis as it is practiced is essential for those seeking to support it using intelligent systems. Through the case of epilepsy, we show that diagnosis is a situated, relational, and evolving process that accounts for information well beyond the patient's physiology, even for physiological phenomena like seizures. Through observations and interviews with neurologists, we show that the meaning of brainwaves and other physiological data depends upon a range of patient-specific and contextual factors, such as age, comorbidities, and mealtimes. Further, we show that diagnosis is partly determined by social factors such as the activities of caregivers and other clinicians, and environmental factors such as faulty electrical wiring. Additionally, diagnostic classifications can evolve in response to new information: events that were once considered seizures can be reinterpreted as clinically irrelevant and vice versa. We contribute a broader sociotechnical perspective to literature on intelligent decision making in healthcare and discuss implications for the design of decision support systems that can better support the work of medical diagnosis. How are epileptic seizures diagnosed in everyday clinical practice, and what implications might this have for decision support systems? To answer these questions, we conducted observations and interviews with neurologists in a large research and teaching hospital in the Midwestern region of the United States. We found that medical decision-making accounts for information well beyond the patientâs current physiology, even for physiological phenomena like seizures. In particular, social and contextual factorsâsuch as whether the patient is eating, where a caregiver is seated, and whether the electrical wiring is faultyâare crucial to seizure diagnosis. Further, seizures are diagnosed in relation to patient-specific, contextual, relational, and evolving understandings of normal activity and noise. Finally, diagnostic interpretations remain open to revision long past their original date of recording, and so a seizure can be reclassified as non-seizure and vice versa. Diagnostic revisions are not formally tracked and new diagnoses are implicitly understood to reshape interpretations of older data. Our findings contradict common assumptions in intelligent decision support systems, so we conclude by calling for systems that make room for expansive understandings of diagnosis as a situated, relational, and evolving process."
"""Pick Someone Who Can Kick Your Ass"" - Moneywork in Financial Third Party Access",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432917,"This paper explores some of the new possibilities for financial third party access that are enabled by ""open banking"". The term open banking is used to designate the availability of banks' customer data through application programming interfaces (APIs). Financial third party access refers to the mechanisms that facilitate the engagement of others in the management of our personal finances. Engaging trusted others in personal finances may be especially valuable for individuals experiencing financial hardship or life circumstances that place their financial stability at risk. We deployed a new third party access tool enabled by the UK Open Banking APIs for 90 days with 14 people who self-identified as living with a mental health condition. The tool, which was developed by a financial technology startup founded by the second author, allowed participants to select a trusted ""ally"" who was notified when certain transactions took place in participants' bank accounts. During the deployment, the 14 participants and 8 of their ""allies"" took part in a diary study and pre- and post-deployment interviews. The experiences of our participants reveal the inadequacy and shortcomings of existing formal third party access mechanisms, and the moneywork involved in financial third party access. We argue that focusing on this moneywork can help us design flexible, proportionate and practice-sensitive services for financial third party access that move beyond discourses of protection and control in order to enable meaningful financial collaboration. In this paper, we have explored the moneywork involved in granting others access to our finances in order to enable support with money management. We have demonstrated, through the Toucan example, how the opening up of banking data to external services can contribute to the development of new financial third party access mechanisms. We have shown the value of designing those mechanisms with a focus on moneywork, and emphasised the importance of moving beyond protection and control in order to enable meaningful financial collaboration. Financial third party access services face the difficult task of striking a balance between autonomy and protection [25]. Designers can contribute to this challenge by deploying practice-sensitive approaches that start from peopleâs situated actions."
Personalised Services in Social Situations: Principal-Agent Relationships in Account Sharing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432918,"We present a qualitative study of how personal accounts on online services, such as Tinder, Netflix and Spotify, may be shared in particular social situations. We draw from agency theory's focus on principal-agent relationships and Goffman's work on frames in analysing situations where others are allowed to use personal accounts, either for a shared purpose or on behalf of the account owner. We deploy Goffman's concepts of regrounding to understand how interests behind activities are transformed and brackets to draw attention to the boundaries of different frames, and how these are incurred or broken in situations that exceed personal account use. Based on a set of 43 written descriptions of account sharing, we depict how employing others to act as agents to use one's personal accounts may lead to playful or serious use. Additionally, we discuss consequentiality of sharing personalised services, considering both what services might reveal about the account owner and how sharing takes place in the context of relationships. We contribute by illustrating how users' relationships with personalised services are complicated by the different interests that are served when accounts are shared. We have presented a study of how personal accounts on online services â primarily Tinder, Netflix and Spotify â are shared in both co-located social situations and as a part of ongoing social relationships. Theoretically, we connect agency theory with frame analysis by incorporating Goffmanâs idea of an answer to what is going on, while also drawing attention to the question of whose or what interests are being served. Attending to principalâagent relationships, that is, the tendency and capability to take on different principals and act for their interests, complicates understandings of the mundane uses of personalised services. These services are built to serve the interests of an individual user but these account owners sometimes allow others to use the service on their behalf or use their account to serve othersâ interests. In these situations, the service may inadvertently disclose information that the account owner would prefer not to share. Moreover, acts of sharing might also have an impact on later, individual engagements with the service, depending on how effectively sharing episodes are bracketed out. Connecting to the longstanding discussion within CSCW on how the position of a user is constructed and how it matches with use-in-practice, our findings illustrate that usersâ relationships with personalised services are often complicated by the different principalâagent relationships that they are involved in."
How Developers Talk About Personal Data and What It Means for User Privacy: A Case Study of a Developer Forum on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432919,"While online developer forums are major resources of knowledge for application developers, their roles in promoting better privacy practices remain underexplored. In this paper, we conducted a qualitative analysis of a sample of 207 threads (4772 unique posts) mentioning different forms of personal data from the /r/androiddev forum on Reddit. We started with bottom-up open coding on the sampled posts to develop a typology of discussions about personal data use and conducted follow-up analyses to understand what types of posts elicited in-depth discussions on privacy issues or mentioned risky data practices. Our results show that Android developers rarely discussed privacy concerns when talking about a specific app design or implementation problem, but often had active discussions around privacy when stimulated by certain external events representing new privacy-enhancing restrictions from the Android operating system, app store policies, or privacy laws. Developers often felt these restrictions could cause considerable cost yet fail to generate any compelling benefit for themselves. Given these results, we present a set of suggestions for Android OS and the app store to design more effective methods to enhance privacy, and for developer forums(e.g., /r/androiddev) to encourage more in-depth privacy discussions and nudge developers to think more about privacy. We present a qualitative study of /r/androiddev, a popular subforum on Reddit focused on Android development. We studied how developers discussed personal data use and privacy using bottom-up open coding on sampled posts to develop a typology of discussions about personal data use and then conducted follow-up analyses to understand what types of posts elicited in-depth discussions on privacy issues or mentioned risky data practices. We found that developers rarely discussed privacy issues in personal data use unless stimulated by external events such as new system API designed for privacy, new app store policy updates, privacy laws, and user reviews (mostly negative reviews) about personal data use. We also found that developers frequently mentioned risky data practices related to specific app development activities but rarely discussed the potential privacy issues or how to address these issues. With our findings, we provide a set of suggestions for related stakeholders including Android OS, app store, and the developer forum to promote better privacy practices and encourage app developers to think more about privacy during app development."
Learning from Family Mysteries: Accounting for Untold Stories in Family Memory Practices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432920,"Given the importance and social significance of passing down family stories to each generation, why do important family stories not get told? How should designers of digital family storytelling platforms address missing or incomplete parts of narratives? Drawing from the results of an interview-based, practice-oriented inquiry, we argue that non-telling should be considered an important and integral part of family storytelling. Our findings show that non-telling is not simply silence. Non-telling allows family members to observe protective and discretionary values essential to the identity-making and relational goals of family storytelling. We also show ways that a person's reticence is situated and may change over time. In our discussion, we provide design strategies for family storytelling technologies to make room for silence and incorporate the values, purposes, and practices of non-telling. In this paper, we presented an argument for consider ""non-telling"" as an important component of storytelling in co-constructing the collective memory of families. Leaving a story untold, with key details missing, or only available to a select listener enables a storyteller to enact personal and family values related to their identity and care for other family members. Family memory technologies should not conflate non-use of the system with non-telling. Non-telling is a form of active participation in collective storytelling. Therefore, including non-telling as a practice is essential for family memory technologies to fully support intergenerational storytelling, where stories are passed down over time and mediated through networks of artifacts and people. To complement existing work on the capture, preservation, and sharing of family stories, we outlined strategies for design to make room for silence, enable protective discretion, find the right time, and distinguish non-telling from missed opportunities."
"To Plan or Not to Plan? A Mixed-Methods Diary Study Examining When, How and Why Knowledge Work Planning is Inaccurate",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432921,"Reliable and accurate planning is essential for modern knowledge workers. However, there is limited insight about when, how and why planning is inaccurate, and the circumstances in which those inaccuracies are troublesome. To investigate this, we asked 20 academics to keep a diary for a single work day. They estimated the duration of the tasks they wanted to achieve at the start of the day and noted down in detail the tasks they actually achieved during the day. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to complement this diary data. The diaries showed that some tasks, such as email and coding, were more susceptible to time underestimation bias while other tasks, such as writing and planning, were more susceptible to time overestimation bias in planning. Based on interviews, a typology of common reasons for delays in planned daily work is presented. It suggests that vague and optimistic planning leads to the observed discrepancy between planned and actual work. Finally, interviews suggested that participants adopted four planning strategies that vary in the frequency of planning, from minimal planning to daily, weekly and multi-level planning. We close by discussing ways support systems for accurate planning can be better designed for different use cases. The aim of this study was to investigate how, when and why knowledge work planning is inaccurate. The results showed that in general planning was not accurate because it was overly optimistic. Participants expected to work one hour longer than they did and 34% of planned work was not completed on the same day. A closer look at the data showed that different type of tasks were associated with a different magnitude of time estimation bias. This observation suggested that in the long-run writing, planning and decision-making tasks are less likely to be done to the standard they were planned due to delays in other information work tasks, such as emails. Interviews suggested that most of the types of delays could be categorised as planning failures as opposed to external interruptions. Therefore, we suggest that accuracy in planning for some groups of knowledge workers is achievable. Further, the results showed that participants chose planning strategies requiring different levels of time estimation skill depending on the nature of participantsâ workload. We hence offered implications for planning support systems aimed at different use cases. We hope that this paper can stimulate a renewed focus on accurate planning informed by the understanding that for some groups of knowledge workers accurate time estimations are a needed improvement to their workdays."
What Makes People Join Conspiracy Communities?: Role of Social Factors in Conspiracy Engagement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432922,"Widespread conspiracy theories, like those motivating anti-vaccination attitudes or climate change denial, propel collective action, and bear society-wide consequences. Yet, empirical research has largely studied conspiracy theory adoption as an individual pursuit, rather than as a socially mediated process. What makes users join communities endorsing and spreading conspiracy theories? We leverage longitudinal data from 56 conspiracy communities on Reddit to compare individual and social factors determining which users join the communities. Using a quasi-experimental approach, we first identify 30K future conspiracists?(FC) and30K matched non-conspiracists?(NC). We then provide empirical evidence of the importance of social factors across six dimensions relative to the individual factors by analyzing 6 million Reddit comments and posts. Specifically, in social factors, we find that dyadic interactions with members of the conspiracy communities and marginalization outside of the conspiracy communities are the most important social precursors to conspiracy joining-even outperforming individual factor baselines. Our results offer quantitative backing to understand social processes and echo chamber effects in conspiratorial engagement, with important implications for democratic institutions and online communities. Currently, our understanding of social factors in conspiracy adoption is patched together by mainly theoretical and very few empirical studies. This work calls into attention the importance of systematically studying how interactions with conspiracists can influence the userâs joining into the conspiracy communities. Using a theory driven framework of social factors across six dimensions, we perform a retrospective case control study of future conspiracists and compare them with non conspiracists. We not only find that the social factors are important but that conspiracy joining can be explained at least partially by at least one feature in each group. Given these findings, we offer a unique, empirically backed perspective on the life-cycle of conspiracists, echo chambers in conspiracy communities and the effect of social exclusion in conspiracy engagement."
Daughters of Men: Saudi Women's Sociotechnical Agency Practices in Addressing Domestic Abuse,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432923,"While domestic abuse is an all too common experience for women worldwide, how people experience the abuse and their resources to deal with the abuse differ. In this qualitative, interview-based study, we examine Saudi women's domestic safety concerns living in Saudi Arabia and the United States. Based on non-Western Islamic feminist views of agency, we identify three key practices, focused on how women resist or deal with their domestic violence. For each practice, we highlight how interwoven cultural, religious, and political contexts impact Saudi women's ability to recognize and deal with domestic abuse. We attend to technology's role in enabling or hindering women's agency. These practices include: 1) recognizing abuse, where women identify abusive situations, 2) managing abuse, where women find ways to cope with ongoing or anticipated abuse within their constraints and resources, and 3) seeking non-abusive futures, where women decide how to mitigate the abuse or leave their abuser. Given domestic violence's complicated nature, we highlight several key design recommendations based on women's values. In this study, we investigated Saudi womenâs understanding of and experience with domestic abuse, their agency practices in mitigating the abuse, and the role of technology in those practices. We found that leaving an abusive situation was not common. Rather, Saudi women build their resilience and find ways to work within their constraints. Women also used mediation of family members, community leaders, and professional services to reconcile with the abuser or to remove them from the situation. Our participants used ICTs including social media to stay updated with laws and regulations through official accounts, mobile applications to stay informed about legal rights, and referred to educational content to strengthen their resilience. Based on our findings, we proposed design implications to empower women from within the existing sociocultural fabric of Saudi Arabia by focusing on designing for their values. In particular, we make recommendations for the design of technologies that support the values of religious piety, social cohesion and agency, and patience and resiliency."
ProtoChat: Supporting the Conversation Design Process with Crowd Feedback,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432924,"Similar to a design process for designing graphical user interfaces, conversation designers often apply an iterative design process by defining a conversation flow, testing with users, reviewing user data, and improving the design. While it is possible to iterate on conversation design with existing chatbot prototyping tools, there still remain challenges in recruiting participants on-demand and collecting structured feedback on specific conversational components. These limitations hinder designers from running rapid iterations and making informed design decisions. We posit that involving a crowd in the conversation design process can address these challenges, and introduce ProtoChat, a crowd-powered chatbot design tool built to support the iterative process of conversation design. ProtoChat makes it easy to recruit crowd workers to test the current conversation within the design tool. ProtoChat's crowd-testing tool allows crowd workers to provide concrete and practical feedback and suggest improvements on specific parts of the conversation. With the data collected from crowd-testing, ProtoChat provides multiple types of visualizations to help designers analyze and revise their design. Through a three-day study with eight designers, we found that ProtoChat enabled an iterative design process for designing a chatbot. Designers improved their design by not only modifying the conversation design itself, but also adjusting the persona and getting UI design implications beyond the conversation design itself. The crowd responses were helpful for designers to explore user needs, contexts, and diverse response formats. With ProtoChat, designers can successfully collect concrete evidence from the crowd and make decisions to iteratively improve their conversation design. The core value of our system is inviting the crowd into the conversation design process to support iterations on chatbot conversation design. ProtoChat enables rapid testing with the crowd and guiding the crowd workers to provide granular feedback on specific points of conversation. With the crowdsourced data, ProtoChat provides interactive visualizations which help designers to make informed decisions."
"Making it Work, or Not: A Longitudinal Study of Career Trajectories Among Online Freelancers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432925,"Online freelancing is growing rapidly. However, despite this rapid growth, we have a limited understanding of online freelancers' long-term experiences and evolution, or how online freelancing influences freelancers' broader career goals. To address this gap, we interviewed a set of online freelancers at two time periods, two and a half years apart. We found that long-term engagement with online freelancing involves a unique set of financial, emotional, relational, and reputational burdens that represent the overhead of maintaining an online freelancing career. We found that this overhead influenced online freelancers' participation and perceptions of online freelancing over time, as well as the strategies some freelancers employed to manage their careers. Our findings further highlight how online freelance platforms can afford unique career development opportunities over a longer period of time, including career exploration and transition, entrepreneurial training and reputation, and skills transfer. Based on our findings, we present policy and design implications to increase the sustainability and accessibility of online freelancing. Online freelancing represents a new and increasingly important form of work, with enormous flexibility and precarity, independence and uncertainty, potential and challenges. Through our longitudinal study of online freelancersâ career trajectories over a period of more than two years, we found that online freelance platforms afforded three cross-cutting career development opportunities: career domain exploration and transition, entrepreneurial training, and reputation and skills transfer. At the same time, a nuanced picture emerged of the unique overhead of maintaining an online freelancing career, the influence of this overhead on participation over time and the strategies freelancers employ to adapt. Based on our longitudinal findings, we suggest a set of implications for future research, policy and design to help minimize the risks and overhead of online freelancing and support online freelancersâ career trajectories."
Using Data to Approach the Unknown: Patients' and Healthcare Providers? Data Practices in Fertility Challenges,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432926,"Medical practices have always been data oriented: healthcare providers decisions are based on data, both clinically generated and patient reported. With the increased use of patient-generated health data (PGHD), other types of data are entering providers? practices and influencing patient-provider collaboration. We studied the use of PGHD and its related data practices in the context of fertility, a health concern that is uncertain, complex, and data intensive. We interviewed 14 patients who are facing or have faced challenges to conceive and 5 healthcare providers specialized in infertility. Our findings show that patients and providers use PGHD in different ways but with the common goal of exploring 'the unknown' generated by the uncertainties of fertility. Providers use patients? data in a rational protocol, aiming to identify possible causes of infertility and define a treatment course. Patients use data in a much more emotional way, learning about their bodies while struggling with data interpretation challenges. By analyzing these data practices, we discuss the principles behind their differences and describe how they have individual benefits for each specific group. We then suggest that fertility technologies need to consider such principles, highlight the existing boundary between patients' and providers' data practices, and focus on bridging instead of merging them in order to facilitate collaboration and maintain their independent benefits. Medical practices have always been data oriented. With the rise of PGHD other types of data are entering these practices and influencing patient-provider collaboration. We studied the use of PGHD and related data practices in the context of an uncertain, complex, and data-intensive health concern: fertility with the goal of conception. Our findings show that patients and providers use PGHD differently but with the common goal of exploring âthe unknown.â Providers use patientsâ data in a rational protocol, aiming to identify infertility causes and define a treatment course. Patients use data in a much more emotional way, learning about their bodies while struggling with challenges in data interpretation. We discuss that both these practices have benefits for their specific groups and that the principles that drive them should be considered and supported when developing fertility technologies. Finally, we suggest that fertility technologies should aim to make the boundary between patientsâ and providersâ data practices more visible so their practices can be bridged, facilitating collaboration when necessary and also maintaining their independent benefits."
Narrative Maps: An Algorithmic Approach to Represent and Extract Information Narratives,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432927,"Narratives are fundamental to our perception of the world and are pervasive in all activities that involve the representation of events in time. Yet, modern online information systems do not incorporate narratives in their representation of events occurring over time. This article aims to bridge this gap, combining the theory of narrative representations with the data from modern online systems. We make three key contributions: a theory-driven computational representation of narratives, a novel extraction algorithm to obtain these representations from data, and an evaluation of our approach. In particular, given the effectiveness of visual metaphors, we employ a route map metaphor to design a narrative map representation. The narrative map representation illustrates the events and stories in the narrative as a series of landmarks and routes on the map. Each element of our representation is backed by a corresponding element from formal narrative theory, thus providing a solid theoretical background to our method. Our approach extracts the underlying graph structure of the narrative map using a novel optimization technique focused on maximizing coherence while respecting structural and coverage constraints. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by performing a user evaluation to assess the quality of the representation, metaphor, and visualization. Evaluation results indicate that the Narrative Map representation is a powerful method to communicate complex narratives to individuals. Our findings have implications for intelligence analysts, computational journalists, and misinformation researchers. This paper presents an algorithmic approach to represent and extract narratives using narrative maps. Based on a comprehensive survey of formal narrative theory, we outline a computational representation of narratives comprising eight elements. We used an intuitive route map metaphor to connect the elements, their metaphoric renditions, and their computational counterparts. Building upon existing approaches of story extraction, we designed a novel optimization-based approach to extract the underlying graph representing a narrative map. In particular, we seek to maximize the coherence of the map, subject to structural and coverage constraints. Using this graph, we then extract the main storylines and the representative landmarks of the narrative map. These help us characterize the major themes in a narrative. We presented a detailed case study following the Coronavirus outbreak during its first month. We explored the major events and identified the major themes surrounding the outbreak. This extended example helped us demonstrate how an analyst could leverage our representation to understand the evolution of a narrative. Next, we presented a user evaluation of our method considering three aspects: the narrative representation itself, the effectiveness of the metaphor, and the usability of the visualization. While there are still some aspects that could be improved, our evaluation results demonstrate that our narrative map proposal fulfills its intended purpose. This work opens up multiple avenues for future research, such as adapting the current approach to another type of data (e.g., images) or to a different field (e.g., helping psychologists analyze personal narratives) or extending the narrative map representation by adding contextual information. In particular, incorporating measures of source bias and credibility into our representation could pave the way towards modeling how misinformation propagates in news narratives."
How We Write with Crowds,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432928,"Writing is a common task for crowdsourcing researchers exploring complex and creative work. To better understand how we write with crowds, we conducted both a literature review of crowd-writing systems and structured interviews with designers of such systems. We argue that the cognitive process theory of writing described by Flower and Hayes (1981), originally proposed as a theory of how solo writers write, offers a useful analytic lens for examining the design of crowd-writing systems. This lens enabled us to identify system design challenges that are inherent to the process of writing as well as design challenges that are introduced by crowdsourcing. The findings present both similarities and differences between how solo writers write versus how we write with crowds. To conclude, we discuss how the research community might apply and transcend the cognitive process model to identify opportunities for future research in crowd-writing systems. In this paper, we describe the design of crowdsourcing systems to generate original written text (called crowd-writing systems), through an analysis of 24 research papers and interviews with their authors. The analysis applied the cognitive process model of writing [16] as an analytical lens, which we used to group similar system designs together. In total, we identified 38 unique design decisions. Our analysis found that the literature review included design patterns that relate to each of the writing components described in the cognitive process model, but our analysis also highlights design patterns that are specific to crowdsourcing. Our findings suggest future opportunities for research, both in the analysis and design of crowd-writing systems."
My Team Will Go On: Differentiating High and Low Viability Teams through Team Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432929,"Understanding team viability --- a team's capacity for sustained and future success --- is essential for building effective teams. In this study, we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to train a viability classification model over a dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams. We train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. We find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 AUC ROC under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. From these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as 'but' and 'except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. Only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction. This work suggests opportunities for teams to assess, track, and visualize their own viability in real time as they collaborate. Recognizing the importance of team viability â rather than performance â in effective collaboration, we study signals of team viability in text interaction data of remote teams. Our machine learning models using features motivated by previous literature can reliably differentiate teams that belong to the top decile, above median, and the bottom decile of viability scores. Further investigation of the models suggest that while the use of exclusive language and second person pronouns are associated with higher viability teams across thresholds, other behaviors are unique to distinguishing the top decile, such as higher average reading level, and the bottom decile, such as sadness and displays of extreme emotions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the relationship between viability and team interaction is consistent over time, yet the pattern differs by de novo teams and reconvened teams. Finally, we find that signals from the initial moments of interaction are sufficient for successful prediction of the whole interaction, which suggests that viability can be evaluated and acted upon early. The strength of our models using automated features indicate opportunities for real time assessment of viability, which lends further space for intervention."
Conducting Risky Research with Teens: Co-designing for the Ethical Treatment and Protection of Adolescents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432930,"The methods in which we study the online experiences of adolescents should be evidence-based and informed by youth. This is especially true when studying sensitive topics, such as the online risk behaviors of minors. We directly engaged 20 adolescents (ages 12-18) in the co-design of two different research methodologies (i.e., diary studies and analyzing social media trace data) for conducting adolescent online safety research. We also interviewed 13 of their parents to understand their perspectives. Overall, teens wanted to share their personal experiences and benefit society, while parents wanted researchers to tackle a topic that they felt was a prevalent problem for teens. Yet, they both had significant concerns regarding data privacy of the sensitive disclosures made by teens during such studies. Teens' feared getting in trouble. Participants emphasized the importance of developing a trusting relationship with the researcher to overcome these concerns. Participants also saw the potential for using the research study as a tool for risk-reporting and mitigation, where researchers could act as liaisons between the teens and other parties (e.g., counselors, law enforcement, parents) to share pertinent risk details and facilitate resources or even help teens directly by giving them strategies for mitigating online risks they encountered during the study. Our research delves into important ethical considerations for conducting risk-focused research with adolescents and uncovers the critical need for designing risk-based research for youth protection. We provide researchers with heuristic guidelines for conducting ethical research with vulnerable populations (i.e., adolescents) and keeping participants safe while doing so. We developed heuristic guidelines and a risk mitigation plan that move beyond existing ethical principles to consider youth protection for risk-related research. Further, researchers must consider the tools they use for collecting teensâ sensitive information and optimize them for the target audience. Therefore, we provide implications for designing technologies that engage adolescent participants by providing them control over their data and support for navigating risk experiences. We urge other HCI researchers investigating sensitive topics with teens that involve more than minimal risk to prioritize the wellbeing of adolescent participants and use this paper as a resource to ensure the protection of youth. Conducting risk-based research with adolescents often warrants teens to disclose highly sensitive information that may pose significant ethical challenges (e.g., legal liability concerns) for researchers. Consequently, researchers often hesitate to take on such high-risk research, despite its importance and value in improving the lives of youth. As HCI researchers, we have the responsibility to do no harm, but we have the equal responsibility to benefit the vulnerable populations we aim to serve. Further, while this paper is specific to adolescents, there is potential for our overall findings to translate to research with other marginalized or vulnerable populations, who may feel or be at risk when participating in research, but still desire to benefit society through their participation."
"To ""See"" is to Stereotype: Image Tagging Algorithms, Gender Recognition, and the Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432931,"Machine-learned computer vision algorithms for tagging images are increasingly used by developers and researchers, having become popularized as easy-to-use ""cognitive services."" Yet these tools struggle with gender recognition, particularly when processing images of women, people of color and non-binary individuals. Socio-technical researchers have cited data bias as a key problem; training datasets often over-represent images of people and contexts that convey social stereotypes. The social psychology literature explains that people learn social stereotypes, in part, by observing others in particular roles and contexts, and can inadvertently learn to associate gender with scenes, occupations and activities. Thus, we study the extent to which image tagging algorithms mimic this phenomenon. We design a controlled experiment, to examine the interdependence between algorithmic recognition of context and the depicted person's gender. In the spirit of auditing to understand machine behaviors, we create a highly controlled dataset of people images, imposed on gender-stereotyped backgrounds. Our methodology is reproducible and our code publicly available. Evaluating five proprietary algorithms, we find that in three, gender inference is hindered when a background is introduced. Of the two that ""see"" both backgrounds and gender, it is the one whose output is most consistent with human stereotyping processes that is superior in recognizing gender. We discuss the accuracy--fairness trade-off, as well as the importance of auditing black boxes in better understanding this double-edged sword. The current research highlights the importance of not taking ML-based systemsâ output for granted. Although cognitive services provide a convenient means for developers to enhance their applications and services with state-of-the-art capabilities, there is a real potential to carry any inherent biases downstream, thus impacting other users. Likewise, researchers using proprietary ITAs to understand large-scale visual communication patterns on social platforms, need to be especially sensitive when processing images depicting people. Through controlled experiments, we can attempt to understand and analyze the behavior of proprietary, black box systems, with respect to how they treat different social groups, and whether they do so in a manner that is consistent with human social norms. At the same time, it is important to appreciate that the behaviors observed during an audit may not translate fully to real world performance, where ITAs analyze images in the wild. Following research in psychology, stereotypes drive the way people interact with each other, the assumptions people make of others and in some occasions, peopleâs future decisions for fulfilling societyâs stereotypical expectations. There is enough evidence in the literature that social stereotypes make their way into cognitive services and that they are able to at least partly affect usersâ perception. In addition, in extreme cases, ITAs can embody modern versions of physiognomy, a debunked Victorian pseudoscience that has been experiencing recent rebirth [20, 99]. As such, auditing ITAs, both in terms of their training data [88] as well as their output, ethically evaluates the role such services play. We have seen that the cognitive services that were audited here, are not consistent in how they treat gender (men/women) with or without a social context. Among those that were more consistent, Clarifai âseesâ more women and men when they appear in a stereotypically feminine or masculine context respectively, while Amazon âseesâ more men in that context and understands context in a better way when gender is perceived. As a result of the controlled experimental approach adopted in this work, we were able to capture evidence of inconsistencies â violations of the group fairness notion â by the cognitive services that need further research. The findings based on race were particularly notable, as both Clarifai and Amazonâs descriptions of images for images of Blacks and Asians were less stable, changing with the background context, as compared to others. The recent approach of Google to remove gender-related tags from ITA tag-sets, while done to mitigate social bias, does not provide a comprehensive solution to the underlying problem (e.g., [10]). Service creators as well as developers who are using the services in their systems need to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all approach when comes to deciding on fairness versus accuracy. There are applications where gender inferences can be irrelevant and should be taken out, but there are also scenarios, like dating applications [54], where gender and/or race stereotyping can have a huge impact on someoneâs life and well-being. Therefore, auditing using multiple datasets is important for understanding the benefits and harm that a black box service might cause when deployed and real people are affected by its output."
Agency and Extraction in Emerging Industrial Drone Applications: Imaginaries of Rwandan Farm Workers and Community Members,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432932,"Rapidly diffusing 'industry 4.0' technologies stand to impact a broad range of stakeholders. Prior to implementation, forward looking formative analyses can identify systems and policy designs to promote equitable benefit. We investigate this potential through an analysis of stakeholders to a potential drone implementation on a small commercial farm in Rwanda. Translating stakeholders' imaginaries within a post-colonial frame, we identify hopes and concerns related to agency and influenced by global and local systems of power. The findings highlight constraints that recommend system designs promoting local agency and control and policies designed to balance local data management against potentially 'extractive' multinational data transfer processes."
I Can't Breathe: Reflections from Black Women in CSCW and HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432933,"In this paper, three Black women in HCI and CSCW share their experiences of being Black women academics enduring a global pandemic that is disportionately impacting the Black community while simultaneously experiencing the civil unrest due to racial injustice and police brutality. Using Black feminist epistemologies as a theoretical framework and auto-ethnography and testimonial authority as both methodology and epistemic resistance, the authors exercise epistemic agency to testify to their lived intersectional experiences and the various fronts on which they fight to be seen, to be heard, and to live. Additionally, they advocate for more inclusionary policies of Black women and other marginalized populations within the CSCW and HCI communities. We conclude with a call to action for both communities to: 1) stand in solidarity with Blacks in computing; and 2) acknowledge, disavow, and dismantle Whiteness and oppressive power structures in the field of computing, specifically HCI and CSCW. Given the history of oppression as it relates to the African diaspora, we must all educate ourselves about racism and power and acknowledge our role in each. What is happening here in our field is a mirror of what is happening in the world. However, because we as Black women have heard it all before, sustainable efforts are necessary to invoke social change. At this moment in time, people of diverse backgrounds are empowered, posting their experiences and perspectives on social media and physically marching in protest in the streets as an act of solidarity. What can our allies do to stop the vicious cycle of racism at work within the CSCW and HCI communities? Plenty! And in this paper, we emphasize a few concrete yet simple steps that anyone can do. Additional steps outlined by other Black people and White allies that are not mentioned in this paper should also be considered. In the words of one co-author, I can only think about and deal with what Iâm feeling and experiencing right now. As Black women, this fight takes an emotional, physical, and spiritual toil. What happens when the camera stops rolling and this is no longer front pages news? As Black feminists and scholars, this is not a matter of choice for us. We are fighting for our lives, rejecting disingenuous acts (e.g., performative anti-racism, photo opportunities) that portray feeble attempts to address systemic racism. As a community of scholars, we must acknowledge the âwall of Whitenessâ [102] that exists within CSCW and HCI communities and dismantle the oppressive power structures that obstruct social justice in the field of computing."
Explainable Active Learning (XAL): Toward AI Explanations as Interfaces for Machine Teachers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432934,"The wide adoption of Machine Learning (ML) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ML models. Some advocated the term ""machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ML models. This ""teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-AI interfaces. One promising learning paradigm is Active Learning (AL), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. However, in current AL settings, the human-AI interface remains minimal and opaque. A dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for AL algorithms. In this work, we begin considering AI explanations as a core element of the human-AI interface for teaching machines. When a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. When a ML model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. When the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. Toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (XAL), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable AI (XAI) into an AL setting. We conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with XAL, to that of traditional AL and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). Our study shows benefits of AI explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. Our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to AI explanations, including task knowledge, AI experience and Need for Cognition. By reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for XAL, and more broadly, machine teaching through AI explanations. While active learning has gained popularity for its learning efficiency, it has not been widely considered as an HCI problem despite its interactive nature. We propose explainable active learning (XAL), by utilizing a popular local explanation method as the interface for an AL algorithm. Instead of opaquely requesting labels for selected instances, the model presents its own prediction and explanation for its prediction, then requests feedback from the human. We posit that this new paradigm not only addresses annotatorsâ needs for model transparency, but also opens up opportunities for new learning algorithms that learn from human feedback for the model explanations. Broadly, XAL allows training ML models to more closely resemble a âteachingâ experience, and places explanations as a central element of machine teaching. We conducted an experiment to both test the feasibility of XAL and serve as an elicitation study to identify the types of feedback people naturally want to provide. The experiment demonstrated that explanations could help people monitor the model learning progress and calibrate their trust in the teaching outcome. But our results cautioned against the adverse effect of explanations in anchoring peopleâs judgment to the naive modelâs, if the annotator lacks adequate knowledge to detect the modelâs faulty reasoning, and the additional workload that could avert people with low Need for Cognition. Besides providing a systematic understanding of user interaction with AL algorithms, our results have three broad implications for using model explanations as the interface for machine teaching. First, we highlight the design goals of explanations applied to the context of teaching a learning model, as distinct from common goals in XAI literature, including calibrating trust, mitigating anchoring effect and minimizing cognitive workload. Second, we identify important individual factors that mediate peopleâs preferences and reception to model explanations, including task knowledge, AI experience and Need for Cognition. Lastly, we enumerate on the types of feedback people naturally want to provide for model explanations, to inspire future algorithmic work to incorporate such feedback."
Better Feedback from Nicer People: Narrative Empathy and Ingroup Framing Improve Feedback Exchange,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432935,"Online feedback exchange platforms enable content creators to collect a diverse set of design feedback quickly. However, creators can experience low quality and harsh feedback when using such platforms. In this paper, we leverage the empathy of the feedback provider to address both these issues. Specifically, we tested two narrative-based empathy arousal interventions: a negative experience and a design process narrative. We also examined whether ingroup framing further enhances the effects of empathy arousal. In a 3x2 online experiment, participants (n=205) wrote feedback on a poster design after experiencing one of the intervention conditions or a control condition. Our results show both the design process narrative and ingroup framing conditions significantly increased the feedback quality and effort invested in the task. The negative experience narrative condition had similar effects and participants reported significantly increased disapproval towards harsh feedback. We discuss the implications of our results for the design of feedback exchange platforms. The results of the experiment reported in this paper showed that the narrative empathy interventions, including reading narratives about a prior negative experience and reading about the design process related to the current project, and ingroup framing both improved feedback quality and increased effort invested in the task. When reading a negative experience narrative, participants reported a more disapproving stance towards harsh feedback and more likely to intervene if observed in practice. Our work contributes new interventions that platform designers can implement to further improve the feedback exchange process."
"""I was afraid, but now I enjoy being a streamer!"": Understanding the Challenges and Prospects of Using Live Streaming for Online Education",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432936,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to a sharp transition from offline to online education in many countries and areas. This transition heightens the intensity of existing challenges of online education, such as student attendance and education equality. During this time of uncertainty, the vast disparities in teachers? online experience and technical backgrounds, students' education level and their families' economic status, and schools' support, further pose new challenges to teachers and students. In this work, we study how Chinese teachers and students addressed challenges during this transition. We interviewed 15 teachers and 18 students from diverse backgrounds at varying education levels (K-12 and college). Our work makes timely and new contributions to the literature of online education. For example, our results showed that teachers applied Live Video Streaming (LVS) on multiple social media platforms and re-purposed different entertainment features to deliver online teaching for better student engagement; some teachers came to enjoy this new form of instruction after being resistant to it in the beginning, and students developed a better sense of intimacy with their teachers after experiencing certain online interactions. Our work also reveals the remaining challenges and prospects of LVS-based online education and sheds light on the future design of collaborative technologies for online education. The social, ethical and technical aspects of online education have been widely discussed in prior work, but limited studies have discussed the application of live video streaming in online education, especially in a situation where there is no face-to-face option. Our research explores the challenges, practice and prospects that live video streaming brings to online education. Our findings show that challenges such as real-time interaction and engagement, technical uncertainty, ethical issues such as privacy and copyright, and impression management remain severe in LVSbased online teaching, which are mentioned in other ways of online teaching. However, live video streaming offers more opportunities for online education, including but not limited to increasing intimacy between students and teachers, and entertainment functions that promote participation. This mobile-supported approach helps to narrow the technological accessibility of students from different backgrounds when they transition to online education in this emergency, which promotes educational equality. Our research can provide insights for scholars, system designers, and practitioners to address potential problems in the transition to online education."
Socio-Spatial Comfort: Using Vision-based Analysis to Inform User-Centred Human-Building Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432937,"A well-designed workplace has a direct and significant impact on our work experiences and productivity. In this paper, we investigate how office interior layouts influence the way we socially experience office buildings. We extend the previous work that examined static social formations of office workers by looking at their dynamic movements during informal desk visiting interactions. With a month of video data collected in the office, we implemented a vision-based analysis system that enables us to examine how people occupy space in social contexts in relation to desk configurations. The results showed that both social territoriality and approach path highlight social comfort in human-building interactions, which are different from efficiency or path optimization. From these findings, we propose the concepts of socio-spatial comfort: social buffers, privacy buffers, and varying proxemics to inform a user-centered way of designing human building interactions and architecture. This paper made an attempt to understand socio-spatial comfort with respect to spatial layouts in order to bridge the notion of social computing and human building interactions with a user-centered perspective, focusing on informal collaborations at personal desks. Our preliminary study revealed that socio-spatial comfort is a type of tacit knowledge which can be captured by collecting and finding patterns from peopleâs embodied interactions in-the-wild. Therefore, we proposed a vision-based analysis method to systematically capture the micro-physical movements of people who socially occupy the space over time, and visualize the outputs with different levels of focus (aggregated overview, temporal overview, path overview, and pose overview). By aligning the findings with interview results, we found that the occupantâs behaviours while approaching and interacting with people are not based on efficiency but vary at each desk configuration due to diverse aspects of social perceptions. These insights have driven our theoretical concept of socio-spatial comfort (social buffer, privacy buffer, and varying proxemics) to illustrate how the dynamic movements in the physical space can contribute to comfortable social interaction experiences. We argue that socio-spatial comfort can not be estimated simply by visibility-oriented privacy metrics [15], social territoriality [7, 96] or static proxemic distance [46]; rather it is based on the co-relational mapping between human social perceptions and micro spatial zones, which can be derived from real-world data. We believe that socio-spatial comfort could be an essential concept in designing comfortable experiences for human building interactions. Understanding the key factors of these experiences can also support the adaptation of space layouts as well as designing pervasive environments, including intelligent objects (displays) and telepresence robots."
"Body, Avatar, and Me: The Presentation and Perception of Self in Social Virtual Reality",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432938,"Self-presentation in online digital social spaces has been a long standing research interest in HCI and CSCW. As online social spaces evolve towards more embodied digital representations, it is important to understand how users construct and experience their self and interact with others' self in new and more complicated ways, as it may introduce new opportunities and unseen social consequences. Using findings of an interview study (N=30), in this paper we report an in-depth empirical investigation of the presentation and perception of self in Social Virtual Reality (VR) - 3D virtual spaces where multiple users can interact with one another through VR head-mounted displays and full-body tracked avatars. This study contributes to the growing body of CSCW literature on social VR by offering empirical evidence of how social VR platforms afford new phenomena and approaches of novel identity practices and by providing potential design implications to further support such practices. We also expand the existing research agenda in CSCW on the increasing complexity of people's self-presentation in emerging novel sociotechnical systems. As commercial social VR applications continue to rise in popularity, how do these novel online digital spaces afford new forms of identity practices and embodied self? Our investigation has yielded three key findings. First, social VR users tend to present themselves consistently with their offline identity, even when they sometimes construct platform-specific self-presentation. Second, four aspects (aesthetics, gender, race, and age/maturity) are important for social VR users to perceive, approach, and interact with each other. Third, the process of constructing and perceiving identity in social VR allow social VR users to experience their everyday self in a new way, discover oneâs unknown self, or explore alternative gender identity. Therefore, we suggest that the nuance of self presentation in social VR sheds light on 1) the potential of consistent digital representation; 2) a more complicated interaction dynamic regarding avatar representation involving the essential role of voice; and 3) new perspectives of the proteus effect regarding the body-avatar relationship and different levels of body ownership. Based on these findings, we also propose three potential design implications for further supporting usersâ self-presentation practices in social VR: avatar design for presenting cultural identity and gender identity; platform embedded voice modulators; and alternatives to full body tracked avatars. We believe that our focus on self-presentation in social VR contributes to CSCW literature on social VR and nuanced self-presentation in emerging novel sociotechnical systems. We also hope that these insights and findings may inform potential directions for designing more meaningful, thought provoking self presentation experiences and identity practices online."
A Dozen Stickers on a Mailbox: Physical Encounters and Digital Interactions in a Local Sharing Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432939,"Many non-profit peer-to-peer exchange arrangements and profit-driven, multi-sided online marketplaces leverage underutilized resources, such as tools, to optimize their use to capacity. They often rely on a digital platform in pursuit of their social aspirations and/or economic objectives. We report on a field study of a local sharing community that employs a set of stickers illustrating different household items, typically placed on community members' mailboxes, along with complementary digital tools. The stickers are used to communicate the availability of resources among neighbors to facilitate social encounters and to encourage sustainable use and re-use of shared resources. Through in-depth qualitative interviews with sixteen participants, we describe the opportunities and limitations of this approach to peer-to-peer exchange. We offer insights for designers of resource sharing communities into facilitating face-to-face encounters and the online interactions needed to support them. Our paper offers two main contributions. First, it systematically describes the practices of one resource sharing community. We detailed membersâ tactics for handling peer-to-peer exchange among neighbors, outlined interactional difficulties within the community, and examined how members use and make sense of the physical and digital tools that facilitate the sharing of household items. We also identified and discussed the challenges and opportunities of the Pumpipumpe lowtech model in sustaining a sharing community over time. Second, we elicited a set of design recommendations for resource sharing communities. These aim to maintain the delicate interplay among face-to-face encounters and digital interactions. We hope that this study inspires HCI and CSCW researchers to further engage in studying non-profit sharing economy communities and in designing systems that can better support their efforts to promote sharing cultures and to advance social, economic, and environmental sustainability within their environments."
A System for Interleaving Discussion and Summarization in Online Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432940,"In many instances of online collaboration, ideation and deliberation about what to write happen separately from the synthesis of the deliberation into a cohesive document. However, this may result in a final document that has little connection to the discussion that came before. In this work, we present interleaved discussion and summarization, a process where discussion and summarization are woven together in a single space, and collaborators can switch back and forth between discussing ideas and summarizing discussion until it results in a final document that incorporates and references all discussion points. We implement this process into a tool called Wikum+ that allows groups working together on a project to create living summaries-artifacts that can grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and shrink as collaborators come to consensus. We conducted studies where groups of six people each collaboratively wrote a proposal using Wikum+ and a proposal using a messaging platform along with Google Docs. We found that Wikum+'s integration of discussion and summarization helped users be more organized, allowing for light-weight coordination and iterative improvements throughout the collaboration process. A second study demonstrated that in larger groups, Wikum+ is more inclusive of all participants and more comprehensive in the final document compared to traditional tools. In this work, we designed, developed, and evaluated a process for interleaved discussion and summarization and a system called Wikum+ that allows groups to collaboratively create a living summary artifact directly through the synthesis of their discussions. By interchanging discussion, where new ideas and feedback grow the conversation, and summarization, where consensus and synthesis shrink the conversation, resulting documents can be continuously refined. From our lab studies, we found that Wikum+ allowed for greater organization and light-weight coordination in smaller groups, and more inclusion and comprehensiveness of the resulting document in larger groups."
"Piracy and the Impaired Cyborg: Assistive Technologies, Accessibility, and Access",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432941,"This paper examines software piracy in the Global South from an accessibility lens, using the bio-technical metaphor of the 'cyborg.' Drawing on qualitative interviews with people with visual impairment (VI) from India and Peru, the paper interrogates the intimate relationships that users have with assistive technologies (ATs). It outlines the effectiveness of ATs in allowing users to actively control and shape their own lives and identities, and describes the various modalities that regulate the human body, technology, and human body-technology linkages. The paper argues that software piracy, when looked through the lens of the 'cyborg,' is an act of self-making that is motivated by a desire to gain autonomy and independence, i.e., it can be understood as a way to overcome the barriers that undermine access to the technological self. Further, software piracy allows a shift in the distribution of power from those who control and regulate the assistive technologies to the cyborgs themselves."
Pulling Back the Curtain on the Wizards of Oz,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432942,"The Wizard of Oz method is an increasingly common practice in HCI and CSCW studies as part of iterative design processes for interactive systems. Instead of designing a fully-fledged system, the 'technical work' of key system components is completed by human operators yet presented to study participants as if computed by a machine. However, little is known about how Wizard of Oz studies are interactionally and collaboratively achieved in situ by researchers and participants. By adopting an ethnomethodological perspective, we analyse our use of the method in studies with a voice-controlled vacuum robot and two researchers present. We present data that reveals how such studies are organised and presented to participants and unpack the coordinated orchestration work that unfolds 'behind the scenes' to complete the study. We examine how the researchers attend to participant requests and technical breakdowns, and discuss the performative, collaborative, and methodological nature of their work. We conclude by offering insights from our application of the approach to others in the HCI and CSCW communities for using the method. The Wizard of Oz method is used in studies of users with prototypical technologies that include some form of simulated âintelligenceâ. Participants are not made aware of this simulated component, with the approach necessitating users be presented with a fiction on the grounds of methodical validity. We examined our practice of the method in the context of seeking to understand how users instruct a voice-controlled vacuum robot. The analysis in this paper does not just focus on âthe Wizardâ, i.e. the person who covertly controls the simulated vacuum robot, but also how the method is collaboratively organised between multiple researchers ârunning the studyâ and the participants. We identified how this routine organisation draws upon preparatory resources including a protocol and an outline script, and is rehearsed through pilots. These resources were used to scaffold and coordinate the actions between the researchers during the studies due to there being no opportunity for direct communication. In discussing our findings, we synthesised the methodological, performative, and cooperative work, identifying the on-the-fly nature of implementing the method as required by the experimental contingencies. We closed our discussion with insights for researchers and designers to apply the method and conclude that these experiments should be regarded as cooperatively accomplished trials, enabled by the preparatory resources and rehearsal, and underpinned by the methodological obligation to uphold the established fiction."
Probing User Perceptions of On-Skin Notification Displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432943,"On-skin displays are emerging as a wearable form factor for the display of information; however, the perception of using such devices in public could determine whether they are eventually adopted or rejected. This study investigated the means by which on-skin notification displays are perceived by the general public. We adopted a mixed-methods approach to the analysis of results from an online survey (n = 254) and in-lab interviews (n = 36) pertaining to the novel form factor, device materiality, and envisioned use cases. The study was conducted in the US and Taiwan in order to examine cross-cultural attitudes toward device usage. The results of this structured examination provide valuable insights into the design of on-skin notification displays for everyday use across cultures. This paper presents a cross-cultural examination of user perceptions pertaining to a color-changing on-skin display device. The first stage involved an online survey to probe first-person perspectives, and the second stage involved a lab experiment using an actual SkinDisplay device as a material probe to elicit first-person perspectives. Semi-structured interviews were used to gain deeper insights into the potential usage of the device and its overall appearance. We identified a number of culturally-sensitive concepts applicable to the design of on-skin displays, such as the heightened importance of color in relation to the skin tone of users, and preferences towards the materiality and speed of notifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine societal perceptions of on-skin color-changing displays. As on-skin wearable displays become increasingly miniaturized, it will be necessary to uncover user attitudes in tandem with device development in order to create on-skin interfaces that are not only highly functional, but also considerate to broader social and cultural sensitivities."
Unequal Impacts of Augmented Reality on Learning and Collaboration During Robot Programming with Peers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432944,"Augmented reality (AR) applications are growing in popularity in educational settings. While the effects of AR experiences on learning have been widely studied, there is relatively less research on understanding the impact of AR on the dynamics of co-located collaborative learning, specifically in the context of novices programming robots. Educational robotics are a powerful learning context because they engage students with problem solving, critical thinking, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) concepts, and collaboration skills. However, such collaborations can suffer due to students having unequal access to resources or dominant peers. In this research we investigate how augmented reality impacts learning and collaboration while peers engage in robot programming activities. We use a mixed methods approach to measure how participants are learning, manipulating resources, and engaging in problem solving activities with peers. We investigate how these behaviors are impacted by the presence of augmented reality visualizations, and by participants? proximity to resources. We find that augmented reality improved overall group learning and collaboration. Detailed analysis shows that AR strongly helps one participant more than the other, by improving their ability to learn and contribute while remaining engaged with the robot. Furthermore, augmented reality helps both participants maintain a common ground and balance contributions during problem solving activities. We discuss the implications of these results for designing AR and non-AR collaborative interfaces. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of collaborators engaging in a problem solving of robot programming activities, in conditions where collaborators either used or did not use augmented reality technology as a systemic aid. Overall, our observations suggest that the use of augmented reality in a collaborative problem solving environment has a positive impact on group learning and collaboration. Detailed analysis showed that AR significantly helped one participant more than the other, allowing them to gain deeper understanding of learning content and contribute to the team collaboration. Furthermore, augmented reality helped both participants remain balanced in their contributions during the problem solving activities. These findings suggest that the application of AR in problem solving environments could promote balanced collaboration in environments with unequal access to resources, and support group learning more generally."
"""An Ideal Human"": Expectations of AI Teammates in Human-AI Teaming",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432945,"Driven by state-of-the-art AI technologies, human-AI collaboration has become an important area in computer-supported teamwork research. While human-AI collaboration has been investigated in various domains, more research is needed to explore human perceptions and expectations of AI teammates in human-AI teaming. To achieve an in-depth understanding of how people perceive AI teammates and what they expect from AI teammates in human-AI teaming, we conducted a survey with 213 participants and a follow-up interview with 20 participants. Considering the context-dependency of teamwork, we chose to study human-AI teaming in the context of multiplayer online games as a case study. This study shows that people have mixed feelings toward AI teammates but hold a positive attitude toward future collaboration with AI teammates in general. Our findings highlight people's expectations for AI teammates in a rapidly changing collaborative environment (e.g., instrumental skills for in-game tasks, shared understanding between humans and AI, communication capabilities, human-like behaviors and performance), as well as factors that impact people's willingness to team up with AI teammates (e.g., pre-existing attitudes toward AI, previous collaboration experience with humans). We contribute to CSCW by shedding light on how AI should be structured in human-AI teaming to support highly complex collaborative activities in CSCW environments. Previous CSCW work generally focuses on human-collaboration and human-AI interaction, such as novel user interfaces [47] and using AI in daily work [60]. However, little work has studied humanAI teaming. In this paper, we presented results of a survey and semi-structured interviews to explore peopleâs perceptions of AI teammates in human-AI teaming, as well as how people expect AI to perform. We found that instrumental skill was the top priority in preferred AI characteristics, based on both survey and interview results. Following instrumental skills were preferences for shared understanding between humans and AI, communication capabilities, and human-like behavior and performance. We also investigated the factors impacting peopleâs willingness to team up with AI teammates. Both peopleâs previous collaboration experience with humans and pre-existing attitudes toward AI were significantly related with their willingness to be involved in human-AI teams. Additionally, we propose insights of human-AI teaming design for a better collaboration and coordination in human-AI teams. This work contributes to the CSCW literature by providing an in-depth understanding of peopleâs perceptions and expectations of AI teammates, as well as factors that impact peopleâs willingness to team up with AI teammates."
"Un Grano de Arena: Infrastructural Care, Social Media Platforms, and the Venezuelan Humanitarian Crisis",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432946,"Venezuela is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. In addition to food and medicinal shortages, violent crime has risen dramatically since 2014, spurring a mass exodus from the country. In order to cope with persistent material, informational, and digital infrastructural breakdowns that their friends and family in Venezuela are facing, members of the Venezuelan diaspora have turned to social media platforms to support people they left behind. Through semi-structured interviews and participant observation, I uncover the ways participants form a critical infrastructure for people in Venezuela. I describe participants' actions as infrastructural care --- infrastructural action as a form of caring for others at a distance through the ongoing management of resources, relationships, and infrastructures. Infrastructural care consists of relational, negotiated, and dialectic actions that provide critical support while also generating ongoing tensions as participants are geographically separated from the crisis and, through their involvement, are forced to confront their own experiences of trauma. In addition to proposing the lens of infrastructural care, this paper contributes to our understandings of the ways people cope with an ongoing humanitarian crisis at a distance and how social media platforms fit in with wider ecologies of efforts. This paper documents how members of the Venezuelan diaspora confront an ongoing crisis in their country of origin through infrastructural care (IC), defined as infrastructural action as a form of caring for others at a distance through the ongoing management of resources, relationships, and infrastructures. IC serves as a form of unidirectional care as participants, who are removed from the center of a crisis, continually act on behalf of those directly experiencing a crisis. While IC serves as a means of exhibiting and reclaiming agency, it is also stressful and draining as people must negotiate between various forms of distance, closeness, visibility, and emotional tolls. The sociotechnical phenomena of prolonged crisis are not fully visible in either acute crises or periods of privileged normalcy. For marginalized groups within Western society and around the world, contending with ongoing breakdowns and crisis is a daily reality. While it is important to continually question how sociotechnical designs can better facilitate peopleâs efforts, we cannot forget that the actions of people and the connections between them will always be required to work within and across the gaps of multiple sociotechnical systems. Rising global challenges and inequities demand our field adapt to situations of ongoing crisis more adeptly, recognizing the people at the center and peripheries of crisis and the ongoing IC work demanded of them."
"""I can't get round"": Recruiting Assistance in Mobile Robotic Telepresence",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432947,"Via audiovisual communications and a controllable physical embodiment, Mobile Robotic telePresence (MRP) systems aim to support enhanced collaboration between remote and local members of a given setting. But MRP systems also put the remote user in positions where they frequently rely on the help of local partners. Getting or 'recruiting' such help can be done with various verbal and embodied actions ranging in explicitness. In this paper, we look at how such recruitment occurs in video data drawn from an experiment where pairs of participants (one local, one remote) performed a timed searching task. We find a prevalence of implicit recruitment methods and outline obstacles to effective recruitment that emerge due to communicative asymmetries that are built into MRP design. In a future where remote work becomes widespread, assistance through remote work technology like MRPs needs close examination at a fundamental interactional level, taking into account how communicative asymmetries are at play in everyday use of such technologies. In this work we have closely examined the interaction between local and remote MRP-piloting participants working together in a collaborative search task, focusing on just how remote users recruit assistance from local participants. Drawing on Kendrick and Drewâs framework of assistance recruitment in face-to-face settings, our explication of MRP-mediated assistance recruitment draws attention to the interactional asymmetries in mobility, perception and intersubjectivity that participants face. Studies like ours that examine how assistance recruitment is achieved can reveal underlying nuances of the situation. For instance, are people comfortable asking for help, do they feel entitled to it? Do local colleagues feel responsible to help? Unpacking these processes can also highlight what barriers exist that make communication harder. A focus on understanding what communicative asymmetries exist can also allow us to asses not only what kind of help might be required but also how easily it can be recruited. As remote working becomes more common, it will be essential to ensure that remote workers using MRPs are able to effectively recruit the assistance they need. In so doing, we need to be mindful that requesting help and receiving assistance may create imbalances in organisational structure. Beyond the immediate issues that remote users face in assistance recruitment, questions of who âhas toâ work in the workplace versus who âgets toâ work from home and what that means to recruiting help etc. ought to be considered in terms of how they may entrench structural inequalities. Thus, a wider sense of a range of âre-balancings â may become relevant in the post-pandemic world of work. For instance, care should be taken, not only to ensure that remote workers can receive help, but also that doing so does not harm their position and how they are perceived in their workplace. To conclude with a more concrete take-away message for the CSCW design and research community, we feel that there is scope for wide-ranging changes to reduce the impact of asymmetries for MRP users. These may range from improved features in the MRP, to providing information not just to remote users but to those local to the MRP to raise awareness of inequality issues, to campaigns on etiquette to inform the community, to developing tutorials for workarounds to alleviate the impact of asymmetries, to guidelines for considerate and responsible conduct around MRPs. The CSCW community is well-placed to conduct research to understand how to alleviate some of these problems arising from asymmetries, reducing imbalances and making it easier for remote users to request and receive help."
Misinformation as a Window into Prejudice: COVID-19 and the Information Environment in India,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432948,"In the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis, there has been a massive amount of misinformation both related to the condition, and a range of linked social and economic issues. We present a mixed methods study of misinformation debunked by Indian fact checking agencies since January 2020. Alongside this, we present an analysis of what politicians in India have been discussing in the overlapping period. We find that affective issues dominate misinformation, especially in the period following the lockdown in India. Furthermore, we find that communal prejudice emerges as a central part of the misinformation environment, something that is reflected in the political speech around the same period. Researching misinformation when one is part of the cultural context can be a source of constant triggers, since oneâs own identity is enmeshed in the misinformation discourse and what it represents. This work was often difficult for some of us, dealing with our own identities as targets of vicious misinformation. This is distressing both for the graphic content and its impact at the moment of engagement, but also because many artifacts are indiciative of how some of our fellow citizens may see us. There is much conversation right now on machine learning and fairness, as well as on the information environments it creates and recreates. While a large amount of contemporary work on misinformation is automated or semi-supervised, our work shows that misinformation is powered by innuendo, and its true impact is understood as part of the larger social environment it inhabits. Here, the value of human annotation in getting at the deeper meaning of what is being said is critical. The ecosystem of hate that has been weaponized in India exists elsewhere in the world as well. The principal takeaway from our paper is that when the dominant or populist public discourse creates public enemies, in the form of certain populations or ideas, as inimical to the common good. These become the âusual suspectsâ for sensemaking in any crisis. There no doubt are malicious agents trying to actively pin a crisis on such an enemy, and social media allows for this through organized trolling or campaigning. But as we see through the trends in affective and instrumental misinformation in this work, a point of equally important concern is the muddied information environment itself, and how citizens seeking to cope may be habituated to turn to rumors and hate speech at these moments."
"Watched, but Moving: Platformization of Beauty Work and Its Gendered Mechanisms of Control",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432949,"Women gig workers face unique challenges in on-demand platforms as gendered aspects of class, caste, and labor participation intersect with moments of control experienced on the job. Through in-depth interviews with 19 beauty workers on on-demand home service platforms, we explore how the platformization of informal beauty work in India has ruptured dominant socio-cultural structures of control that have traditionally shaped women's mobility and access to work. This paper maps the ways in which women beauty gig workers experience and are impacted by algorithmic and bureaucratic management practices prevalent in the gig economy, in the context of home service platforms in Bangalore. We find that platform control impacts lives in myriad ways, beyond the conditions of work. Women workers negotiate their identities and sense of agency through the visibility afforded by platform control mechanisms. Yet, despite these subversions, being on a platform does not fundamentally change the socio-cultural logic that restricts women's lives in India. These mechanisms work to entrench power asymmetries between customers and workers, as well as maintain them between the platform and the worker. This work shows how women service workers in India are under constant scrutiny from multiple sources. A range of social actors, from their families and communities, to employers and customers, monitor and discipline their bodies, behaviour, and actions. This study explores how the platformization of beauty services through the emergence of home service apps reconfigures women beauty workersâ experiences of control with not only the platform, but with other social structures as well. We document and unpack how women beauty gig workers identify and make sense of moments of control experienced on the job. But we also show how workers have agency, and that they actively leverage platform control functions to negotiate modes of familial and customer control. In this, our work pushes the limits of critical questions that will occupy us in examining the changing world of work. Platforms, even if built in a universalizing mode to behave the same for workers around the world, cannot be studied in isolation from the gendered, cultural, and class realities of the settings where they are used."
ShiSha: Enabling Shared Perspective With Face-to-Face Collaboration Using Redirected Avatars in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432950,"The importance of remote collaboration grows in an interconnected world as the reasons to avoid travel increase. The spatial rendering and collaboration capabilities of virtual and augmented reality systems are well suited for tasks such as support or training. Users can take a shared perspective to build a common understanding. Also, users may engage in face-to-face cooperation to support interpersonal communication. However, a shared perspective and face-to-face collaboration are both desirable but naturally exclude each other. We place all users at the same location to provide a shared perspective. To avoid overlapping body parts, the avatars of the other connected users are shifted to the side. A redirected body pose modification corrects the resulting inconsistencies. The implemented system is compared to a baseline of two users standing in the same location and working with overlapping avatars. The results of a user study show that the proposed modifications provide an easy to use, efficient collaboration and yield higher co-presence and the feeling of teamwork. Applying redirection techniques to other users opens up novel ways to increase social presence for local or remote collaboration. We present ShiSha, a social redirection technique that allows multi-user collaboration from a shared perspective while at the same time providing a face-to-face interaction by shifting and modifying remote usersâ avatars. Taking the same perspective as another user leads to overlapping avatars. This breaks personal space boundaries and induces feelings of loneliness or surveillance as user feedback highlights. With ShiSha, avatar overlap is avoided as other avatars are shifted outside of the userâs own body. To compensate for the shift, the other avatars are modified to still reach to and look at the correct locations. A user study confirms that the ShiSha modification is easy to use and has an equal performance when compared to a user collaboration with a shared perspective and overlapping avatars. Co-presence scores and user commentary indicate that the face-to-face interaction of ShiSha conveys the feeling of teamwork and allows to follow the actions of the respective other. The social redirection of ShiSha is especially helpful in the context of remote training or support but is generally applicable for virtual conferences and user guidance. Our results indicate that although high fidelity user avatars might not be required for task execution, they benefit teamwork and contribute to a natural and comfortable conversation. Future work will build on the validated benefits of a shared perspective with face-to-face interaction. We aim to increase the feeling of co-presence and avatar realism and re-evaluate the benefits of ShiSha. To achieve this, we want to increase the behavioral realism of the redirected avatars, e.g. using neural networks to synthesize movements [95] and provide a personalized avatar with facial expressions and eye gaze for additional feedback cues and comfortable communication. Furthermore, we want to explore and extend the concept of social redirection, including VR-AR collaboration, three users or more, and other use cases (e.g. a more open brainstorming or design session)."
"For You, or For""You""?: Everyday LGBTQ+ Encounters with TikTok",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432951,"Online communities provide spaces for people who are vulnerable and underserved to seek support and build community, such as LGBTQ+ people. Today, some online community spaces are mediated by algorithms. Scholarship has found that algorithms have become deeply embedded in the systems that mediate our routine engagements with the world. Yet, little is known about how these systems impact those who are most vulnerable in society. In this paper, we focus on people's everyday experiences with one algorithmic system, the short video sharing application TikTok. TikTok recently received press that it was suppressing and oppressing the identities of its growing LGBTQ+ user population through algorithmic and human moderation of LGBTQ+ creators and content related to LGBTQ+ identity. Through an interview study with 16 LGBTQ+ TikTok users, we explore people's everyday engagements and encounters with the platform. We find that TikTok's For You Page algorithm constructs contradictory identity spaces that at once support LGBTQ+ identity work and reaffirm LGBTQ+ identity, while also transgressing and violating the identities of individual users. We also find that people are developing self-organized practices in response to these transgressions and violations. We discuss the implications of algorithmic systems on people's identity work, and introduce the concept of algorithmic exclusion, and explore how people are building resilience following moments of algorithmic exclusion. Our study presents a nuanced account of peopleâs everyday experiences with the algorithmic system TikTok. We found that TikTokâs For You Page algorithm constructs contradictory identity spaces that are both supportive and also exclusionary. There is still a lot of work left to be done. For example, potential avenues for future work could examine content creators more closely, to gain a better understanding of their resilience strategies in the face of disruption. This work may address the content producing and identity routines of both human and technical actors on TikTok, future work may also address the impact of stereotypes on LGBTQ+ visibility, such as the harms that these stereotypes may cause, or the tendency of normative stereotypes to reduce the visibility of non-normative gender identities and sexualities. Because sociotechnical systems are constructed and reconstructed by the social and cultural norms of society, the continued study of peopleâs day to day experiences with such systems provides fruitful insight into the functions of these systems, as well as how they structure and restructure these societal norms."
Understanding Women's Remote Collaborative Programming Experiences: The Relationship between Dialogue Features and Reported Perceptions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432952,"In recent years, remote collaboration has become increasingly common both in the workplace and in the classroom. It is imperative that we understand and support remote collaborative problem solving, particularly understanding the experiences of people from historically marginalized groups whose intellectual contributions are essential for addressing the pressing needs society faces. This paper reports on a study in which 58 introductory computer science students constructed code remotely with a partner following either predefined structured roles (driver and navigator in pair programming) or without predefined structured roles. Between the structured-role and unstructured-role conditions, participants? normalized learning gain, Intrinsic Motivation Inventory scores, and system usability scores were not significantly different. However, regardless of the collaboration condition, women reported significantly higher levels of stress, lower levels of perceived competence, and less perceived choice compared to men. Because computer science is a context in which women have been historically marginalized, we next examined the relationship between student gender and collaborative dialogues by extracting lexical and sentiment features from the textual messages partners exchanged. Results reveal that dialogue features, such as number of utterances, utterance length, and partner sentiment, significantly correlated with women's reports of stress, perceived competence, or perceived choice. These findings provide insight on women's experiences in remote programming, suggest that dialogue features can predict their collaborative experiences, and hold implications for designing systems that help provide collaborative experiences in which everyone can thrive. Remote collaboration has become increasingly common in industry and educational settings, with online courses and work becoming more prevalent due to growing technological capabilities. Remote collaborations have unique characteristics and nuances from those of co-located collaborations, and to better support these endeavors we must understand how people experience and perceive their remote collaborations. It is important to consider how individual characteristics may impact these experiences and perceptions, especially to understand and support historically marginalized groups. In this study, we investigated the influence of collaborative paradigms on remote collaborative problem solving in the context of computer science, a field in which women have been historically marginalized. Specifically, participants from a university computer science course coded in pairs, following either structured or unstructured collaborative roles, and we measured outcomes of normalized learning gain, intrinsic motivation, and system usability scores. There were no significant differences between the two collaboration conditions. Our analysis with respect to gender identity uncovered differences in menâs and womenâs experiences of the activity altogether, regardless of the collaboration condition. We found that womenâs perceptions of their experiences differed significantly from menâs in several aspects. Women on average reported more stress, less perceived competence in their computing abilities, and less perceived choice compared to men. These negative emotions may inhibit the comfort and success of women in the computer science field, and should be researched more extensively to best promote desirable interactions between collaborators and support women during remote collaborative programming. In that vein, we inspected womenâs collaborative dialogues to gain more insight into their experiences, and our analyses revealed five important relationships between dialogue features and womenâs outcomes: (1) womenâs number of sent messages was positively correlated with their reported relaxation and competence; (2) womenâs average words per message was positively correlated with their reported competence and choice; (3) womenâs number of received messages was negatively correlated with their reported competence and choice; (4) the average words per message in womenâs received messages was positively correlated with their reported relaxation; and (5) the average compound sentiment of the womenâs received messages was positively correlated with their reported relaxation, competence, and choice. These findings hold important implications for the CSCW community and for future work. For example, our study did not find a significant correlation between womenâs own average compound sentiment and any of their outcomes. This result suggests that despite reporting lower levels of relaxation, perceived competence, and perceived choice, women may not have expressed these emotions and perceptions in their written messages. Future work should delve deeper into the pragmatic and semantic structure of the dialogues, as this investigation may provide insight into the ways in which women are expressing themselves through their dialogue and problem-solving approaches. Additionally, more research is needed to understand the structures and affordances that support all users during remote collaborative problem solving."
"3 Stars on Yelp, 4 Stars on Google Maps: A Cross-Platform Examination of Restaurant Ratings",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432953,"Even though a restaurant may receive different ratings across review platforms, people often see only one rating during a local search (e.g. 'best burgers near me'). In this paper, we examine the differences in ratings between two commonly used review platforms-Google Maps and Yelp. We found that restaurant ratings on Google Maps are, on average, 0.7 stars higher than those on Yelp, with the increase being driven in large part by higher ratings for chain restaurants on Google Maps. We also found extensive diversity iÂ¬Â¬n top-ranked restaurants by geographic region across platforms. For example, for a given metropolitan area, there exists little overlap in its top ten lists of restaurants on Google Maps and Yelp. Our results problematize the use of a single review platform in local search and have implications for end users of ratings and local search technologies. We outline concrete design recommendations to improve communication of restaurant evaluation and discuss the potential causes for the divergence we observed. Examining the two most popular restaurant review platforms in the U.S., Google Maps and Yelp, we found that restaurant ratings on Google Maps are, on average, 0.7 stars higher than those on Yelp. We observed that this increase is larger among chain restaurants than independent restaurants. Additionally, we found extensive diversity in the top-ranked restaurants for a given metropolitan area between Google Maps and Yelp. Our study problematizes the use of a single, primary review platform as a source for ratings in local search technologies and point to corresponding design recommendations."
Towards Building Community Collective Efficacy for Managing Digital Privacy and Security within Older Adult Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432954,"Older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. To date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. Instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. To do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. Community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. Using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. Our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security. In this paper, we have examined the capacity of older adults to support each other in digital privacy and security management through the exploration of community collective efficacy. Our results highlight several factors that support community collective efficacy for privacy and security, namely individual self-efficacy for privacy and security, power usage of technology, and a sense of community belonging. Overall, our results indicate that each of the constructs examined plays a vital role in supporting community collective efficacy for privacy and security and warrants future work to understand other factors that may help communities that have low self-efficacy for privacy and security and low technology usage. One important contribution from this study is the important role that community facilitators can play in providing technical expertise in these communities, as we observed with the employees in the residential community. Based on our findings, we believe our framework for building community collective efficacy may be useful to investigate individual- and community-based impacts when implementing privacy and security interventions. In addition, our social network analysis approach can aid in the examination of the socio-technical environment that may be critical to the success of such interventions, allowing researchers to focus on participantâs relationships with others in their community. We contribute our work as an extension of the discussion on social cybersecurity and community oversight for privacy and security."
Data Integration as Coordination: The Articulation of Data Work in an Ocean Science Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432955,"Recent CSCW research on the collaborative design and development of research infrastructures for the natural sciences has increasingly focused on the challenges of open data sharing. This qualitative study describes and analyzes how multidisciplinary, geographically distributed ocean scientists are integrating highly diverse data as part of an effort to develop a new research infrastructure to advance science. This paper identifies different kinds of coordination that are necessary to align processes of data collection, production, and analysis. Some of the hard work to integrate data is undertaken before data integration can even become a technical problem. After data integration becomes a technical problem, social and organizational means continue to be critical for resolving differences in assumptions, methods, practices, and priorities. This work calls attention to the diversity of coordinative, social, and organizational practices and concerns that are needed to integrate data and also how, in highly innovative work, the process of integrating data also helps to define scientific problem spaces themselves. This paper has investigated scientistsâ everyday activities in navigating the various concerns of data integration. Stakeholders experience a large number of intersecting concerns emerging from their disciplinary, mutual familiarity, and methodological, differences. Researchers work to bring their data collecting, cleaning, and sharing efforts into alignment with downstream situations of reuse. In this process we highlight the various kinds of articulation work which must go on in order to construct lines and arcs of work for the efficient movement of data between situations, to match workers to tasks, and to bring essential resources into the relevant work site. We outline a number of ways in which a practice-based approach shifts our attention in the study of data integration, and, more broadly, of data sharing and reuse. Firstly, it refocuses our attention towards the practices that researchers enact on the ground in order to navigate this complexity. Secondly, it highlights the work researchers engage in to figure out how to integrate data, and not only their considerations of whether or when to integrate data. This moves us beyond a simple barriers/incentives model, and casts the problem of exchanging data in the sciences not as a system of walls that need to be knocked down, but a system of bridges that might be built. For the designer of data portals and other data sharing systems, this might mean moving away from large, top-down standardization efforts, and towards a situated design effort. This would involve looking for sites of collaborative practice where interoperations between data types, methods, and ways of working are already being hashed out for particular ends by researchers and widening these paths, rather than examining why data sharing is not happening in a given situation. Finally, examining articulation work draws our attention to the processes by which new roles and divisions of labor emerge around the project of data integration between newly collaborating fields or methodological communities."
Content Creation in Later Life: Reconsidering Older Adults' Digital Participation and Inclusion,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434166,"In increasingly digitalised societies, government initiatives to ensure that public services remain accessible for everyone typically focus on the digital inclusion of older adults. However, by solely viewing older adults as passive recipients or consumers of services, digital inclusion strategies under-emphasise the concept of digital participation. Highlighting the importance of older adults as active contributors in a digital society, we investigated the potential of content creation to increase older adults' digital skills whilst also strengthening their digital participation. Through a workshop and interviews involving three different groups of older content producers, we show that content creation can stimulate older adults' digital participation. We report on challenges faced by the content creators, including time constraints, lack of professional support and the preference to create content collaboratively. We propose that by facilitating collaborative content creation activities, local communities can better support older adults' digital participation and facilitate inclusion across different life domains. This research presented here explored the potential of using content creation as a pathway to enhanced digital skills in later life. It adds to key debates about civic participation in later life by focusing on participation in digital spaces to achieve civic goals. We show that by engaging in a range of content creation activities, such as radio production and online communications, older adults can engage more widely with digital technologies and develop their digital skills. Digital content creation can also strengthen civic participation in later life and widen the reach of older peopleâs voices. Our research highlights the importance of recognising older adults as active contributors in the digital sphere. These insights have implications for the delivery of digital inclusion strategies, leading us to propose a shift towards digital participation in later life as a means of supporting older adults to become more active in civic society. Despite these promising examples of how digital skill development can happen through content creation, there is ample scope for future work to address this topic in greater depth. In particular, we need to consider contrasting examples, in which digital skills development might not arise from participation in content creation activities. Future research should continue to explore barriers to digital and civic participation of a diverse older population. There is also merit in exploring in more detail potential differences between various means of digital content creation activities, how they are used by older adults and in which ways they contribute to the development of digital skills in later life."
Online Community-based Design of Free and Open Source Software for Transgender Voice Training,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434167,"This paper describes Project Spectra, a collective of open source developers that aims to build free and open source voice training technology for transgender people. We demonstrate how a design prioritizing the agency of trans users was made possible through sustained community collaboration. Using an autoethnographic approach, we discuss our community-based design process, which was documented with memos, online meetings and text conversations, sketches, and other data sources. We illustrate how we articulated our values as a group: deciding our programming framework (including a Statement of Principles), elaborating our ""Experience Goals"" (the feelings we wanted our design to elicit), and determining the features we wanted to implement in our app. We conclude with a reflection on the benefits and challenges of conducting community-based design research through an open-source organizational model. Community-based collaborative design allowed Project Spectra members to work against dominant, agency-stripping gender norms. Prioritizing agency in our app from the beginning, we supported users specifying and changing their goals at any time. Within our organization, we intended to support membersâ agency by fostering meaningful (and not mandatory) participation based on our own skills, interests, and backgrounds. We sought feedback from individuals outside our group, such as speech therapy practitioners, and recognized that they possessed unique training. However, we also did not elevate their knowledge above and beyond that of the broader community, especially if they hailed from a clinical institution. That being said, our work as a group was not immune to contradictions arising from my position in academia. This paper attempted to answer calls within HCI for a âreorientingâ and ârestructuringâ of PD, but more research on alternative working models is still needed. Researchers can use established groupwork models â such as PD, FOSS, and CBPP â as methodological guides to design; we can then ask how we can (and should) work with others, and what design methods are appropriate in a given context. Evaluative questions guided by feminist methodologies can reveal the relationships, habits, stories, and breakdowns that structure our design projects. This paper showed the importance of reflecting, via autoethnographic field notes, on the researcherâs own positionality and influence on the research. Coleman [18] describes how open source software developers act collectively but reject âpolitics,â considering it a failed enterprise. Conversely, it seems, HCI researchers embrace political analyses and approaches but struggle to collectively challenge the oppressive systems that govern neoliberal academia. As a case in point, the academic context of this research, and my participation in it, sometimes benefited but ultimately hampered the extent to which our design process could embody a bottom-up and self-driven ideal. To address this issue, we must organize toward political, economic, and cultural shifts in the structure and governance of academic institutions."
Towards Supporting Programming Education at Scale via Live Streaming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434168,"Live streaming, which allows streamers to broadcast their work to live viewers, is an emerging practice for teaching and learning computer programming. Participation in live streaming is growing rapidly, despite several apparent challenges, such as a general lack of training in pedagogy among streamers and scarce signals about a stream's characteristics (e.g., difficulty, style, and usefulness) to help viewers decide what to watch. To understand why people choose to participate in live streaming for teaching or learning programming, and how they cope with both apparent and non-obvious challenges, we interviewed 14 streamers and viewers about their experience with live streaming programming. Among other results, we found that the casual and impromptu nature of live streaming makes it easier to prepare than pre-recorded videos, and viewers have the opportunity to shape the content and learning experience via real-time communication with both the streamer and each other. Nonetheless, we identified several challenges that limit the potential of live streaming as a learning medium. For example, streamers voiced privacy and harassment concerns, and existing streaming platforms do not adequately support viewer-streamer interactions, adaptive learning, and discovery and selection of streaming content. Based on these findings, we suggest specialized tools to facilitate knowledge sharing among people teaching and learning computer programming online, and we offer design recommendations that promote a healthy, safe, and engaging learning environment. In this research, we sought to understand the benefits and challenges of live streaming as a new way to share and acquire technical knowledge. In particular, we aimed to position live streaming in the ecosystem of online programming education by comparing it to traditional video-based learning experiences. Through in-depth interviews with 14 streamers and 12 viewers who regularly participate in programming-focused live streams, we identified the unique educational value live streaming provides due to its improvisational, real-time, and social nature. We found that these characteristics of live streaming not only lower the barrier to sharing knowledge but also allow the viewer to shape the content being taught while observing error recovery and workarounds they would otherwise miss in well-edited videos. Live streaming thus plays an important gap-filling role in the rather crowded space of online learning technologies. Nonetheless, our study also revealed a number of challenges users face in education-focused live streaming. In addition to a lack of features specifically designed to support learning in video live streaming platforms, streamers also have to deal with privacy risks and sometimes online harassment. Drawing from our findings, we suggest better tools and strategies for leveraging the benefits of live streaming and mitigating the drawbacks and risks of participation. We contribute a critical examination of this young practice to the HCI literature and several design directions to evolve live streaming platforms into safer, more effective, and more inclusive learning environments."
Looking for a Deal?: Visual Social Attention during Negotiations via Mixed Media Videoconferencing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434169,"Whereas social visual attention has been examined in computer-mediated (e.g., shared screen) or video-mediated (e.g., FaceTime) interaction, it has yet to be studied in mixed-media interfaces that combine video of the conversant along with other UI elements. We analyzed eye gaze of 37 dyads (74 participants) who were tasked with negotiating the price of a new car (as a buyer and seller) using mixed-media video conferencing under competitive or cooperative negotiation instructions (experimental manipulation). We used multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to extract spatio-temporal patterns corresponding to mutual gaze (individuals look at each other), joint attention (individuals focus on the same elements of the interface), and gaze aversion (an individual looks at their partner, who is looking elsewhere). Our results indicated that joint attention predicted the sum of points attained by the buyer and seller (i.e., the joint score). In contrast, gaze aversion was associated with faster time to complete the negotiation, but with a lower joint score. Unexpectedly, mutual gaze was highly infrequent and unrelated to the negotiation outcomes and none of the gaze patterns predicted subjective perceptions of the negotiation. There were also no effects of gender composition or negotiation condition on the gaze patterns or negotiation outcomes. Our results suggest that social visual attention may operate differently in mixed-media collaborative interfaces than in face-to-face interaction. As mixed-media collaborative interfaces gain prominence, our work can be leveraged to inform the design of gaze-sensitive user interfaces that support remote negotiations among other tasks. Collaborative mixed-media interfaces (e.g., Skype and Zoom) are ubiquitous in our daily lives, allowing us to instantly communicate and collaborate. Despite the technological advances, these interfaces are still imperfect and narrow the communicative bandwidth compared to face-to-face interactions and research on non-verbal communication with these interfaces is sparse. Here, we focused on social visual attention because of its instrumental role in effective collaboration by aiding coordination, communication, and signaling socio-emotional states. Since traditional measures (such as summary statistics) cannot capture temporal dynamics, of social visual attention, we utilized and enhanced a technique called multidimensional recurrent quantification analysis (MdRQA) to explore spatio-temporal dynamics of social visual attention. We found that social visual attention in remote interaction partly resembles characteristics of face-to-face interaction. Whereas joint attention and gaze aversion were two prominent patterns, mutual gaze was largely diminished. Contrary to some findings from face-to-face interaction, social visual attention in our study was not associated with factors, such as gender composition and negotiation orientation. However, social visual attention was a powerful predictor of objective negotiation outcomes. These findings broaden our understanding of social visual attention in remote interaction with modern mixed-media interfaces and provide guidance for the design of next-generation collaborative interfaces."
Divided We Stand: The Collaborative Work of Patients and Providers in an Enigmatic Chronic Disease,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434170,"In chronic conditions, patients and providers need support in understanding and managing illness over time. Focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. We found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and providers; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. We note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. Specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues. Our work elicited patientsâ and providersâ conceptualizations of their work in endometriosis care, on their own and as part of the patient-provider partnership. In comparing, contrasting, and synthesizing their stories, frustrations, and ideas, we confirmed that patients and providers are engaged in multiple arcs of work and their partnerships lay on shifting ground. Because of the enigmatic and chronic nature of endometriosis, these arcs of work are compounded by additional challenges, and the partnership is particularly vulnerable to potential misalignments and misinterpretations among actors. Our analysis uncovers such breaking points, and we propose a set of design implications to support patients and providers in their work in the context of an enigmatic chronic condition. Because of the complexity of this disease, technology should enable patients and providers to construct a holistic and flexible view of the patientâs illness experience, facilitate individual and collaborative reflection and sensemaking, and provide functionalities to structure trial-and-error care plans and for explicitly identifying and correcting misalignments."
Not Another Medication Adherence App: Critical Reflections on Addressing Public HIV-related Stigma Through Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434171,"People living with HIV experience a high level of stigma in our society. Public HIV-related stigma often leads to anxiety and depression and hinders access to social support and proper medical care. Technologies for HIV, however, have been mainly designed for treatment management and medication adherence rather than for helping people cope with public HIV-related stigma specifically. Drawing on empirical data obtained from semi-structured interviews and design activities with eight social workers and 29 people living with HIV, we unpack the ways in which needs for privacy and trust, intimacy, and social support create tensions around key coping strategies. Reflecting on these tensions, we present design implications and opportunities to empower people living with HIV to cope with public HIV-related stigma at the individual level. People living with HIV need and use medication adherence tools. However, there is still a lack tools that could help address the wide-ranging impacts of public HIV-related stigma on the HIV coping journey. Based on interviews and activities with people living with HIV and social workers, we identified several challenges and tensions that make coping with public HIV-related stigma particularly challenging. We also discussed possible design implications and directions for future research, including the co-creation of technologies that could be customized to address stigmarelated tensions more holistically. We urge researchers in the HCI and CSCW communities to design beyond medication adherence applications and existing online platforms as they seek to minimize the deleterious impact of stigma in peopleâs lives."
A Gameful Organizational Assimilation Process: Insights from World of Warcraft for Gamification Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434172,"A central process of virtual organization design relates to how newcomers are assimilated into organizational dynamics. Research on organizational assimilation has traditionally investigated 'serious' organizational contexts. Nonetheless, video games can offer insights on how such assimilation can be effectively supported. In this article, I propose to look at World of Warcraft (WoW) to understand how individuals can be successfully integrated into online organizations. Through an ethnographic research, made up of participant observation and 36 semi-structured interviews, I explore how specific game design elements support organizational assimilation into WoW raiding guilds. This shows how designers elicit extremely engaging organizational dynamics that encourage players to identify with their organizations. Based on these findings, I propose design considerations for gamifying virtual organizations that draw from the structure of WoW raiding guilds. The main contribution of this article is to outline how players are assimilated into WoWâs raiding guilds through the substitution of the playerâs schedules, spaces, and relations. The ethnographic research that I conducted shows the high effectiveness of WoW assimilation process, which leads players to strongly identify with the game organizations. The study findings also point out the major role that specific game design elements have in supporting the assimilation process, directly encouraging the establishment of common temporal orders, shared imaginaries, and networks of relationships. I called this kind of assimilation a âgameful organizational assimilationâ, being elicited by game design elements aimed at making the experience of assimilation gameful. As a practical implication of the research, I suggested that my study findings may offer insights for the gamification of virtual organizations that present similar characteristics to WoW raiding guilds. I hope that the findings recounted in this article could inspire different future strands of research, from both the empirical and theoretical points of view."
Speculative Data Work & Dashboards: Designing Alternative Data Visions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434173,"This paper studies data work in an organizational context, and suggests speculative data work as a useful concept and the speculative dashboard as a design concept, to better understand and support cooperative work. Drawing on fieldwork in a Danish public sector organisation, the paper identifies and conceptualizes the speculative data work performed around processes of digitalization and the push to become data-driven. The speculative dashboard is proposed as a design concept and opportunity for design, using practices from speculative design and research to facilitate speculation about data?its sources, visualizations, practices and infrastructures. It does so by hacking the 'genre' of the business intelligence data dashboard, and using it as a framework for the juxtaposition of different kinds of data, facilitating and encouraging speculation on alternative visions for data types and use. The paper contributes an empirical study of organizational use of and attitudes towards data, informing a novel design method and concept for co-speculating on alternative visions of and for organizational data. We conclude the paper by listing a number of questions and considerations which future work can orient itself on the basis of: - In the context of a speculative economy and hype around novel technologies, try to take an active decision as to how the project relates to these conditions. - Consider how speculation and hype might be used strategically as âluresâ or âperceptual bridgesâ towards design projects and interventions. - When encouraging speculation, be aware of existing sociotechnical imaginaries around data and data infrastructures. - Consider how such existing imaginaries may be disturbed, interfered with or remixed. - What might a âlureâ or âperceptual bridgeâ for alternative futures for public sector digitalization look like? The fieldwork that forms the basis of this paper empirically pointed to organizational data being a source of stress for public sector employees. This data was uncertain in quality and purpose, it was associated with cutbacks, and its contribution to central aspects of the work was unclear. Based on CSCW, HCI and STS literatures on speculation, the speculative dashboard has been developed as an intervention into the data infrastructures that support this perception of data. The speculative dashboard is intended as an exercise or design artefact which can help facilitate positive speculative data work: either as an exercise that can be done in groups or as part of a data infrastructure, connecting different parts of an organisation. It works by the juxtaposition of different types of data within a familiar visualization space, and also by creating different contexts of use focused more on collective discussion and deliberation. By drawing on speculative design and research practices, the paper has proposed the speculative dashboard as an object of speculation, but also for the promotion of a different kind of speculation. In a sense, this kind of speculation is akin to changing dashboards from devices that focus on matters of fact to things which are able to help in articulating matters of concern. We recognize that the paper might have taken on and engaged in co-design or participatory design together with the users who were present in the ethnographic study, but the goal of the paper has been not to co-create but instead to attempt to think up infrastructures that might help others co-speculate. We suggest participatory design to be a very valuable area for future research on the topic of speculation and data economies."
Understanding and Predicting the Burst of Burnout via Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434174,"Job burnout is a special type of work-related stress that is prevalent in our modern society, and constant burnout is extremely harmful for people's physical health and emotional wellbeing. Traditional studies for burnout mainly rely on surveys/questionnaires, which have revealed several interesting findings but are of high cost and very time consuming. With the prevalence of social networking applications, we aim to re-investigate the burnout phenomenon in a novel perspective. In this paper, we collected a dataset consisting of 1532 burnout Weibo users with their postings. Based on the previous literature, we propose a number of hypotheses about what might be the burst signal of the burnout from the perspective of language, time and interaction. Furthermore, extensive correlation analysis is conducted to investigate if these hypotheses are supported, which leads to a number of interesting findings. Finally, we develop machine learning models to predict the burst of burnout based on extracted features and achieve a relatively high accuracy, which reveals potential implications in early-stage intervention. In this paper, we collect a number of users with job burnout firstly. Then based on previous studies, we put forward some reasonable hypotheses associated with burnout and posting behaviors from three perspectives: language, time and interaction. Furthermore, we extract dependent variables corresponding to hypotheses, and make the significance tests of these variables in the way of T-test and Chi-squared test, thus we draw conclusions about which hypotheses are reliable. In the process of analysis work, we discover some valuable findings, which provides us a comprehensive understanding of job burnout from the view of social media . Finally, we design models to predict whether user would get burnout next. Our prediction experiments support our analysis conclusions and have a good performance of detecting the burnout burst with the recall score of 0.9467, the precision score of 0.6652 and F1 score of 0.7813."
CrowdMOT: Crowdsourcing Strategies for Tracking Multiple Objects in Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434175,"Crowdsourcing is a valuable approach for tracking objects in videos in a more scalable manner than possible with domain experts. However, existing frameworks do not produce high quality results with non-expert crowdworkers, especially for scenarios where objects split. To address this shortcoming, we introduce a crowdsourcing platform called CrowdMOT, and investigate two micro-task design decisions: (1) whether to decompose the task so that each worker is in charge of annotating all objects in a sub-segment of the video versus annotating a single object across the entire video, and (2) whether to show annotations from previous workers to the next individuals working on the task. We conduct experiments on a diversity of videos which show both familiar objects (aka - people) and unfamiliar objects (aka - cells). Our results highlight strategies for efficiently collecting higher quality annotations than observed when using strategies employed by today's state-of-art crowdsourcing system. We introduce a general-purpose crowdsourcing system for multiple object tracking that also supports lineage tracking. Our experiments demonstrate significant flaws in the existing stateof-the-art crowdsourcing task design. We quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of two key micro-task design options in collecting much higher quality video annotations: (1) have a single worker annotate a single object for the entire video and (2) show workers the results of previously annotated objects on the video. To encourage further development and extension of our framework, we will publicly share our code."
School's Back: Scaffolding Reminiscence in Social Virtual Reality with Older Adults,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434176,"Social virtual reality (social VR) is an emerging technology that has the potential to support unique social experiences for groups of older adults. In this paper we explore the use of social VR to support group reminiscence, an activity that has been shown to have a positive impact on the lives of older adults. We developed School Days, a bespoke social VR application that enables groups of geographically dispersed older adults to meet in a virtual environment to reminisce about their school experiences. We conducted a user study over the course of 5 months with 16 participants aged 70--81 to evaluate how School Days supported reminiscence. In this paper, we focus on how the use of reminiscence scaffolding features in School Days impacted on the older adults' ability to participate more fully in the reminiscence activities. Our results illustrate the value of social VR for connecting older adults over distance, and contribute new knowledge of how virtual environments can be designed to scaffold reminiscence; how techniques such as 3D conversation starters and individual artefacts can be used to scaffold reminiscence; and how pre-recorded holographic stories (Avacasts) can be used to introduce new perspectives and prompt self-reflection. We contribute five design reflections aimed at guiding the design of future reminiscence tools in social VR. In this paper we explored the potential for social VR to support reminiscence among older adults. We implemented School Days, a social VR prototype that includes scaffolding techniques to support social reminiscence. In an evaluation with 16 older adults, we found that the design of the virtual classroom environment acted as a prompt to stimulate memories while allowing participants to project their own experiences onto it. In addition, our scaffolding techniques of conversation starters, personal artefacts and Avacast holograms contributed to powerful experiences of social reminiscence and self-reflection for the older adults. Based on the results of our empirical research, we contribute five design reflections that can inform future HCI work on social VR based reminiscence applications aimed at older users. Overall, our study stresses the potential for social VR to enable novel experiences for older adults as a contribution to healthy ageing."
