The Perpetual Work Life of Crowdworkers: How Tooling Practices Increase Fragmentation in Crowdwork,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359126,"Crowdworkers regularly support their work with scripts, extensions, and software to enhance their productivity. Despite their evident significance, little is understood regarding how these tools affect crowdworkers' quality of life and work. In this study, we report findings from an interview study (N=21) aimed at exploring the tooling practices used by full-time crowdworkers on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our interview data suggests that the tooling utilized by crowdworkers (1) strongly contributes to the fragmentation of microwork by enabling task switching and multitasking behavior; (2) promotes the fragmentation of crowdworkers' work-life boundaries by relying on tooling that encourages a 'work-anywhere' attitude; and (3) aids the fragmentation of social ties within worker communities through limited tooling access. Our findings have implications for building systems that unify crowdworkers' work practice in support of their productivity and well-being. In this paper, we reported ndings from an interview study aimed at exploring the tooling practicesemployed in full-time crowdwork. Our findings suggest that the tooling utilized by crowdworkers (1)strongly contributes to the fragmentation of microwork by enabling task switching and multitaskingbehavior; (2) promotes the fragmentation of crowdworkers’ work-life boundaries by relying ontooling that encourages a ‘work-anywhere’ attitude; and (3) aids the fragmentation of social tieswithin worker communities through limited tooling access. We concluded our paper by discussingthe implications of our findings in the context of engineering and studying tools that meaningfullyimpact the productivity and well-being of the crowdworker community."
Vicariously Experiencing it all Without Going Outside: A Study of Outdoor Livestreaming in China,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359127,"The livestreaming industry in China is gaining greater traction than its European and North American counterparts and has a profound impact on the stakeholders' online and offline lives. An emerging genre of livestreaming that has become increasingly popular in China is outdoor livestreaming. With outdoor livestreams, streamers broadcast outdoor activities, travel, or socialize with passersby in outdoor settings, often for 6 or more hours, and viewers watch such streams for hours each day. However, given that professionally produced content about travel and outdoor activities are not very popular, it is currently unknown what makes this category of livestreams so engaging and how these techniques can be applied to other content or genres. Thus, we conducted a mixed methods study consisting of a survey (N=287) and interviews (N = 20) to understand how viewers watch and engage with outdoor livestreams in China. The data revealed that outdoor livestreams encompass many categories of content, environments and passersby behaviors create challenges and uncertainty for viewers and streamers, and viewers watch livestreams for surprising lengths of time (e.g., sometimes more than 5 continuous hours). We also gained insights into how live commenting and virtual gifting encourage engagement. Lastly, we detail how the behaviors of dedicated fans and casual viewers differ and provide implications for the design of livestreaming services that support outdoor activities. This work examined viewers’ experiences when watching outdoor livestreams and engaging with outdoor livestreamers’ communities within the context of China. The results from the survey and interviews revealed that a diverse range of outdoor activities are streamed on popular livestreaming platforms in China and that different categories of outdoor livestreams engage different segments of the viewing audience (i.e., dedicated, casual, and light viewers). Dedicated viewers watch an outdoor livestream for excessive periods of time in one sitting (e.g., 5 hours), and are vicariously engaged with streamers’ content and communities, while casual and light viewers are less engaged, and watched more for information and personal fulfilment. We also found that, for dedicated viewers, Danmaku is used to create a concurrent side show during a livestream, and it can sometimes be more engaging than the livestream itself. Gifting behaviors were also found to be deeply rooted in the Chinese cultural element of “paimian”. By identifying unique challenges that viewers and streamers encounter within the realm of outdoor livestreaming, e.g., contextual unpredictability and privacy concerns, the results of this work should help improve the design of livestreaming platforms and enable the community to better understand the influence and effects of such livestreaming content on viewing audiences, both inside and outside of China."
Customizations and Expression Breakdowns in Ecosystems of Communication Apps,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359128,"The growing adoption of emojis, stickers and GIFs suggests a corresponding demand for rich, personalized expression in messaging apps. Some people customize apps to enable more personal forms of expression, yet we know little about how such customizations shape everyday communication. Since people increasingly communicate via multiple apps side-by-side, we are also interested in how customizing one app influences communication via other apps. We created a taxonomy of customization options based on interviews with 15 ""extreme users"" of communication apps. We found that participants tailored their apps to express their identities, organizational culture, and intimate bonds with others. They also experienced expression breakdowns: frustrations around barriers to transferring personal forms of expression across apps, which inspired inventive workarounds to maintain cross-app habits of expression, such as briefly switching apps to generate and export content for a particular conversation. We conclude with implications for personalized expression in ecosystems of communication apps. We studied customization practices in ecosystems of communication apps to understand the value of customizations in the context of CMC and to gather insights that inform novel designs for increased personalization of mobile communication. Through interviews with 15 “extreme users” of communication apps, we collected stories about 22 customization options across nine different apps (e.g., changing the color of chat bubbles in Messenger). We created a taxonomy of customization options in mobile communication apps, which we used to characterize the reported customizations according to their Visibility (whether their results are visible to others or not), Ownership (whether they can be controlled by the user or by other contacts as well) and Scope (whether they affect a single conversation, a whole app , or any conversation throughout the ecosystem of apps). We found that participants tailored their apps to better express their identities, their organizational culture, and their intimate bonds with others. Participants relied on customization options (e.g., chatbots, custom-made stickers) and means of expression (e.g., emojis, reactions) of particular apps to shape personal forms of expression, which they tried transferring to other apps for maintaining consistent expressions of their identities and bonds with others. However, this was often not possible, leading to expression breakdowns: frustrated attempts to transferring personal forms of expression between apps, mainly due to app-exclusive customization options, customization options with different designs across apps, and app-exclusive means of expression that, despite not being customizable, helped establishing personal forms of expression. To overcome these breakdowns, participants looked for alternative forms of expression within the current app, moved a conversation to the app that best suited their expression needs, or temporarily switched to other apps to generate and export the content they needed for a conversation. We contribute: 1) a taxonomy of customization options in mobile communication apps that serves as an analytic lens for understanding the role of a customization option in interpersonal communication, as well as a design space for exploring novel opportunities for design; 2) insight into the value of customizations as means for maintaining relationships online; 3) insight into “expression breakdowns” and the transfer of habits of expression between apps; 4) implications for designing new customization opportunities for supporting richer expressions of identity and intimacy within close relationships in ecosystems of communication apps."
Orienting to Networked Grief: Situated Perspectives of Communal Mourning on Facebook,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359129,"Contemporary American experiences of death and mourning increasingly extend onto social network sites, where friends gather to memorialize the deceased. That ""everyone grieves in their own way'' may be true, but it forecloses important questions about how people evaluate these expressions, their relationship to others who are grieving, and impacts on their own experiences of grief. Drawing from mixed-methods research conducted over five years, we describe how individuals position themselves within and evaluate expressions of networked grief. We start by identifying five orientations -- reinforcing, supporting, transferring, objecting, and isolating -- that describe how individuals evaluate actions of grievers, position themselves relative to the network, and act when they encounter grief. We then describe factors and tensions that influence how individuals arrive at these orientations. Based on our findings, we argue that the design of social media can be sensitized to diverse needs by adopting a situated perspective within a dynamic post-mortem network. Death and its associated grief on SNSs provide an extreme case in which individuals encounter and make sense of emotional content in networked spaces. SNSs are optimized for connecting with others and sharing experiences and though they appear dynamic are actually quite brittle in how they encode these contexts and relationships. Gathering with others who are also grieving in online spaces can be a key way to receive support while also reinforcing one’s connection with the deceased [23]. However, even as SNSs facilitate communal experiences of mourning [50], people are variable in how much they can or choose to participate in or even be exposed to the grief of others in these spaces. Some may benefit from communal expressions of grief, but for others the individualized nature of grief [51] may result in a desire to limit their interactions with the broadly public spaces afforded by SNSs. Rather than defaulting to the simple truism that “everyone grieves differently,” the analysis we present describes how people judge and navigate the actions of others as they develop their own orientation to instances of networked grief. In so doing, our model gives insight into how networks “happen.” Even as individuals make sense of their relationships to others, their actions serve to initiate, shift, calcify, and erode their relationships to these networks [1]. Ultimately, individuals do not simply sign in to Facebook to express their grief. The networks that happen around individuals as they express their emotions act to construct their grief. Orientations describe how individuals negotiate their own needs in relationship to a broader network. Public spaces for grief are not simply supportive environments where those who are grieving can gather. Nor are they just sites that open people up to new risks. They are dynamic spaces that are best understood from individuals’ perspectives and their place within a network. The diversity of orientations we shared may help to complicate simple or idealized assumptions about the experience and expression of grief in networked settings. People change how they orient to grief and to the expressions of it over time and as context changes. While we have identified five key orienting forms in our data, additional orientations could likely emerge given different contexts — both technological and not. Large social network sites like Facebook would benefit from directing their efforts on the steps we outlined in our model that highlight points of inflection that give rise to orientations. Large-scale data science, focused on identifying markers for the milestones we have outlined through which people orient, could help identify orientations that exist within a specific platform, as well as possible tensions between different orientations. Likewise, while designers should explore ways to accommodate specific orientations in their systems, they should also consider how people might pivot rapidly among these. While challenging, designers can shape the orientations that emerge by addressing the factors we have identified here. As first steps, we suggest that designers focus on what expressions of grief an individual encounters (Encounter, in our model) and what contextual information is available as an individual evaluates these expressions (Situate). This work demonstrates how people come to produce various orientations to grieving networks on Facebook. An individual’s orientation can change in relationship to an evolving network of grievers, and is contingent on their understanding of the nature and composition of the network, how it is changing, behavioral norms, and expressions of grief. However, by exploring how people adopt an orientation to an evolving network, our analysis sheds light on broader questions of sociality on SNSs. The work presented in this paper is thus relevant to innumerable instances in which a person is struck by a post on an SNS — whether it be distressing, funny, or bombastic. Future work may benefit from examining how the factors we describe in our model function in other social spaces, in reaction to other categories of posts, and in service of other emotions. Such research would enrich our understanding of the various orientations that are produced through a process of situating oneself to evolving networks."
Crowdsourcing Perceptions of Fair Predictors for Machine Learning: A Recidivism Case Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359130,"The increased reliance on algorithmic decision-making in socially impactful processes has intensified the calls for algorithms that are unbiased and procedurally fair. Identifying fair predictors is an essential step in the construction of equitable algorithms, but the lack of ground-truth in fair predictor selection makes this a challenging task. In our study, we recruit 90 crowdworkers to judge the inclusion of various predictors for recidivism. We divide participants across three conditions with varying group composition. Our results show that participants were able to make informed decisions on predictor selection. We find that agreement with the majority vote is higher when participants are part of a more diverse group. The presented workflow, which provides a scalable and practical approach to reach a diverse audience, allows researchers to capture participants' perceptions of fairness in private while simultaneously allowing for structured participant discussion. Emerging HCI research on algorithmic fairness has pointed to the importance of research methods that are scalable [20], practical [55], and able to ensure a diverse sample [60]. This work investigates the feasibility of utilising crowdsourcing for fair predictor assessment in machine learning. Our results indicate that our participants were able to make an informed decision using graphs, as indicated by the explicitly verifiable questions and analysed chat logs. We found higher performance following discussion among diverse groups as compared to uniform groups. Our study provides a look into the use of crowdworkers in discussions concerning the critical area of algorithmic fairness. It offers a structured and scalable approach, based on interactive (group) conversations led by a bot. Future work may expand this work into other areas of algorithmic fairness outside of predictor selection, and offer a more systematic assessment on the effect of group diversity"
Makers and Quilters: Investigating Opportunities for Improving Gender-Imbalanced Maker Groups,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359131,"Recent efforts to diversify participation in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math) activities through informal learning environments, such as hackathons and makerspaces, confirm a real desire for inclusion among potential female participants. However, understanding factors that may contribute to longer-term, sustainable diversification of such groups remains a challenge. In this paper, we present the results of a mixed-methods study of two microcosms of making: game development, and quilting. Our findings reveal parallel structures within these groups despite being highly skewed towards male or female participation, respectively. Our results shed light on attitudes, behaviours, and experiences indicating that similar desires for wider community support among other factors exist in both groups, but these needs are not satisfied in the STEM context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings as opportunities for rethinking how we design the environments that are meant to support design itself, considering the role of technology in these spaces, and prioritizing nurturing the development of the maker community beyond the maker space. In this work, we investigated crafting spaces as an extension of existing work on maker groups, focusing on female-dominated quilting groups in comparison to the masculine culture of game jams. Through fieldwork and thematic analysis as well as questionnaire data on intrinsic motivation, we found that participants’ feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness were satisfied in different ways across the quilting group, and that the STEM-oriented game jam failed to provide opportunities to engage a more diverse group of people. We offer a number of recommendations to consider how game jams, and by extension, maker groups might be reimagined, boiling down to a shift in focus: Instead of focusing on specific goals to achieve, organizers could put their efforts into fostering longer-lasting community ties through satisfaction of needs."
Automatically Analyzing Brainstorming Language Behavior with Meeter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359132,"Language both influences and indicates group behavior, and we need tools that let us study the content of what is communicated. While one could annotate these spoken dialogue acts by hand, this is a tedious, not scalable process. We present Meeter, a tool for automatically detecting information sharing, shared understanding, word counts, and group activation in spoken interactions. The contribution of our work is two-fold: (1) We validated the tool by showing that the measures computed by Meeter align with human-generated labels, and (2) we demonstrated the value of Meeter as a research tool by quantifying aspects of group behavior using those measures and deriving novel findings from that. Our tool is valuable for researchers conducting group science, as well as those designing groupware systems. In this paper, we presented the Meeter tool for automatic detection of language group processes from speech using linguistic and prosody analysis. We showed that with Meeter, a number of important group behavior measures, can be detected automatically and that these measures are highly correlated with measurements produced by human annotators. We further validated the tool by studying relationships between group processes detected by Meeter and group outcomes: (1) Groups that showed higher levels of information sharing and shared understanding were more satisfied; (2) Groups that used fewer words were more satisfied; (3) More activated groups as measured through speech prosody, showed higher levels of group performance. Our study shows that tools that automatically and accurately quantify group behaviors could enable larger-scale studies and make it possible to conduct group behavior measurements in the wild, and such tools could enable novel automated interventions."
Towards Successful Knowledge Integration in Online Collaboration: An Experiment on the Role of Meta-Knowledge,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359133,"Successful knowledge integration, that is, systematic synthesis of unshared information, is key to suc-cess, but at the same time a challenging venture for teams with distributed knowledge collaborating online. For example, teams with heterogeneous knowledge often have only vague or even wrong ideas about who knows what. This situation is further complicated if the collaboration partners do not know each other and merely communicate online. Previous research has found meta-knowledge, that is, knowledge about one's own and the partner's knowledge areas, to be a promising but not yet sufficient-ly investigated approach to promote knowledge integration. With our experimental study we aimed to address this desideratum of research on the role of meta-knowledge in net-based collaborations. We ""simulated"" a chat-based collaboration between partners with heterogeneous knowledge by assigning specific information to students collaborating in dyads on a Hidden Profile task. To arrive at the correct joint solution for this task, collaborating partners had to pool their shared, but more importantly their unshared information. We compared two conditions: In the experimental condition meta-knowledge was promoted by providing the collaboration partners with self-presentations of each other's roles, which pointed to their unique fields of knowledge, while participants in the control condition did not receive this information. Results suggest a positive impact of the meta-knowledge manipulation on two key factors of collaboration: knowledge integration and construction of a transactive memory system (TMS)."
"""This Place Does What It Was Built For"": Designing Digital Institutions for Participatory Change",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359134,"Whether we recognize it or not, the Internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the ""Ostrom Workshop."" A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a ""constitutional layer"" of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions. Despite the increasing importance of digital institutions, CSCW’s strong traditional interests in participatory design and online communities have generated little synthesis. Our aim in this work is to appreciate the complexity of digital institution design, while still aiming to ultimately be engaging in it. The participatory tradition in digital institution design, kicked off in large part by Kollock and Smith [68], has lagged behind other, more convenient paradigms. Kraut and Resnick’s Building Successful Online Communities represents one of the most influential and theoretically-grounded paradigms within the space of digital institution design. While its psychological engineering approach offers a useful slate of design tricks, such approaches have prioritized top-down thinking over designing institutions for substantive participation. As convenient as it is for platforms serving hundreds of millions of users, behavioral engineering design thinking fails to incorporate values fundamental to fair, resilient, and ethical digital institutions. The limitations of the engineering approach have become impossible to ignore since at least 2016: an emphasis on monetized engagement over end-user safety gave tools to outside agents who hijacked the behavioral change and engagement maximization capabilities of online platforms toward malicious ends. The result is online platforms that have lost control over their coupling to broader geo-political forces, and are failing to give users governance responsibilities, or fulfill their rights. The fields of human computer interaction, social computing, and computer-supported cooperative work find their history in the design of interfaces to support individual user experiences, supporting group work, and understanding and designing for technology use in context. Dourish [29] and Grudin [50] have outlined how ethnographic methods came to be adopted within human-computer interaction in response to the need for understanding the social organization and contexts of technology use in “real world” settings beyond controlled laboratory environments. As these research communities have moved their attention to larger-scale settings, they have often brought the same limited image of the user’s role [7]. Existing design processes have excluded individual users from substantive roles in system change, preferring instead to embed them into lower-level roles, and interfaces engineered to nudge behavior to suit design goals. Frameworks for analyzing the design of institutions offer an additional step “upwards” and invite comparisons of these organizations and contexts. Where an experimental or evaluation perspective might ask which rules users perceive to be fair, or an archival or ethnographic perspective might analyze the unfolding interactions around implementing rules, an institutional design perspective asks what kinds of norms and rules (operational level), what implementation strategies (collective level), and what rule-making processes (constitutional level) are used, how these interact, and what alternatives exist. Dourish [30] argued for broadening HCI from the interactions between user and screen and orienting to considerations of scale for design engagements. The Ostrom Workshop’s frameworks go a long way towards participatory design’s concern for the “politics of design” as well as answering Dourish’s call for a “design of politics” within HCI [30] by considering the design of institutions that are focused on governing a system’s limited resources through participatory and democratic mechanisms. At a time when issues such as the disappearance of application programming interfaces (APIs) signal concentration of control in the hands of platform owners (cf. [58]), consideration of participation is of the utmost important. The designers of digital institutions should look to resource management approaches as they confront the limits of their crumbling governance strategies. The Ostrom Workshop in particular has several successful frameworks for theorizing and classifying the technological, cultural, economic, and political strategies employed by institutions across a variety of contexts and scales. These frameworks make more facets of digital institution design legible to CSCW scholars. The engineers, scientists, and managers on major social platforms are engaged in digital institution design by making choices about roles, resources, rights, rules, and governance. However, research and teaching emphasizing resource management and institutional analysis are conspicuously absent from the computer and information science and engineering fields from which platforms’ governing engineers, designers, and managers are recruited. With more general frameworks that permit more ambitious comparisons of more diverse institutions, we get closer to a science of digital institution design that is general enough to avoid the problem of asssuming away the future’s most creative, innovative, and inspiring experiments in digital democracy."
The Dynamics of Peer-Produced Political Information During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359135,"Wikipedia plays a crucial role for online information seeking and its editors have a remarkable capacity to rapidly revise its content in response to current events. How did the production and consumption of political information on Wikipedia mirror the dynamics of the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign? Drawing on systems justification theory and methods for measuring the enthusiasm gap among voters, this paper quantitatively analyzes the candidates' biographical and related articles and their editors. Information production and consumption patterns match major events over the course of the campaign, but Trump-related articles show consistently higher levels of engagement than Clinton-related articles. Analysis of the editors' participation and backgrounds show analogous shifts in the composition and durability of the collaborations around each candidate. The implications for using Wikipedia to monitor political engagement are discussed. Wikipedia’s centrality as an online reference provides important context about the supply and demand for information during a political campaign. This analysis demonstrated a significant and sustained enthusiasm gap for creating, editing, and viewing content favoring Trump over Clinton existed on Wikipedia. In almost every metric examined, content related to Trump attracted more editors, more revisions, more new articles, larger articles, and more page views than content related to Clinton. These differences emerged relatively early in the primaries, were amplified over the course of the campaign, and are not explained by changes in the likelihood of each candidate winning. Instead, this enthusiasm gap in political information production and consumption may be an effect of Wikipedia editors responding to coverage disparities in the broader media ecosystem rather than partisan agendas. These findings have implications for researchers examining the effects of political communication, candidates and their campaigns understanding political information seeking behavior of large populations, as well as the Wikipedia community reflecting on its responsibilities within a complex media ecosystem influencing political outcomes."
Implications of Grassroots Sustainable Agriculture Community Values on the Design of Information Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359136,"Information system designers embed values into the systems they design, even if unwittingly. However, the values embedded in many information systems clash with values held by many sustainability communities. This research focuses on two grassroots sustainable agriculture communities, which are seeking to develop a food infrastructure that is under their own control, and thereby more resilient to disruptions across the globe. This paper presents a five-year ethnographic study of these two communities, maps out the values of members of these communities, and explores the implications of their values on the information systems that members use and that could be developed to support them in the future. By doing so, we hope to influence the design of future information systems to align more closely with the values of these stakeholders, and through these stakeholders to move toward a food system that supports food security and global sustainability. This paper introduced the values of two permaculture communities that impact their information system design and use. These long-term, resistance, and technology values yielded a set of implications for information system and technology design not often considered by mainstream academic and industry HCI. Most common-place sociotechnical systems are unsustainable because they are built to meet goals that are at odds with long term sustainability, such as the aggregation of money and power and other short-term goals. We demonstrated how such unsustainable features are also antithetical to the participating communities values and practices. Developing information systems based on the values and practices of sustainability communities such as those that participated in this work has the potential to transform the information system landscape to one that can support the design and development of sustainable agriculture, if not to one that is broadly sustainable and equitable. Harrison, Tatar, and Sengers [32] explain that meaning is derived from information and that meaning is dependent on viewpoints, interactions, histories, and local resources to make sense of that information. These communities shared common core values and information from the permaculture movement which lead to an overlap in community-specific long-term, resistance, and technology values. With thousands more permaculture communities in the world, not to mention other grassroots sustainable agriculture communities, these long-term, resistance, and technology values are a relatively common set of values that warrant rigorous exploration and consideration in CSCW and HCI research. However, because of the potential variance in meanings based on interactions, histories, and local resources, it is important that we do not assume that one permaculture or sustainable agriculture community is the same as the others and that a information system or technology for one community will work for another. Action research initiatives such as this one can guide designers toward information system solutions that support the communities they are working with. Though they may not be tailored to any other specific community, resulting information systems may provide other communities with better suited technologies than the ones created for a general, tech-enthusiast population. If the technologies we design for specific communities are open for adoption and revision, other communities that derive similar meaning from environmental and social information suddenly have the ability to modify or tailor tools rather than build from scratch or conform to the vastly different values embedded in other tools."
Towards Digitization of Collaborative Savings Among Low-Income Groups,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274304,"Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) is a mechanism of informal collaborative savings that is widely used across the globe. Despite its popularity and prevalence, it is not well-studied from HCI and CSCW perspectives. The global increase in mobile penetration has created opportunities to serve the unbanked using mobile-based Digital Financial Services (DFS) for greater financial inclusion but there have not been any DFS-based interventions around ROSCAs. In this paper, we report a qualitative study involving 80 individuals to understand the dynamics of ROSCAs and opportunities for their digitization in the Pakistani context. We also present a smartphone-based Digital ROSCA platform designed on top of a simulated mobile money system. The platform was designed to be inclusive towards low-literate users. We present qualitative findings of its evaluation with 15 users (3 individual ROSCA groups). We find that digitization has the potential to support and strengthen traditional ROSCAs by mitigating issues like record-keeping, delayed payments, collection, distribution, and safety of money. It also allows the creation of payment history for individuals that can be used to score their financial credibility. ROSCAs are a popular informal collaborative saving mechanism around the globe. In this research, we present a qualitative study of 80 individuals to understand the dynamics of ROSCAs and identify the opportunities for their digitization. We built a smartphone-based Digital ROSCA application to facilitate the working of ROSCAs, make them more inclusive, and overcome the issues associated with them. The Digital ROSCA application was tested with 15 users (3 individual ROSCA groups) and our findings reveal that digitization of this collaborative saving practice mitigates the issues like record-keeping, delayed payments, collection, distribution, and safety. In the future, we plan to test the Digital ROSCA application with a larger user-base and for a longer duration. We also plan to replace the simulated mobile money back-end with real-world mobile money systems. Currently, our service only facilitates smartphone users. We plan to cater to other modalities such as SMS, USSD, IVR in the future, as explained Section 8.2. To preserve social capital between organizers and members, the Digital ROSCA application currently does not impose penalties on delayed payments. However, support for various (optional) monetary and non-monetary penalties can be provided in future versions. Digital ROSCA have the potential for encouraging digital payments by extending liquidity farming [40] in two ways, by creating groups with people outside of an individual’s social circle, and by qualifying for credit from a serviceprovider based on Digital ROSCA transaction history. This requires the creation of a combination of social and credit rating mechanisms, which replace social trust with quantified behavior in ROSCA groups. Digital ROSCAs also present opportunities for extending customer engagement beyond simple savings in groups to investments by providing advisory for the investment of unplanned savings, and collaborations with e-commerce platforms for allowing the purchase of durable goods."
"""The Most Trustworthy Coin"": How Ideological Tensions Drive Trust in Bitcoin",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359138,"Bitcoin is an innovative technological network, a new, non-governmental currency, and a worldwide group of users. In other words, Bitcoin is a complex sociotechnical system with a complex set of risks and challenges for anyone using it. We investigated how everyday users of Bitcoin develop trust in Bitcoin on one of the largest online communities devoted to Bitcoin: the Reddit.com r/bitcoin forum. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined how trust in Bitcoin develops based on contributions to this community. On r/bitcoin, trust in Bitcoin is driven by a pervasive ideology we call the ""True Bitcoiner"" ideology. This ideological viewpoint in centered on the interpretation of Bitcoin as functionally ""trustless"" and risk-free. Despite widespread evidence of emerging individual and system-level risks with using Bitcoin, participants continue to maintain this ideological perspective. This ideology consists of three primary beliefs: viewing Bitcoin's technology as more trustworthy than its people; rejecting 'corrupt' social hierarchies related to money; and the importance of accumulating or 'HODLing' quantities of Bitcoin as a strategy to create an ideal future. We conclude that this ""True Bitcoiner"" ideology is maintained despite contradictory evidence in the world because it allows participants to more easily interpret Bitcoin and make decisions by reducing perceived risk and uncertainty in the system. The role of this ideology on r/bitcoin demonstrates an expanded conceptualization of how trust is created and socially-mediated in socio-technical contexts. Bitcoin is a complex socio-technical system [10] that depends on user trust [2] in order to function properly. By analyzing almost three months of postings on the r/bitcoin subreddit, we described how people use this online community to build and maintain trust in Bitcoin. We found that participants have a specific “True Bitcoiner” ideology that they promote. This ideology is founded on an interlocking set of beliefs that define Bitcoin’s underlying technology as infallible, interpret existing institutions of money and powerful people as corrupt, and allow the collective imagination of an idealized Bitcoin future produced by accumulating and “HODLing” Bitcoin. These beliefs all connect back to the core belief that stems to Bitcoin’s intended purpose: a “trustless” system of money. Despite ample contradictory interpretations and real-world failings, this belief in the trustless nature of Bitcoin is maintained by this ideological perspective. Interpreting Bitcoin as trustless reduces interpretive complexity, minimizes the recognition of risk, and supports the development of community camaraderie to collectively imagine, and work towards, a new Bitcoin future. This ideology’s role in socio-technical building has implications for how people understand and use socio-technical systems broadly. It is difficult to build trust in a complex socio-technical system like Bitcoin when most people do not fully understand that system. But it is important to do so, or people won’t use the system. This “True Bitcoiner” ideology that has emerged on r/bitcoin gives participants in the subreddit ways to justify trusting the system, and the tensions we identified give the subreddit participants ample opportunity to do so. The role of ideology in other socio-technical contexts has potentially major implications, as our findings have demonstrated, for how people interpret the system, build community around it, and develop ideological beliefs. Ideology in the media has contributed to the rise and fall of empires throughout recorded history [58]. As socio-technical places continue to become more ingrained in how people learn and connect with one another, the way ideology influences how people imagine the reality of these systems and their place within them could have far-reaching consequences. What technology people decide to trust could shape the landscape of trust in modern socio-technical life. Just like experiences of trust, the nature of modern socio-technical systems is continuous evolution and change. As our findings demonstrate, the role everyday people do in trusting, internalizing, and sharing ideological perspectives on these complex systems has the potential to change the very nature of these systems."
StressMon: Scalable Detection of Perceived Stress and Depression Using Passive Sensing of Changes in Work Routines and Group Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359139,"Stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. These features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. To validate StressMon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. Our evaluation demonstrated StressMon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01% True Positive Rate (TPR), an 80.76% True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 0.97 area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. In addition, StressMon was able to detect depression at 91.21% TPR, 66.71% TNR, and 0.88 AUC using a 15-day window. We end by discussing how StressMon can expand CSCW research, especially in areas involving collaborative practices for mental health management. We presented StressMon, a system to detect severe stress and depressive episodes in individuals. StressMon is designed to be a scalable solution that does not require installing specific applications or owning specific devices. Using coarse-grained location data collected directly from the WiFi infrastructure, we extracted features of individuals’ routine behaviours and features that sufficiently describe an individuals’ physical interaction patterns. These features were used in two different models to detect stress and depression, respectively. We demonstrated, via three different semesterlong user studies involving 108 students at a university campus, that StressMon has an Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.97 (96.01% TPR and 80.76% TNR) at detecting stress using 6-days interval, and an AUC of 0.88 (91.21% TPR and 66.71% TNR) at detecting depression using 15-day intervals."
How I Learned What a Domain Was,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359140,"This paper re-traverses the author's investigations across several years as he sought to pin-down the meaning of the in vivo category 'domain'. The paper is a methodological reflection on the grounded theory approach to concept development, with a focus on the technical terms: in vivo category, iteration on the code, and sensitizing category. It is also a substantive theoretical contribution, elaborating the concept of a domain in computing, data and information science, and how it has long served as an organizing principle for developing computational systems. Four tricks of the trade for studying the 'logic of domains' are offered as sensitizing concepts to aid future investigations."
How Data Scientists Use Computational Notebooks for Real-Time Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359141,"Effective collaboration in data science can leverage domain expertise from each team member and thus improve the quality and efficiency of the work. Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists. We probed into how synchronous editing in computational notebooks might change the way data scientists collaborate on a predictive modeling task. Our survey findings highlight the tools and strategies that data scientists currently used in collaboration practice. Based on the design of current synchronous editing features in computational notebooks, our empirical observation reveals that working on the same notebook results in different collaboration styles compared to working on individual notebooks. The key findings suggest that synchronous editing tools improve collaboration by helping data scientists maintain a shared context and improve work efficiency. However, the current real-time collaborative editing features may lead to several problems (e.g., interference with each others’ work, unbalanced contributions). The challenges in using the current real-time collaboration features suggest that we need better collaborative editing features for computational notebooks. We discuss how our results extend prior work on collaborative editing and how the HCI community can play a vital role in broadening the understanding of collaborative data science with a human-centered approach. Finally, we propose design implications to enhance synchronous editing in computational notebooks and to improve collaboration among data science workers."
Challenges and Design Considerations for Multimodal Asynchronous Collaboration in VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359142,"Studies on collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) have suggested capture and later replay of multimodal interactions (e.g., speech, body language, and scene manipulations), which we refer to as multimodal recordings, as an effective medium for time-distributed collaborators to discuss and review 3D content in an immersive, expressive, and asynchronous way. However, there exist gaps of empirical knowledge in understanding how this multimodal asynchronous VR collaboration (MAVRC) context impacts social behaviors in mediated-communication, workspace awareness in cooperative work, and user requirements for authoring and consuming multimedia recording. This study aims to address these gaps by conceptualizing MAVRC as a type of CSCW and by understanding the challenges and design considerations of MAVRC systems. To this end, we conducted an exploratory need-finding study where participants (N = 15) used an experimental MAVRC system to complete a representative spatial task in an asynchronously collaborative setting, involving both consumption and production of multimodal recordings. Qualitative analysis of interview and observation data from the study revealed unique, core design challenges of MAVRC in: (1) coordinating proxemic behaviors between asynchronous collaborators, (2) providing traceability and change awareness across different versions of 3D scenes, (3) accommodating viewpoint control to maintain workspace awareness, and (4) supporting navigation and editing of multimodal recordings. We discuss design implications, ideate on potential design solutions, and conclude the paper with a set of design recommendations for MAVRC systems. In this paper, we investigated asynchronous VR collaboration based on multimodal recording for spatial tasks. Using our experimental system, which affords the capture and replay of multiple interaction modalities, we conducted a qualitative, exploratory study where participants consumed and produced recordings to collaborate on interior design. Participants displayed social behaviors, such as proxemics and empathy, even when viewing a replayed representation of an asynchronous collaborator. Viewpoint management and awareness were critical for coordinating varying perspectives without real-time feedback in spatial VR. While immersion in CVEs can help build up 3D context in spatial tasks, it may disorient users when switching between different versions of scenes. Although interior design is a popular representative spatial task, not all of our results are necessarily transferable to other types of asynchronous tasks in VR. They may vary by spatial scale (e.g., urban planning), number of collaborators (e.g., virtual conferences), and the complexity of the required multimodal interactions. Applying our method to different task contexts will help us triangulate and contrast findings, further inspiring future work. We are aware of some limitations of the study. First, our depiction of a versioning mechanism shown in Figure 4 is specific to our implementation of the experimental system and cannot be generalized to all possible implementations of MAVRC systems. Another implementation-specific example is that, as an initial exploration into characterizing MAVRC, our system only supported viewing a single recording at a time. Future work could investigate the utility of a different implementation that affords viewing multiple recordings or scenes in parallel. Second, the choice of interaction modalities are only representative of what is affordable in the current VR infrastructure. For example, given that eye-tracking is beginning to be commonly integrated into the latest VR headsets [41], one might consider replicating our study with an implementation that can capture user gaze as a way to register awareness and attention of the collaborators. Third, participants only exchanged a single chain of multimodal recordings. Tasks that involve back-and-forth chains of asynchronous messages are costly, but important to study. Tracking across a long history of past scene changes is likely more challenging to understand and manage. Extending our design implications to augmented reality (AR) may be a promising angle. However, regarding version control issues, reality-virtuality conflicts [88] are more difficult to resolve than virtuality-virtuality conflicts in VR. An AR user’s viewpoint is strictly bounded to their real body, so addressing the time-space navigation problem will be a non-trivial problem. Exploring how heterogeneous collaborators (e.g., multiple co-located/distant or synchronous/asynchronous collaborators) might work together in a similarly immersive system could also be challenging but rewarding."
"""I think people are powerful"": The Sociality of Individuals Managing Depression",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359143,"Millions of Americans struggle with depression, a condition characterized by feelings of sadness and motivation loss. To understand how individuals managing depression conceptualize their self-management activities, we conducted visual elicitations and semi-structured interviews with 30 participants managing depression in a large city in the U.S. Midwest. Many depression support tools are focused on the individual user and do not often incorporate social features. However, our analysis showed the key importance of sociality for self-management of depression. We describe how individuals connect with specific others to achieve expected support and how these interactions are mediated through locations and communication channels. We discuss factors influencing participants' sociality including relationship roles and expectations, mood state and communication channels, location and privacy, and culture and society. We broaden our understanding of sociality in CSCW through discussing diffuse sociality (being proximate to others but not interacting directly) as an important activity to support depression self-management. To study the self-management activities of individuals managing depression, we conducted visual elicitations and semi-structured interviews with 30 participants managing depression in a large city in the U.S. Midwest. We found that sociality was a key aspect of self-management for our participants, who connected with others through direct and indirect methods and used technologies and locations in diverse ways. We extend previous literature that has largely focused on the online activities of individuals managing depression [34,46,103] by showing how individuals conceptualize connecting with others both digitally and physically as part of their selfmanagement activities. We expand our understanding of sociality in CSCW through the addition of diffuse sociality, being in proximate location to others but not interacting directly. We can better support individuals’ self-management of depression by considering factors influencing their sociality including relationship roles and expectations, mood state and communication channels, location and privacy, and culture and society. Future design of mental health support tools for this population should consider approaches and solutions that facilitate social connection to meet a range of user expectations, across a variety of communication channels and digital and physical environments."
Collaborative Data Work Towards a Caring Democracy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359144,"Researchers in human-centered computing have surfaced a feminist ethic of care in interaction with technologies, in data collection, and in data work. Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, we consider how democratic caring might be enacted and sustained through collaborative data work. We employ philosopher Joan Tronto's theory of caring democracy to structure our analysis of a resident-led initiative that uses data to organize and address issues of neglect and abandonment in their neighborhood. Adding to the CSCW literature on sociotechnical systems of care, we look particularly at Tronto's concept of caring democracy where caring needs and the ways in which they are met are an ongoing and inclusive process of assigning and reassigning caring responsibilities, characterized by both equality of voice and freedom from domination. This work develops grounded insight into the practice of democratic caring and how collaborative data work is relevant to this caring practice. We discuss opportunities and challenges for a data-supported caring democracy and address how caring democracy technologies are different from other modern civic technology practices. We conclude with a call to researchers to identify and enact democratic caring experiments in the small. Tronto’s concept of a caring democracy, is, even according to Tronto, an abstraction. The specifics of contemporary society are absent in Tronto’s theory. This is not a shortcoming or critique of Tronto's work. It is a recognition of the difference between political philosophy and engaged research with grassroots activism. Using Tronto’s theory of caring democracy as a methodological lens in our engaged research, we identified potentials for collaborative data work to support ethical qualities of caring democracy. We also observed the great challenge of caring democracy and that as Les enacts these moral qualities of a caring democracy through his data work, and engages in caring with he is also always having to negotiate boundaries and limitations of the various aspects of the network he is working within: the personal preferences of different Code Enforcement officers, different commitments to the neighborhood from different mayoral administrations, and so on. In the participatory design literature, there is a notion of “democratic design experiments in the small” [10]. The idea is that while democracy occurs at the level of the state, it also occurs through direct action, through the activities of publics of varying sizes. The work of democracy, from this perspective, is to engage in ongoing trials of how we might differently configure our lives together, through making and the use of made things. This idea dovetails with Les’ ongoing work towards enacting a caring democracy. Indeed, while some might see the limitations of Les’ work as a deficiency—particularly in this moment where issues and presumed opportunities of scale are so prominent in both popular discourse and the research in human centered computing—we see the scope of Les’ work as part of its defining character and value. Caring democracy need not be enacted at the level of the state, or for that matter even at the level of the institution. As a democratic design experiment in the small, care can be enacted by a single person in relation to their community through qualities of attentiveness, shared responsibility, competence, responsiveness, and solidarity. If we accept this, then one challenge for human centered computing is to consider how to design at this scale and with these qualities, for the work of democracy, and in particular a caring democracy, in the small."
VidLyz: An Interactive Approach to Assist Novice Entrepreneurs in Making Persuasive Campaign Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359145,"Videos are essential for successful crowdfunding campaigns. However, without knowledge of the underlying persuasion factors, novice entrepreneurs may find it difficult to optimize their videos for success. This paper presents VidLyz, a novel assistive tool that allows users to explore the implications of audience-engagement persuasion factors in the context of campaign videos through contrasting examples, crowd-sourced subjective ratings, and feedback on engagement factors. VidLyz promotes active thinking about the impact of audience persuasion factors in making an effective campaign video by guiding novice entrepreneurs in planning materials of their videos on their own, with consideration of the product category, the target audience, and audience-product interactions. To evaluate our system, we collected subjective ratings and feedback on persuasion factors for 140 Kickstarter campaign videos from 2100 crowd workers and presented them through our prototype VidLyz tool. A user study with 45 novice users and five previous campaign creators found that our tool was useful for understanding the implication and relative importance of the persuasion factors of the campaign videos. The interactive and active thinking elements of VidLyz promoted novice users to make coherent and persuasive pre-production plan (using storyboards) for their proposed campaign videos. A follow-up user study showed that these storyboards had a higher likelihood of getting funded by crowd workers than those with less persuasive pre-production plan. We concluded with design implications to better support novice entrepreneurs. Novice entrepreneurs put a lot of effort in making the materials of their crowdfunding campaigns. One of the most complicated things to make can be the campaign video. Persuasive campaign videos can increase the probability of success for crowdfunding campaigns significantly. However, making a persuasive video may not be an easy task for novice entrepreneurs. In this paper, we identified the challenges that novice entrepreneurs may face to make their videos persuasive with limited knowledge. We proposed VidLyz, an assistive tool to help novice entrepreneurs understand how persuasion factors can make a campaign video engaging to the audience. The primary design goals and components of VidLyz contribute to the domain of building a persuasive system for the end-user. Our evaluation suggests that through an interactive interface and guided active thinking, VidLyz can assist novice entrepreneurs in planning an effective persuasive campaign video."
Technological Frames and User Innovation: Exploring Technological Change in Community Moderation Teams,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359146,"Management of technological change in organizations is one of the most enduring topics in the literature on computer-supported cooperative work. The successful navigation of technological change is both more challenging and more critical in online communities that are entirely mediated by technology than it is in traditional organizations. This paper presents an analysis of 14 in-depth interviews with moderators of subcommunities of one technological platform (Reddit) that added communities on a new technological platform (Discord). Moderation teams experienced several problems related to moderating content at scale as well as a disconnect between the affordances of Discord and their assumptions based on their experiences on Reddit. We found that moderation teams used Discord's API to create scripts and bots that augmented Discord to make the platform work more like tools on Reddit. These tools were particularly important in communities struggling with scale. Our findings suggest that increasingly widespread end user programming allow users of social computing systems to innovate and deploy solutions to unanticipated design problems by transforming new technological platforms to align with their past expectations. We investigated the challenges of technological change experienced by volunteer moderation teams of online communities that added a new technological platform with different social and technological affordances. While moderators of small Discord communities felt their work was manageable with the new platform’s built-in moderation tools, teams from large communities were challenged with content moderation at scale, managing community information, and organizing communication with their community members. We show that teams’ technological frames, drawn from their experience using Reddit’s moderation tools, influenced the strategic design and use of a range of user innovations built using Discord’s API. These innovations took the form of bots that transformed features of Discord in ways that made the platform function like moderation tools available on Reddit. We discuss the consequences of technological change in online communities in terms of the organizational and governance systems that are reconstituted when users are given the tools to reconstruct their technological platform in ways that resemble familiar systems of governance. We argue that end user programming toolkits, like Discord’s API, can provide online communities with the building blocks to develop the tools to sustain growth and adapt to change. Designers can speculate as to how to best support users of a new system. Our work shows how, through user innovation driven guided by technological frames, users can build the systems they need through inspiration drawn from the systems they already know."
Causal Effects of Brevity on Style and Success in Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359147,"In online communities, where billions of people strive to propagate their messages, understanding how wording affects success is of primary importance. In this work, we are interested in one particularly salient aspect of wording: brevity. What is the causal effect of brevity on message success? What are the linguistic traits of brevity? When is brevity beneficial, and when is it not? Whereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success in observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd workers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd workers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. This allows us to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. We find that concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages up to a length reduction of 30--40%. The optimal reduction is on average between 10% and 20%. The observed effect is robust across different subpopulations of raters and is the strongest for raters who visit social media on a daily basis. Finally, we discover unique linguistic and content traits of brevity and correlate them with the measured probability of success in order to distinguish effective from ineffective shortening strategies. Overall, our findings are important for developing a better understanding of the effect of brevity on the success of messages in online social media. In this work, our goals are threefold: to measure the effects of length constraints on tweet quality, to determine the linguistic traits of brevity, and to find when brevity is beneficial. To address these goals, we designed a large experiment and deployed it on the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. Our two-stage experimental pipeline first generated valid, shortened versions of original tweets, then measured the quality of the shortened versions compared with the originals. In our experiment, we observed that tweets of an original length of 250 characters can be successfully reduced by up to 30–40% of their original length with no reduction in quality. The optimal range of shortening is consistently reducing between 10% and 20% of the original length."
"""My cousin bought the phone for me. I never go to mobile shops."": The Role of Family in Women's Technological Inclusion in Islamic Culture",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359148,"The intersection of Islam and gender affect technological and social interactions for Muslim women in significant ways and remains an understudied domain for CSCW and related fields. Building on 73 qualitative interviews with low-income women in Punjab, Pakistan, we analyze the complexity of family relationships and the subsequent dynamics of authority around technology uptake and usage by women within non-Western contexts, and, specifically, within the Islamic world. We argue that a Pakistani woman's experience with technology depends on many factors, including gendered roles, generational differences in a family, and wider socio-cultural and religious influences against the backdrop of a culturally conservative and patriarchal society. Our paper highlights the rich family dynamics, including key life events, that transform the roles of both Muslim women and their relatives. Our work is intended to inform scholars, practitioners within development agencies and industry, and other individuals studying technology and development about household dynamics that influence Muslim women's use of technology to encourage them to consider these dynamics during design and implementation processes for technological inclusion. We interviewed 73 low-income Pakistani women about their technology knowledge, access, ownership, use, and non-use. For these women, the family was the source of their motivations, and family members enabled or limited women’s use of technology. We demonstrate how different family members in an Islamic society held roles as those who introduce, teach, maintain, and buy technologies in addition to restricting, monitoring, and disapproving of technology use. This work is significant because it offers a lens into how to assess technology engagement and technological inclusion of women in non-Western and Islamic contexts."
Information Materialities of Citizen Communication in the U.S. Congress,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359149,"In this paper, we use a materiality lens to explore how information and communication technologies condition interaction between citizens and policymakers of the U.S. Congress. We work with ethnographic data - six months of observation in Washington D.C. and 48 interviews with staff in the House of Representatives. Customer relation management systems (CRMs) used by Congress are one of numerous technologies expected to enhance responsive communication between citizens and representatives. We find, instead, that these technologies promote the datafication of citizen information that configures and constrains how policymakers engage citizens as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. CRMs not only mediate communication between citizens and policymakers, they shape the idea of what communication between citizens and policymakers can be and how citizens are viewed in the eyes of policymakers and their staff. Thus, we extend our understanding of the ways in which material configurations of communication technologies influence not only how communication acts unfolds, but also how each partner conceives of and engages with the other. This has dramatic implications for the possibilities of digital communication channels to enhance, or uphold, the ideals of a representative democracy. We engage a material lens to evaluate three moments during Member-citizen communication where the materiality of the CRMs relates to the representation of citizen information. These moments are (1) during the input of citizen information, (2) the transformation of that information into data for analysis, and (3) the production of written responses to citizens. We find that the ways in which CRMs log and manage information about citizen communication creates discursive expectations that prioritize data-collection and customer satisfaction over substantive engagement. In so doing, CRMs limit the possibility for citizens to be recognized as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. Thus, we offer insight into a case where data-driven technologies elicit pathways for perceived communication and citizen engagement, without inspiring true influence to policy decisions. We find that citizens are continuing to lose their ability to civically engage their policymakers as a result of technological intervention."
Speedrunning for Charity: How Donations Gather Around a Live Streamed Couch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359150,"Games Done Quick (GDQ) is both a week-long video game speedrunning marathon and a successful charity event, raising more than $1.5 million USD in each of its past five events. To understand GDQ's success as an online charity event, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with GDQ speedrunners, attendees, hosts, and online viewers, analyzed past donation data, and conducted 72 hours of in-person participant observations at a live GDQ event. We found that central to every GDQ event is ""the couch"" which reconstructs the environment of a living room. Viewers do not simply donate to support the charity or in response to the technical prowess and ingenuity of speedrunners, but to actively interact with and be part of the couch experience, the ideal social milieu of speedrunning. Building upon previously identified motivations of why viewers donate to online live streamers, our work contributes to understanding how collocated gatherings can reinforce and amplify the cultural and social aspects of online subcultures (even heterogeneous ones) to encourage charitable giving. This opens opportunities for design that evoke a visceral level of engagement with charity events similar to that observed at GDQ. Games Done Quick has found great success as a charity organization, raising millions of USD for charity twice a year. Drawing from participant observations, interviews with key stakeholders, and analyzing donation data, our findings show that viewers of GDQ are motivated to donate to support laudable charity goals, celebrate gameplay skill and commentating on speedruns, and socially interact with the live-streamed event. We also identify a significant motivating factor for viewers to donate: the social milieu of the couch. Harkening back to its humble origins in living rooms, the couch at GDQ acts as a specialized digital hearth wherein participation around the couch is highly sought after by viewers. Here, the digital hearth itself becomes a form of entertainment and an opportunity for social engagement that is live streamed. Viewers can virtually join the couch by donating and having their donation message read on stream. The rotating cast around the couch brings in different subcommunities of speedrunning, pooling diverse donations that vie for access to the couch. We envision future work will study the inner-workings of the GDQ organization itself—its processes, actors, history, and culture—to better understand technology’s role in charitable fundraising and its relationship in brokering charity organizations. The social milieu of the couch is not unique to GDQ. Other charity live-stream events (e.g., Desert Bus for Hope, GTLive Charity Stream, Project for Awesome) all centrally feature a couch on their streams. Opportunities exist for designs to support crowdfunding and charity organizations via infrastructures like those built for GDQ around their own “couches” to stimulate participation through donation. We hope this work encourages further study into how we may integrate entertainment technologies such as live streaming to foster actions for public good by a diverse, or even niche, set of online consumers."
Learn2Earn: Using Mobile Airtime Incentives to Bolster Public Awareness Campaigns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359151,"In rural parts of the developing world, spreading awareness about critical issues in health, governance, and other topics is challenging and costly. Traditional media such as print, radio and TV each have limitations and offer little guarantee that new information is absorbed or retained by the target population. This paper describes Learn2Earn, a system that leverages mobile payments to bolster public awareness campaigns in rural India. Users call an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, listen to a brief audio tutorial, and take a multiple-choice quiz to check their understanding. People who pass the quiz receive a mobile top-up (about $0.14) and have the opportunity to earn additional credits by referring others to the system. We describe a pilot deployment of Learn2Earn in rural India that spread via word-of-mouth to over 15,000 people within seven weeks. Usage was concentrated among young men, many of them students. In a mixed-methods study, we draw upon call logs, electronic surveys, qualitative interviews, and other sources of data to suggest that Learn2Earn could be an effective way to build awareness about important topics. Running an awareness campaign in rural, low-resource areas has traditionally been costly, labor intensive, and difficult to evaluate. Learn2Earn represents a new approach in which funding for the campaign is re-appropriated into direct incentives for beneficiaries. The recent proliferation of mobile phones offers a new opportunity to automatically administer quizzes, transfer payments, track referrals, and monitor the real-time spread of a campaign. The technology underlying Learn2Earn is simple, scalable, and affordable, and can hypothetically scale to nationwide deployments in a short period of time. In this exploratory study, we sought to validate the feasibility of Learn2Earn for a pilot campaign in rural India. Our findings illustrated some strengths and weaknesses of the approach. Learn2Earn spread relatively quickly without any centralized communications outside of the initial seed group. Participants were able to learn the content and pass the quiz, were enthusiastic in referring others, and conveyed positive stories regarding the potential impact of the campaign on their community. Our study also identifies some opportunities for improvement, such as broadening participation beyond a narrow demographic (young men, many of them students) and preventing users from taking the quiz on behalf of others. We are actively refining the system in response to the study’s findings and are further exploring its potential in new and ongoing deployments."
The Principles and Limits of Algorithm-in-the-Loop Decision Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359152,"The rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. Yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. Society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. Given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. This paper contributes to such research in two ways. First, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. Second, through a controlled experimental study on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. We studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. Although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. Under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. These results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact."
The Coerciveness of the Primary Key: Infrastructure Problems in Human Services Work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359153,"The premise of a primary key is simple enough: every record or row in a table should have some number or string that can uniquely identify it. Primary keys are essential for linking data spread across database tables, and for looking up and retrieving data from specific records. Yet for an identifier that seems so straightforward and uncontroversial, we find myriad ways that this unassuming bit of infrastructure has an outsized influence in human services work. Through case studies of the organizational networks of two nonprofit human services organizations, we find that different stakeholders use variants of identifiers to support work practices that are far more complex and social than the linking of tables or the lookup of data. Yet we also find that the low-level technical properties of the primary key are often coercive, forcing end-users to work on the infrastructure's terms-influencing the nature and order of the work, creating new forms of work, and influencing the tenor of the relationships among stakeholders. The technical abstractions of the underlying infrastructure, then, start to become the de facto public policy. We conclude by offering design provocations for better supporting identification across a variety of contexts. Information infrastructures are, indeed, performative. The schemas and classification systems that privilege the collection and use of some data over others influence what is possible. But the identifiers and primary keys that enable the linking and accessing of those data are also performative. The technical properties that have been baked into the primary key shape work in often-coercive ways, forcing end-users to operate in the image of the infrastructure and to find ways of working around that infrastructure. In this research, then, we make the following contributions: • Elaborate a design space for identifiers, including empirically-observed variants of identifiers along axes of anonymity and uniqueness; Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 3, No. CSCW, Article 51. Publication date: November 2019. The Coerciveness of the Primary Key 51:23 • Present a descriptive account of four classes of sociotechnical work afforded by primary keys and other identifiers that do the work of primary keys; • Identify three technical abstractions of the primary key—that it cannot be changed, cannot be empty, and must be unique—the properties of which have forced end-users to work in the image of the infrastructure; • Suggest design provocations for better supporting identification across a variety of contexts; and • Provide an empirical account of infrastructural abstractions coercively influencing work practice and enacting de facto public policy. The data collected by human services organizations characterize some of society’s most pressing social problems. These data provide accounts of the interdependence of various human challenges; chronicle the successes and failures of potential remedies and solutions; and support data-driven decision-making for individuals, organizations, and larger communities. If the identifiers and primary keys that hold information infrastructures together and that bring information infrastructures together were more supportive of the sociotechnical context of these critical data, we could engender more transformative outcomes for human services organizations, their clients, the communities they work in, the donors who fund them, as well as the policymakers and citizens who have a stake in these organizations delivering effective services."
Computing Education for Intercultural Learning: Lessons from the Nairobi Play Project,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359154,"This paper explores computing education as a potential site for intercultural learning and encounter in post-conflict environments. It reports on ethnographic fieldwork from the Nairobi Play Project, a constructionist educational program serving adolescents aged 14-18 in urban and rural multi-ethnic refugee communities in Kenya. While the program offers programming and game design instruction, an equal goal is to foster interaction, collaboration, dialogue and understanding across cultural backgrounds. Based on fieldwork from two project cycles involving 5 after-school classes of 12-24 students each, we describe key affordances for encounter, important resistances to be managed or overcome, and emergent complications in the execution of such programs. We argue that many important accomplishments of intercultural learning occur through moments of friction, breakdowns, and gaps -- for example, technical challenges that produce sites of shared humour; frictions between intercultural activities and computing activities; acts of disrupting order; and unstructured time that students collaboratively fill in. We also describe significant complications in such programs, including pressures to adopt norms and practices consistent with dominant or majority cultures, and instances of intercultural bonding over artefacts with xenophobic themes. We reflect on the implications of these phenomena for the design of future programs that use computing as a backbone for intercultural learning or diversity and inclusion efforts in CSCW, ICTD, and allied fields of work. Intercultural learning is a challenging project, one made more difficult – but all the more important – in the context of the growing multi-ethnic and refugee communities produced by the experience of geopolitical conflict and displacement in a growing number of locations around the world. Whether computer-supported cooperative “work” or “play,” as computing education and professions touch more areas of the world, and as world events contribute to ever-increasing multicultural communities, diversity challenges will only multiply. We find that constructionist computing education, accompanied by good pedagogical support, can be a site for effective intercultural learning and collaboration, but also that numerous challenges and pitfalls remain, many only partially addressable through efforts at better technical and pedagogical practice and design. Rather than seeking to overcome or ‘solve’ such difficulties, future efforts in this space should learn to work creatively with and within these limits, approaching the inevitable frictions, breakdowns and gaps that accompany the work of intercultural learning as resources to be drawn on, leveraged, and deployed."
A Forensic Qualitative Analysis of Contributions to Wikipedia from Anonymity Seeking Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359155,"By choice or by necessity, some contributors to commons-based peer production sites use privacy-protecting services to remain anonymous. As anonymity seekers, users of the Tor network have been cast both as ill-intentioned vandals and as vulnerable populations concerned with their privacy. In this study, we use a dataset drawn from a corpus of Tor edits to Wikipedia to uncover the character of Tor users' contributions. We build in-depth narrative descriptions of Tor users' actions and conduct a thematic analysis that places their editing activity into seven broad groups. We find that although their use of a privacy-protecting service marks them as unusual within Wikipedia, the character of many Tor users' contributions is in line with the expectations and norms of Wikipedia. However, our themes point to several important places where lack of trust promotes disorder, and to contributions where risks to contributors, service providers, and communities are unaligned. Building on a number of existing methodologically approaches, we propose a new qualitative methodology—forensic qualitative analysis—that extends existing methods to provide us with an understanding of the behavior and intent of people who cannot or will not participate in more direct research techniques. Using this technique, we contribute to our understanding of a very difficult-to-observe population. We construct our field site around the contributions of individuals protecting their privacy through Tor and the responses of the community to these contributions. Building on prior work that examined the degree to which Tor-based contributors act in good faith and make contributions that are non-damaging, we use our new methodology to establish a series of themes. We found that Tor-based contributors make quotidian, good-faith, non-damaging contributions to building the encyclopedia. They use policies to uphold quality and use platform affordances to collaborate with others with varying degrees of success. We also found that they violate policies in ways that damage the quality of the resource: they vandalize, harass, and participate in edit wars. Although anonymity seemed incidental or important in many of the types of contributions we examined, it appeared to play a critical in making the contributions possible in others. We saw examples of activists challenging power structures who may have had good reasons for seeking to protect their privacy. Resources which seek to reflect all the world’s knowledge may have good reason to embrace those who would champion perspectives outside the status quo that might not be heard in the absence of strong anonymity protection. With the deeper look afforded by forensic qualitative analysis, our results suggest that anonymity seekers may add additional value to peer production projects through their work on controversial topics as well as through their ability to challenge prevailing power structures. Our work also suggests that the risks to communities of allowing anonymous contributions may vary enormously. Indeed, different contributors and communities may value particular contributions differently when weighing them against these risks. We saw many examples of both productive and unproductive engagement through Tor and believe, from the context that were able to gather, that at least some of both types of edits would never had occurred if Tor were blocked completely. Myagmar et al. [36] suggest four alternatives for managing risk: accept, transfer, remove, and mitigate. Wikipedia initially accepted participation from Tor before following a strategy of removal with progressively effective techniques. New technology such as automated filtering systems and damage detection capabilities may allow communities to pursue a mitigation strategy in the future. We believe that our findings provide evidence in support of mitigation-based approaches that attempt to maximize value while minimizing damage. We also believe our work can provide some insight into the nuanced ways that value may flow into peer production communities from anonymity seeking users that we hope will inform these approaches in the future."
Restoration Work: Responding to Everyday Challenges of HIV Outreach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359156,"There has been a growing commitment across the fields of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction for Development (HCI4D) towards investigating the design and deployment of technologies in the context of complex healthcare ecologies. We present a qualitative inquiry of one such context, as we examine the outreach practices and everyday challenges of workers at a community-based organization in Gujarat (India) that works with People Living with the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus(PLHIV). Drawing on Yosso's framework of community cultural wealth-apt for such intersectional settings-and the lens of articulation work, we describe how the workers at Vikas build and strengthen varied forms of capital to restore ""old normals,"" or what life was like for their PLHIV clients prior to diagnoses. Finally, we propose that attention to this nature of restoration work, and the workers' engagement with diverse forms of community cultural wealth, allows us to reflect on how technologies might (or might not) be designed to impact social and affective aspects of health. We conducted a field study of the everyday practices and challenges of HIV outreach workers employed by Vikas, a community-based organization in Surat, Gujarat (India). We investigated the intersectional realities of the contexts they operate in, as they aim to restore “old normals” or life before diagnosis for PLHIV. By focusing on the articulation work performed by these workers, we learned that they not only aspire to address health conditions, but also attempt to facilitate restoration of various forms of capital of their HIV-positive clients. We drew attention to the spaces where technology might be of assistance to them (or not), through an examination of the ways in which they engage diverse forms of community cultural wealth [125]. Finally, we reflected on how a focus on restoration work might advance CSCW, HCI, and HCI4D research."
Moderation Challenges in Voice-based Online Communities on Discord,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359157,"Online community moderators are on the front lines of combating problems like hate speech and harassment, but new modes of interaction can introduce unexpected challenges. In this paper, we consider moderation practices and challenges in the context of real-time, voice-based communication through 25 in-depth interviews with moderators on Discord. Our findings suggest that the affordances of voice-based online communities change what it means to moderate content and interactions. Not only are there new ways to break rules that moderators of text-based communities find unfamiliar, such as disruptive noise and voice raiding, but acquiring evidence of rule-breaking behaviors is also more difficult due to the ephemerality of real-time voice. While moderators have developed new moderation strategies, these strategies are limited and often based on hearsay and first impressions, resulting in problems ranging from unsuccessful moderation to false accusations. Based on these findings, we discuss how voice communication complicates current understandings and assumptions about moderation, and outline ways that platform designers and administrators can design technology to facilitate moderation. While moderation is commonplace in online communities where moderators can remove, edit, and annotate content, change in technology can break down our assumptions and challenge our understandings of moderation by making these actions invalid. This study, through the lens of voicebased communities, examined new rules and new ways to break them through voice communication, and moderators’ challenges without the tools that they used to take for granted. We found that not only did the moderators have a hard time enforcing the rules, proving that a rule violation even happened was also a challenge for them. While recording may be a desirable solution, our findings pointed out that voice-only recording was not enough because moderators were not able to link members’ unique voice to their identities. Furthermore, the vague platform policies on recording may subject the volunteer moderators to legal ramifications. We argue that platform designers and administrators should carefully consider the impact of technological infrastructure on communities that they host, and develop technology and policies that provide moderators ample support and protect them from unexpected harm caused by the technology."
Dissonance Between Human and Machine Understanding,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359158,"Complex machine learning models are deployed in several critical domains including healthcare and autonomous vehicles nowadays, albeit as functional blackboxes. Consequently, there has been a recent surge in interpreting decisions of such complex models in order to explain their actions to humans. Models which correspond to human interpretation of a task are more desirable in certain contexts and can help attribute liability, build trust, expose biases and in turn build better models. It is therefore crucial to understand how and which models conform to human understanding of tasks. In this paper we present a large-scale crowdsourcing study that reveals and quantifies the dissonance between human and machine understanding, through the lens of an image classification task. In particular, we seek to answer the following questions: Which (well performing) complex ML models are closer to humans in their use of features to make accurate predictions? How does task difficulty affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans? Are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image recognition more accurate? Our findings have important implications on human-machine collaboration, considering that a long term goal in the field of artificial intelligence is to make machines capable of learning and reasoning like humans. In this paper, we focus on juxtaposing human understanding in an image recognition task with that of machines in two central scenarios of human decision making – selection of discriminative segments in an image and object recognition. We conducted a large-scale crowd sourcing study entailing 7,000 HITs with an aim to further the understanding of dissonance between humans and machines in the image classification task. To this end, we proposed novel metrics to measure the dissonance between humans and 3 state-of-the-art neural network models (Inception, ResNet, VGG). Our findings suggest that human perception of feature importance (i.e., the selection of discriminative segments in Task-1) does not consistently result in better human image recognition (in Task-2) in comparison to that by the neural network models considered in this work. We found that the models that are close to human understanding also generalise better. Our experimental evidence shows that humans are not always able to effectively exploit the use of context towards determining good features (i.e., discriminative segments in images). We also found that image difficulty is directly correlated with the effort in recognising objects irrespective of human or machine selected features. Finally, we release our entire dataset consisting of the two-stage crowd sourced tasks, complete with annotations from crowd workers for evaluation of image classification models. Our experiments in this paper shed light on the value that such a dataset and task design can bring to the CSCW and HCI community in furthering the understanding of human-machine dissonance. For example we unearth the fact that over-parametrized models like VGG tend to be more robust even if they are not the best performing models in case of easy images. We resonate that building more human-like machines can result in their seamless integration into our everyday lives, through interactions including collaboration and cooperation. In our future work we will delve into investigating the dissonance between humans and machines (i) when they both make the same error (‘are machines wrong for the right reasons?’) which is key in critical domains like health and defence and (ii) in other tasks such as visual question answering, machine translation, document retrieval etc. We also aim to investigate effects of a closed domain assumption for image recognition and other classification tasks where the set of classes/labels are known to the assessor."
Infrastructuring Food Democracy: The Formation of a Local Food Hub in the Context of Socio-Economic Deprivation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359159,"This paper discusses what infrastructuring in participatory design can contribute to processes of food system democratisation. It presents almost two years of engagement with a community-based organisation in a socio-economically deprived neighbourhood in England with the aim of developing a local food hub. It documents how the collaborative work shifted from setting up an infrastructure to ongoing infrastructuring of an enabling environment to grow and sustain social innovation. While the former focused on a technological platform and a business to deliver inclusivity, customer experience, and marketing, the latter focuses on building lasting relationships on three levels: strengthening ties within the community-based organisation, offering social spaces to connect with the local community, and with other organisations by forming coalitions with mutual benefits. We contribute three design opportunities: First, in order to infrastructure the formation of publics around food initiatives, we need to design for relationship building. Second, we point to design implications for ethical aspirations, participation, and system transformation towards a food democracy. Finally, we reflect on the sustainability of infrastructuring and the role of designers to work towards independent infrastructures. Through a long-term and open-ended collaboration with a community centre, our ongoing work wants to infrastructure a civic food network in a socio-economically deprived community. After two years of work, we have documented a negotiation between researchers and partner organisations to shift the collaboration from setting up an infrastructure to infrastructuring an enabling environment for socio-material processes to grow and maintain the food hub. Understanding the food hub not just as an online platform and a pick-up point, but as a socio-material assemblage, a Thing, helped shaping the kind of action we engaged in. From initially focusing on lowering the barriers by improving access, providing a smooth customer experience and delivering professional marketing, we shifted to building new relationships and strengthening existing ties. This includes collaborating closer within an organisation that has a wide range of services and offers, offering social spaces for the community to connect over food, and developing mutually beneficial activities with other organisations, all contributing to forming publics around the shared matter of care, the food hub. Furthermore, the infrastructuring lens is useful to address some of the challenges CFNs face in their effort to work towards food democracy. By following a participatory action research approach that focuses on building relationships and supporting positive practices, we aim at responding to the problems of ethical consumerism. Equally, building relationships, as slow and laborious as it can be, helps to retain a sensitivity to the complexity of participants’ lives. Furthermore, while this food hub remains small so far, it is a replication and adaptation of other food hubs, and might help replications and adaptations elsewhere, all moving the overall idea of food democracy along. Critical for the long-term sustainability of the food hub, and possibly similar forms of social innovation, is to recognise the fragility of this Thing in its early stages, depending on key individuals to remain alive. While the designer and researcher can be an important driver, it is also important to engage in a long-term transition, in which a persistent infrastructure is created and maintained that is owned and directed by local actors. For our future work or other food democracy infrastructuring work in socio-economically deprived areas, we point to the importance of both infrastructure work (as in technical systems and operational processes) and social processes on the ground to start a civic food network. Ideally, both should happen in parallel and intertwined, but due to issues of complexity and resources this might not always be possible. In our case, the infrastructure came first, given the drive from suppliers and the community centre. Having an actual infrastructure in place can also serve as a starting point for discussions and help with the community engagement. In other cases, this might happen the other way around. For community engagement to be successful, we recommend a sensitive and multi-faceted approach that offers many different ways for people to engage. Given how context-specific the form CFNs take can be, there cannot be one approach to it. Critically, whatever activities might be developed, they should be co-designed with the community from the start. Concluding, we believe that infrastructuring can be a fruitful approach to go about working towards food democracy. In turn, we can learn from food democracy to develop a sensitivity to the complex entanglement of ethical aspirations, challenges to participation, and opportunities for system change."
An Empirical Study of How Socio-Spatial Formations are Influenced by Interior Elements and Displays in an Office Context,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359160,"The design of a workplace can have a profound impact on the effectiveness of the workforce utilizing the space. When considering dynamic social activities in the flow of work, the constraints of the static elements of the interior reveals the adaptive behaviour of the occupants in trying to accommodate these constraints while performing their daily tasks. To better understand how workplace design shapes social interactions, we ran an empirical study in an office context over a two week period. We collected video from 24 cameras in a dozen space configurations totaling 1,920 hours of recorded activities. We utilized computer vision techniques, to produce skeletonized representations of the occupants, to assist in the annotation and data analysis process. We present our findings of socio-spatial formation patterns and the effects of furniture and interior elements on the observed behaviour of collaborators for both computer-supported work and for unmediated social interaction. Combining the observations with an interview of the occupants' reflections, we discuss dynamics of socio-spatial formations and how this knowledge can support social interactions in the domain of space design systems and interactive interiors. This an exploratory study to investigate the influence of spatial characteristics on socio-spatial formations. We captured a rich array of social arrangements exhibited in a office environment for two weeks with corresponding occupants’ space perceptions. We analyzed collected data using Skeletonographer, that we implemented to generate skeletonized representations, and to play back and annotate skeleton data. Our findings revealed that desk sizes, desk configuration, walls, partitions, and sitting and standing status contribute to different preferred socio-spatial formations during unmediated discussions, while the type and ownership of displays have more significant influence during computer-mediated social interactions. We also found that socio-spatial formations change over time to maintain ergonomic and social comfort in long-term interactions. Based on these findings, we propose that future office space designers could plan desired socio-spatial formations at a given space while arranging interior elements to maximize social comfort. We also suggest that this knowledge can inform opportunities for space planning and analysis tools as well as interactive furniture in the future."
Privacy Perceptions and Designs of Bystanders in Smart Homes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359161,"As the Internet of Things (IoT) devices make their ways into people's homes, traditional dwellings are turning into smart homes. While prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. Our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. We conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. We identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). We highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. We discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes. Prior literature in smart home privacy has focused on end-users, leaving other potential stakeholders, such as bystanders, understudied. In this study, we focus on smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners/users of these devices but can potentially be involved in the use of such devices. We aim to understand bystanders’ privacy perceptions in various contexts and their desired ways to mitigate their privacy concerns. Through six focus groups with 18 participants, our study results in a number of contextual factors that can potentially influence bystanders’ privacy perceptions of smart homes. In addition, we also identify a set of design factors that the bystanders consider in their desirable privacy mechanisms to address their concerns. These factors can further be categorized into two types, i.e., cooperative mechanisms and bystander-centric mechanisms. Our research highlights bystanders’ needs for privacy and some means of controls, the tension between smart homeowners/users and bystanders, as well as how cooperative mechanisms can be used to better support and balance the needs of both groups. We propose several concrete design suggestions based on our results, i.e., having both owners/user-oriented apps and bystander-oriented apps in smart home platforms."
Circadian Rhythms and Physiological Synchrony: Evidence of the Impact of Diversity on Small Group Creativity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359162,"Circadian rhythms determine daily sleep cycles, mood, and cognition. Depending on an individual's circadian preference, or chronotype (i.e.,""early birds"" and ""night owls""), the rhythms shift earlier or later in the day. Early birds experience circadian arousal peaks earlier in the morning than night owls. Prior work has shown that individuals are more effective at analytic tasks during their peak arousal times but are more creative during their off-peak times. We investigate if these findings hold true for small groups. We find that time of day and a group's majority chronotype impact performance on analytic and creative tasks. Physiological synchrony among group members positively predicts group satisfaction. Specifically, homogeneous groups perform worse on all tasks regardless of time of day, but they achieve greater physiological synchrony and feel more satisfied as a group. Based on these findings, we present and advocate for a temporal dimension of group diversity."
Hateful People or Hateful Bots?: Detection and Characterization of Bots Spreading Religious Hatred in Arabic Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359163,"Arabic Twitter space is crawling with bots that fuel political feuds, spread misinformation, and proliferate sectarian rhetoric. While efforts have long existed to analyze and detect English bots, Arabic bot detection and characterization remains largely understudied. In this work, we contribute new insights into the role of bots in spreading religious hatred on Arabic Twitter and introduce a novel regression model that can accurately identify Arabic language bots. Our assessment shows that existing tools that are highly accurate in detecting English bots don't perform as well on Arabic bots. We identify the possible reasons for this poor performance, perform a thorough analysis of linguistic, content, behavioral and network features, and report on the most informative features that distinguish Arabic bots from humans as well as the differences between Arabic and English bots. Our results mark an important step toward understanding the behavior of malicious bots on Arabic Twitter and pave the way for a more effective Arabic bot detection tools. In this paper, we have investigated the role of bots in spreading hateful messages on Arabic Twitter. We found that bots were responsible for 11% of hateful tweets in the hate speech dataset. We further showed that English-trained bot detection models deliver a moderate performance in detecting Arabic bots. Therefore, we developed a more accurate bot detection model trained on various sets of features extracted from 86,346 tweets disseminated by 450 manually-labeled accounts. Finally, we presented a thorough analysis of characteristics and behaviors that distinguish Arabic bots from English Bots and from humans in general. Our results facilitate future Arabic bot detection research in contexts beyond spread of religious hate."
Efficient Elicitation Approaches to Estimate Collective Crowd Answers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359164,"When crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. Unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. Despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. In this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. We investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. Annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. Estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. Our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. Instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. This resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). By analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. Our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ML training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions. This paper demonstrates that, when crowdsourcing the annotation of ambiguous data, we can reduce the cost of collecting reliable collective answer distributions by eliciting richer answers from each worker. We investigated answer elicitation approaches that vary along two dimensions: 1) annotation granularity and 2) the estimation perspective. Our results show that the choice of elicitation interface matters, and that the best (most efficient) solution is neither the fastest, nor the most potentially-accurate. Instead, we found that the best efficiency can be achieved using an intermediate-granularity approach that asks workers to select multiple labels that they estimate a group of other workers would choose. By analyzing when more fine-grained annotations are less accurate, we found that workers showed a tendency to estimate more heavily-skewed distributions when annotating weights than were actually observed in our ground truth data. While approaches that elicit fine-grained annotations did not result in the best performance when estimating collective answer distributions in our experiments, our work suggests that finding better ways to guide workers to estimate answer distributions by leveraging more fine-grained annotations is a promising future research direction."
"""When you can do it, why can't I?"": Racial and Socioeconomic Differences in Family Technology Use and Non-Use",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359165,"There is racial diversity as well as economic inequality in the United States (U.S.). To gain a nuanced understanding of how households from different socio economic and racial backgrounds integrate technology into their lives, we conducted a diary study with 22 parents who were Asian Indian (the fastest-growing immigrant population in U.S.) and 18 who were White American (the largest racial group in U.S.) parents from the working and middle classes. The participants logged in-situ instances of using smart phones and speaker use by, with, and around children for 8 weeks, and were interviewed once every four weeks (two times in total). Our findings reveal differences and similarities in parents' attitudes and practices of using or not using these devices around and with children, in parental restrictions of children's use of technology, and children's daily use patterns. The paper concludes with a discussions of the implications of our findings and suggestions for future design improvements in smart phones and speakers. In this paper, we present the findings from a diary study that extended over a period of eight weeks and involved 40 participants of different races (White and Asian Indian) and SESs (workingand middle-class). During this time, the participants logged daily in-situ instances of smart phone and speaker use by, with, and around children, and they were interviewed twice (once every four weeks). Our findings reveal differences between these groups in terms of technology (smart phone and speaker) use and practices in family settings, parental mediation, and parents’ non-use practices in the presence of children. Our study indicates that the conversational capabilities of smart speakers impact children’s use, and the parent’s perception of their children’s use, of these device. Furthermore, we found a need to improve the behavior of conversational devices in response to the rude or unacceptable behavior exhibited by children in their current use of them and a need to incorporate features that support the learning activities of children in the home setting. Finally, as families’ (non-)use of smart phones and speakers is highly variable (e.g., dependent on structural realities or family values) and contextual, we propose future designs that would incorporate a balance of user- and device-centered design principles to account for context."
Live Streaming as Co-Performance: Dynamics between Center and Periphery in Theatrical Engagement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359166,"Live streaming is a highly participatory form of performance, involving various types of audience participation such as liking, commenting, and gifting. But how do streamers and audiences collaborate to deliver live streaming performances? We approach this question through an interview study with 30 spectators and eight streamers in China. Drawing from theatrical engagement research, we use the cogitative spatial concept of center-peripheral attention of the audience to analyze the complex interplay between streamers and spectators, where the former occupy the center and the latter the periphery. We then discuss the orchestration of the center and the periphery, where streamers and spectators coordinate their respective performances, as well as the interaction between the center and the periphery, where the center-periphery distinction blurs. Based on these findings, we discuss co-performance as a theatrical metaphor for understanding live streaming and audience engagement. In this paper, we reported the phenomenon of co-performance in China’s live streaming sites. We analyzed co-performance through the lens of theatrical engagement, with a focus on the center-periphery duality. We found such duality to be a useful lens to analyze individuals’ live streaming channels because it acknowledges the intentionality and agency of streamers in deliberately managing their content and their spectators in order to deliver engaging performances, as well as the dynamic and scarce nature of audience attention. Audience participation contains an enormous potential to transform the power asymmetry between the streamers and the audience, but any analysis of live streaming should not overlook the fact that (most) live streaming platforms are for-profit and streamers must play the game of commercialization in order to sustain their content production. More research should be done in the future to understand: How the centerperiphery structure might be layered? What other theatrical metaphors could apply to live streaming, and in what way? How the center-periphery duality intersects with the particular cultural contexts of live streaming?"
"""I Think You'll Like It"": Modelling the Online Purchase Behavior in Social E-commerce",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359167,"Understanding the roles of social factors in online purchase behavior has been a long standing research problem. The recently emerging social e-commerce platforms leverage the stimulated word-of-mouth effect to promote the sales of items, which offers a peek into the complex interplay between the social influence and online purchasing behavior. In this paper, we investigate this problem on a full-scale purchase behavior dataset from one of the leading social e-commerce platforms, Beidian. Specifically, we conduct a comparison study between the social e-commerce and conventional e-commerce that are both integrated in Beidian to examine how social factors affect user's purchase behavior. We reveal that social e-commerce leads to a 3.09~10.37 times higher purchase conversion rate compared with the conventional settings, which indicates users make purchase with significantly fewer item explorations. Then, we propose and validate four primary mechanisms that contribute to the efficient purchase conversion: better matching, social enrichment, social proof and price sensitivity. Moreover, we identify several behavioral indicators that are able to measure the effect of these mechanisms, based on which we design an accurate predictive model (AUC=0.7738) for user's purchase decision. These results combine to shed light on how to understand and model the purchase behavior in social e-commerce. The recently emerging social e-commerce provides a unique opportunity to understand how social influences affect online purchase decisions. This work conducts a comparison study between the purchase behaviors in social and conventional e-commerce scenarios. We reveal that the purchase conversion rate in social scenario is 3.09∼10.37 higher than conventional scenario. Furthermore, we propose and validate four primary mechanism behind the efficient purchase conversion: better matching, social enrichment, social proof and price sensitivity. We demonstrate that behavioral indicators for the effect of these mechanisms can be extracted from user behavioral data, which facilitates the design of an accurate purchase prediction model. These results provide a novel angle to integrate the social features into the various forms of e-commerce platforms."
Higher Education Check-Ins: Exploring the User Experience of Hybrid Location Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359168,"A large body of literature is dedicated to understanding people's check-in behavior when they use location sharing services to pair their location with a venue, e.g., a restaurant, a park, etc. Check-in behavior in higher education settings, e.g., where students and instructors have academic purposes for check-ins, is under-studied. In this work, we explore how university students apply two different mechanisms, i.e., automatic and manual location-sharing services, to conduct check-ins for an academic purpose (i.e., students sharing their class attendance with their instructor). More specifically, a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon-based technology is applied to enable automatic class check-ins. We conducted two field trials with a total of 141 university students. Our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the use of auto and manual check-ins. Feedback from the student participants suggested that future higher education check-in systems may need to consider the integration of check-ins for a variety of purposes. Check-ins are extensively studied on social networks and limited work was conducted in the context of classroom check-ins in higher education settings. We designed and developed a check-in system with two mechanisms enabled and conducted two rounds of field trials with 141 university students. Our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the usage of auto check-ins (BLE beacon-based) and manual check-ins, and the use of manual check-ins promoted the adoption of auto check-ins. The findings also revealed unexpected barriers of adopting BLE beacon-based location sensing. In addition, we identified the needs and potential issues of integrating check-ins with different purposes. Our findings provide design implications for future check-in systems within and beyond the higher education context."
Cross-Cultural Differences in the Use of Online Mental Health Support Forums,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359169,"Online mental health forums facilitate supportive relationships between peers that transcend national and cultural boundaries. While past work in medical anthropology indicates a central role of cultural identity in how individuals frame their mental well-being and distress, little research has been done to investigate the role of culture in seeking and providing mental health support on online forums. Using data from two mental health forums, we analyze cross-cultural differences in mental health expression between people from different countries. We characterize these differences along three dimensions--identity, language use, and support behavior. Through comparing usage of the platform by individuals from three Asian countries with their counterparts from primarily Western countries, we find that individuals from these less-represented countries mention their own country more often when expressing distress, use fewer clinical language terms, and are more likely to provide support to people from the same country as them, as expected from past work on mental health in these countries. Contrary to past work, however, we find that the use of clinical mental health language is not affected over time by interacting with others in an international forum. While these findings are useful for understanding the role of culture in mental health support, they also have practical design implications for online forums. We find that the three dimensions of cultural differences we analyze are correlated with receiving effective support, and make design recommendations that can improve quality of support for the people in the minority on these forums. In this work, we show that there are cultural differences with regards to how people use online mental health support forums, that these differences extend to two different online mental health support forums, and that these differences matter with regards to how people from minority countries find support that successfully makes them feel better. Even with the norm of anonymity on these forums, we find that people still incorporate aspects of their cultural identity into how they use the forum, including mentioning their country of origin, using lower rates of clinical language, and supporting people from their country of origin. We also find that these factors, particularly the cultural homophily of a thread, are strongly related to whether the conversation will make the original poster feel better by the end of the conversation. Overall, these differences show the importance of considering culture, with a specific focus on cultural differences among users from minority groups, when designing inclusive online mental health spaces."
"Culturally-Embedded Visual Literacy: A Study of Impression Management via Emoticon, Emoji, Sticker, and Meme on Social Media in China",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359170,"Social media is often analyzed as a ""front stage"" where social media users perform their identities and manage impressions through various forms of user-generated content: text, picture, video, as well as visual expression such as emoticon, emoji, sticker, and meme. Previous scholarship has suggested various functions of visual expression in supporting computer-mediated communication. In this study, we move beyond the utility perspective to ask what constitutes the literacy to utilize visual expression for impression management. Towards this goal, we conducted an interview study with 30 social media users in China. We found that visual literacy intersects with its cultural context. Our interviewees used text and visual expressions in sophisticated, skillful ways and tailored for different audiences in order to construct desired images. They also interacted with audience memory in order to perform their uniqueness and creativity. Lastly, we discuss culturally-embedded visual literacy and provide implications for design. In this work, we reported an empirical account of visual expression use in China. We analyzed visual literacy’s role in participants’ impression management practices on social media. By analyzing how participants skillfully managed dialogical context and audience, we discuss visual expression use as a deliberate, learned skill, a reflection of offline social positioning. Our work could lead to much more future work on the use of visual expression in the construction of online identity, visual expression’s connection to both online and offline contexts, as well as a fuller account of what constitutes visual literacy."
How Emotional and Contextual Annotations Involve in Sensemaking Processes of Foreign Language Social Media Posts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359171,"The goal of this paper is to investigate how computational tools to annotate communication can support multilingual sense-making on social media. We conducted a field study of SenseTrans, a browser extension that uses sentiment analysis and named entity extraction techniques to annotate Facebook posts with emotional and contextual information. Interviews with 18 participants who used SenseTrans in their Facebook newsfeed for two weeks suggest that the annotations often supported sensemaking by providing additional information they could use to get a quick gist of the posts or to supplement their own interpretations. Participants varied in the extent to which they were motivated to evaluate the credibility of and form mental models of how the annotations were generated, which shaped how they utilized the annotations for sensemaking. Our findings demonstrate the value of designing to support cross-lingual communication and inform design implications for intelligent tools that support communication and sensemaking. The goal of this paper is to investigate how computational tools to annotate communication can support multilingual sensemaking on social media via an in the wild field evaluation study of SenseTrans. Our findings indicated that providing additional annotation could help people’s sensemaking processes and outcomes by helping them increase their understanding of and quickly get the gist of foreign language posts. This, in turn, made them more confident about and willing to engage with those posts, providing them with opportunities to gain deeper cultural learning and increased connectedness with their foreign connections. However, these benefits are only likely to be realized when participants formed appropriate credibility judgments and effective mental models of the annotations, and when the annotations matched their social media use goals. Overall, our findings demonstrate the value of designing to support cross-lingual communication and inform design implications for the tools that support cross-lingual communication and sensemaking with algorithmically generated information."
"""Am I Never Going to Be Free of All This Crap?"": Upsetting Encounters with Algorithmically Curated Content About Ex-Partners",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359172,"Every day on social media, people see streams of content curated by algorithms that leverage their relationships, preferences, and identities. However, algorithms can oversimplify the complexity of people's social contexts. Consequently, algorithms can present content to people in ways that are insensitive to their circumstances. Through 19 in-depth interviews, our empirical study examines instances of contextually insensitive content through the lens of people's upsetting encounters with content about their ex-romantic partners on Facebook. We characterize the encounters our participants had with content about their exes, including where on Facebook it occurred, the types of social connections involved in the content, and participants' perceptions of why the content appeared. Based on our findings, we describe the ""social periphery""---the complex social networks and data that enable inferred connections around otherwise explicit relationships---and discuss the design challenges that the periphery presents designers. As the work of content curation on social media continues to shift from people to algorithms, understanding how people experience what those algorithms make visible is critical to the design of human-centered systems—especially when the results are upsetting or harmful. Through the lens of breakups, this study examined scenarios where people unexpectedly encountered upsetting algorithmically curated content about their ex-partners on Facebook. We found these encounters happened in various places on the platform and were caused when curation algorithms could not account for people’s complex social contexts. This work contributes a deeper understanding of the risks and consequences of algorithms that prioritize connecting people without accounting for their social contexts, and design implications for representing relationships on social platforms. Designing algorithms that are sensitive to our social lives may remain a persistent challenge. Algorithms, whether optimizing our search results or ranking content in our social media feeds, are limited by the features and data made available to them. However, social media content derives its value from the social context in which that content is situated—context that may not be available to the system or understandable to an algorithm. Our findings point to areas where algorithms can be improved, notably when it comes to accounting for the social peripheries around romantic relationships. We argue that system designers cannot afford to abdicate the responsibility of algorithmically curated aspects of their systems to data models and back-end code, and that they should consider the difference between how human relationships are computationally represented and how they are practiced in real life."
Including the Voice of Care Recipients in Community Health Feedback Loops in Rural Kenya,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359173,"Community health programs in low-resource settings (like rural Kenya) aim to provide essential health services to vulnerable populations. However, to date, there has been limited research that explores the design of mechanisms that enable care recipients to provide feedback regarding their satisfaction with the services they receive. Such feedback has the potential to increase the motivation of community health workers (CHWs), enhance training procedures, detect fraudulent behavior, and inform key performance indicators for health programs. Our paper explores the design and deployment of a USSD-based system that allows anyone who possesses a basic mobile phone to provide feedback regarding the health services and quality of care they received from a CHW or during a hospital visit. Our system was designed through iterative fieldwork in rural Kenya that engaged with multiple stakeholder groups, including care recipients, CHWs, and high-level decision makers. After designing and testing the system, we deployed it for seven weeks in Siaya, Kenya, collecting both quantitative system usage data and qualitative data from six focus groups with 42 participants. Findings from our deployment show that 168 care recipients engaged with the system, submitting 495 reports via USSD. We discuss the broader factors impacting deployment, including the feasibility of USSD, actionability of feedback, scalability, and sustainability. Taken together, our findings suggest that USSD is a promising approach for enabling care recipients to submit feedback in a way that balances privacy, equity, and sustainability. This paper explored the design and deployment of a USSD system that enables care recipients to provide feedback about the health services they receive. Our design approach highlighted the importance of incorporating the views of multiple stakeholder groups. Quantitative and qualitative data from our seven week deployment showed that 168 care recipients engaged with the system and submitted 495 reports via USSD, suggesting that USSD is a viable mechanism for a beneficiary feedback system. We also discussed a range of sociotechnical challenges that arose during our study as we explored the feasibility, equity, privacy, and sustainability of using such a system to provide vulnerable populations with a voice in their own community health programs."
Reliability and Inter-rater Reliability in Qualitative Research: Norms and Guidelines for CSCW and HCI Practice,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359174,"What does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? What about when writing an auto-ethnography? When is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (IRR)? Reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. In this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: ""should I calculate IRR?"" Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research. Qualitative research is a rich and powerful way to understand the world around us. Yet, we have demonstrated that in CSCW and HCI, there is little consensus about how to approach reliability in qualitative research. As a result, authors often struggle to communicate methodological choices with confidence and reviewers may communicate confusing expectations. As researchers, we might expect that epistemological stances dictate methodological choices; however, in practice, other forces like perceived norms and reviewer variance may play a role. Our descriptive analysis of recent papers finds that most qualitative CSCW and HCI papers code data as part of their research process and most provide some description of the method they use to do so. Far fewer report the number of coders involved in the process and even fewer use IRR. Justifications for these choices are sparse. We argue that diverse epistemological standpoints in CSCW and HCI support these diverse uses, but that the community could be clearer about communicating the rationale for methodological choices. Further, there is variability in how terms and concepts are used, and although implemented in similar ways, they can be used differently and toward different ends. It is precisely these differences that necessitate thorough descriptions of methods and analytical process. Through our analysis and discussion, we examine a wide range of research cases, more experiences and situations than perhaps any one researcher is likely to have encountered in their own practice. Finally, we discuss considerations for best practices in writing methods and provide a set of recommendations for when researchers should seek agreement in qualitative research and when it is not needed, or even potentially harmful. In sum: there is no one correct way to approach reliability in qualitative research. Different epistemologies invite different frames; we hope that this work serves as a generative starting point for researchers to reflect on their epistemological goals and how they produce knowledge."
'Routine Infrastructuring' as 'Building Everyday Resilience with Technology': When Disruption Becomes Ordinary,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359175,"Getting a divorce. Being diagnosed with a disease. Going through a relationship breakup. Living through a natural disaster. All of these events are often life disrupting and debilitating. While some disruptive events are short-lived, some can be a routine part of everyday life. This leads to the question of how people who experience prolonged disruption in their lives build resilience---that is, how do they manage and overcome such events? To explore this question, this paper utilizes a case study approach to explore the use, creation, and re-appropriation of technology across three prolonged disruptions-the Second Gulf War in Iraq, veteran transitions, and the coming out experiences of LGBTQ-identifying people. Using a conceptual frame that brings together routine dynamics and infrastructuring, we find that engaging in routine infrastructuring practices generated resilience in people's daily lives---a phenomenon we dub 'routine infrastructuring' as 'building everyday resilience with technology.' We then theorize properties of infrastructure and infrastructuring practice that enable resiliency, and conclude with how infrastructuring is a form of care work that is oriented towards individuals, communities, and society. Whereas we have, in this study, started to more systematically uncover how technology helps people build resilience when experiencing prolonged disruptions to their daily lives, there is still a lot of work to be done in an effort of more deeply and broadly understanding and explicating the relationship between technology and resilience. Thus far, this paper has explored ways in which marginalized populations and those experiencing prolonged disruption benefit from routine infrastructuring. However, as CSCW and CHI scholars, we are engaged in a community who is focusing more and more on the marginalized, who are by definition already vulnerable in myriad ways. Importantly, infrastructures—in this case, socio-technical systems—can serve to further marginalize people, as they are designed by people with certain values and perspectives. It is crucial, then, that we consider the moral and ethical implications of the invisible work people do when infrastructuring, as these infrastructures become embedded in the routine lives of those who use them. To frame this conversation, we draw on scholarship from feminist and gender studies which seeks to explicate the interrelationship between technology use and design, and its societal implications [4, 5, 20]. Specifically, scholars are beginning to draw on the concept of care work [6, 14, 74] when thinking about the moral and ethical invisibility of technology. Care work has traditionally been used to think about the moral and ethical implications of the invisible work people do to make systems, such as families, maintain momentum in their everyday lives [14, 74]. In our study, we find that when people infrastructure resilience, they are, for the most part, infrastructuring everyday care. Initially, when people routinely engage in infrastructuring, infrastructuring is geared towards caring for the self and/or their families and/or communities. Over time, ultimately, infrastructuring was geared more towards caring for society. For example, in the context of our LGBTQ case study, people initially wrote narratives to reflexively understand themselves; they then turned towards helping others in their community; and finally, they started infrastructuring as a means of pushing back against harmful heteronormative structures. While routine infrastructuring has great potential to be used for social good, it also has the potential to harm. That is, as people try to mitigate the impacts of the everyday disruptions they face, the infrastructuring practices and subsequent socio-technical infrastructures they develop can impact people in potentially adverse ways. For example, in our Iraq case study, we observed how although people did benefit from the use of community generators, not all the providers of said generators may have necessarily had the social good in mind. These types of situations also inherently hold the potential to create more power differentials within society, as those who can afford generators and fuel gain power and economic advantage over others who need their services. As designers of socio-technical systems, it is imperative that as we develop and study socio-technical infrastructures, we continue to deeply consider both the invisible positive aspects in addition to ethical and moral dilemmas that may arise, as a form of community care work, while simultaneously thinking about how we can build socio-technical systems that promote resilience, and thus caring for others."
Collaboration Drives Individual Productivity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359176,"How does the number of collaborators affect individual productivity? Results of prior research have been conflicting, with some studies reporting an increase in individual productivity as the number of collaborators grows, while other studies showing that the free-rider effect skews the effort invested by individuals, making larger groups less productive. The difference between these schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their efficiency. We address this question by studying two planetary-scale collaborative systems: GitHub and Wikipedia. By analyzing the activity of over 2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics: the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but saturates at larger sizes. This effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the individual level. People tend to do more when collaborating with more people. We propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the non-linearity in collaboration effort. The proposed model is able to explain and predict group work dynamics in GitHub and Wikipedia by capturing their maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a principled, data-driven science of collaboration. Identifying the universal principles which apply to group productivity appears to be within the interest of various scientific disciplines. The complexity of human interactions and the heterogeneity of groups in terms of types and purposes makes this quest particularly challenging. Prior research demonstrates multiple conflicting results about the relationship between group size and productivity. In our attempt to untangle certain principles of collaborative work, we analyzed GitHub, a Webbased collaboration platform for software projects and Wikipedia, online encyclopedia. First we identify some limitations of our work and then we summarize our main findings and contributions. We acknowledge that our results on collaborative work should not be unconditionally generalized across domains. The data used in the study is collected from two different platforms: GitHub, used mostly by people who work in software development and Wikipedia which attracts users of many various interests. Each platform imposes its norms and dictates particular behaviors which can trigger domain-specific communication and work patterns. The groups in other work setups could exhibit a different behavior, hence one should be cautious about the absolute generalization of the provided results. The definition of productivity varies among disciplines and authors. However, we equate the productivity with the amount of work, ignoring the nuances such as the time invested or the actual value of work. We used data covering more than 40 million actions performed by 2 million users working on 4.7 million projects on GitHub and 23 million edits performed by 700 thousand users on 2.6 million pages on Wikipedia. We explore the super-linear relationship of productivity as a function of number of collaborators on a project and show that adding a new collaborator in a group is often beneficial. An additional collaborator boosts the average work in a group, suggesting a synergistic nature in groups that causes users to perform significantly better than when working individually. We show that the productivity of a group as a whole is the result of increased productivity of all individual members, and not simply due to the presence of a few super-performing individuals. The heterogeneity and high variance of users’ productivity makes it difficult to claim that the above phenomenon is more than an aggregate behavior and holds at the individual user level. However, by exploiting the fact the users work on multiple projects, we are able to demonstrate that people are more productive in larger groups. Given the choice to work on multiple projects, people put more effort into projects with more collaborators. The relation between group size and individual invested work is positive across all observed group sizes and it is particularly strong when the groups are still relatively small. For larger groups, that relation becomes less prominent and approaches zero. Overall, our results show that there is a super-linear relationship, but it is characterized by decreasing scaling exponent as groups become larger. This shows that the high productivity in larger groups is not the artifact of a small fraction of highly-productive individuals, but rather the result of a more universal preference pattern. Besides the group size, we analyze a set of other factors which can drive user’s productivity. We use S3D, a version of regression tree algorithm, to find the most informative features. Then, we extend this analysis by quantifying the linear relationships between the invested work and corresponding confounds."
Should We Use an Abstract Comic Form to Persuade?: Experiments with Online Charitable Donation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359177,"This paper examines the use of the abstract comic form for persuading online charitable donations. Persuading individuals to contribute to charitable causes online is hard and responses to the appeals are typically low; charitable donations share the structure of public goods dilemmas where the rewards are distant and non-exclusive. In this paper, we examine if comics in abstract form are more persuasive than in the plain text form. Drawing on a rich literature on comics, we synthesized a three-panel abstract comic to create our appeal. We conducted a between-subject study with 307 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk on the use of abstract comic form to appeal for charitable donations. As part of our experimental procedure, we sought to persuade individuals to contribute to a real charity focused on Autism research with monetary costs. We compared the average amount of donation to the charity under three conditions: the plain text message, an abstract comic that includes the plain text, and an abstract comic that additionally includes the social proof. We use Bayesian modeling to analyze the results, motivated by model transparency and its use in small-sized studies. Our experiments reveal that the message in abstract comic form elicited significantly more donations than text form (medium to large effect size=0.59). Incorporating social proof in the abstract comic message did not show a significant effect. Our studies have design implications: non-profits and governmental agencies interested in alleviating public goods dilemmas that share a similar structure to our experiment (single-shot task, distant, non-exclusive reward) ought to consider including messages in the abstract comic form as part of their online fund-raising campaign. Inspired by a rich history in persuasive test messages construction and benefits of abstract comics in communication, this paper examined if the abstract comic form is more persuasive than the corresponding plain text in the context of encouraging participants to donate for charitable causes. We conducted a field study on Amazon Mechanical Turk with 307 participants. In the study, participants received one of the three persuasive messages designed to ask for a donation to the Organization of Autism Research, a persuasive text message, a three-panel comic strip, and a three-panel comic strip incorporating the idea of social proof, and made donation decisions with real money. We analyzed the results using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that allows for understanding effect sizes, as well are transparent and helpful in small-n studies. The results shows convincingly that the three-panel abstract comic is more persuasive than the text (a medium to large effect size = 0.59). We also show that while the comic with social proof increases the donation level over the comic without the norm, the effect size is very small (0.11) and the increase is not significant. To summarize, the comic form significantly increases donations over the plain text, but the presence of the norm is not effective. We caution that the result holds for single-shot, public goods tasks; the value of the social proof in the comic, for exclusive tasks with distant rewards such as exercise, or dieting needs future research. The main implication of our work is that non-profits and Governmental agencies ought to consider using abstract comic in their online campaign as they work to alleviate public goods dilemmas. We believe that these agencies can easily include the use of the comic form as part of their overall messaging strategy because the simplicity of the abstract comic form allows it to be easily synthesized and to additionally incorporate social proofs. As next steps, we plan to develop an algorithmic framework that automatically maps a person’s behavioral data (e.g. amount walked this week) to a three-panel persuasive comic. We also plan to conduct longitudinal field experiments with an emphasis on storytelling where individuals receive three-panel comics over time, and comics are connected with a storyline."
Understanding Expert Disagreement in Medical Data Analysis through Structured Adjudication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359178,"Expert disagreement is pervasive in clinical decision making and collective adjudication is a useful approach for resolving divergent assessments. Prior work shows that expert disagreement can arise due to diverse factors including expert background, the quality and presentation of data, and guideline clarity. In this work, we study how these factors predict initial discrepancies in the context of medical time series analysis, examining why certain disagreements persist after adjudication, and how adjudication impacts clinical decisions. Results from a case study with 36 experts and 4,543 adjudicated cases in a sleep stage classification task show that these factors contribute to both initial disagreement and resolvability, each in their own unique way. We provide evidence suggesting that structured adjudication can lead to significant revisions in treatment-relevant clinical parameters. Our work demonstrates how structured adjudication can support consensus and facilitate a deep understanding of expert disagreement in medical data analysis. In this work, we introduced a novel perspective on the problem of expert disagreement in medical data analysis using a structured form of collaborative adjudication to study the nature and dynamics of disagreement from a socio-technical perspective. We demonstrated the applicability of our approach in the context of medical time series analysis for sleep stage classification, and showcased how the structured data produced can facilitate a deep understanding of the diverse factors playing a role in generating and resolving disagreements, including expert background, data complexity, viewer settings and classification guidelines. Our proposed workflow for structured adjudication has implications for the design of decision support for clinical group decision making and for the collection of expert-labelled data in the context of other applications like computer-aided diagnosis."
"""Giving a little 'ayyy, I feel ya' to someone's personal post"": Performing Support on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359179,"Social media platforms offer people a variety of ways to interact, ranging from public broadcast posts, to comments on posts, to private messages, to paralinguistic interactions such as ""liking"" posts. In 2015, the commenting function ""replies"" was temporarily removed from Tumblr, providing a unique opportunity to study the deprivation of a standard social media feature. We administered a survey to investigate Tumblr users' perceptions and use of replies. Respondents reported that they used replies to simultaneously support others' performance and their own. Respondents compared replies to other digital interaction channels such as paralinguistic interactions, the sharing feature ""reblogs"", and ""direct messages"" (DMs), citing social considerations and norms around each. We used Goffman's performance theory to draw insights on the perceived semi-public / semi-private space of replies, which enabled users to perform supportive actions that did not belong in their main blogging identity frontstage but that were not backstage either. We discuss the limitation of performance theory to describe a presentation to a limited but unknown audience, and we describe how replies enabled new frontstages such as the delicate ramp up to the performance of intimacy in DMs. We discuss implications for performing support and identity on social media with audiences that are perceived as limited but are unknown. Social media post comments may seem inconsequential or redundant to other interaction channels at first glance, however, we found that comments were a critical channel for actions that simultaneously support others’ as well as one’s own identity performances. Post replies and threaded comments resolves the conflict of these conflicting goals by inhabiting a semi-public/private space on social media with a limited, uncertain audience. This stage allows for actions that differ from the most consciously-crafted fronstage actions, like adding to an exhibition broadcasted to one’s followers and sending the first DM in a new friendship, and from unselfconscious backstage actions, like messaging with an old friend. On social media, where people are both consumers and producers of content, our findings highlight the importance of designing not just for public and private, or for frontstage and backstage, but also for interstitial spaces where people can momentarily relax their own performances of identity in order to engage as supportive audiences for others."
Intentional Technology Use in Early Childhood Education,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359180,"Early childhood is a critical developmental period when children's experiences have lasting impacts on long-term outcomes. Thus, an evidence-based understanding of how technology can support early childhood education (ECE) classrooms promises to be disproportionately useful to children's long-term wellbeing. We conducted an observational study at ten child-care centers, complemented by interviews with teachers and directors. Using a Uses and Gratifications (U&G) perspective, we found that the gratifications teachers seek when they incorporate technology into the classroom cluster into six categories, such as encouraging technology literacy, regulating children's behavior, and supporting child autonomy. Using these themes, we contribute a set of design priorities for supporting this population. We also contribute an expansion of the U&G perspective to include: 1) gratifications resisted, to account for the ways in which teachers resist gratifying uses of technology, and 2) differentiation between direct gratifications and indirect gratifications to better describe technology use in collaborative contexts. Early childhood is a critical period when the introduction of technology can have long-lasting effects on a child’s growth and development. We applied the Uses & Gratifications Theory (U&G) to examine the situated ways in which technology is used in classrooms today (documented through classroom observations), and we further examined the gratifications teachers sought when they enacted these uses (documented through interviews). We found that teachers make intentional and thoughtful choices in how they use technology in the classroom, motivated by a concise set of common gratifications. The need to support child autonomy, introduce children to a technology-rich world, leverage technology to manage the classroom, among others, led to a vast array of creative and diverse usage scenarios, ranging from pretend play with discarded keyboards to carefully-curated playlists of music to signal transitions. By distilling the core driving factors that motivate teachers’ use, we outline a space of design possibilities–including child-curated music, technologies for dedicated purposes, and tools for child-driven data capture. We also show how U&G currently provides an incomplete picture of the ways in which teachers think about gratifications and translate them into usage behaviors. Thus, a further contribution of this work is an expansion of U&G to include gratifications resisted and direct/indirect gratifications. Through these new constructs, we hope to make this highly productive, and long-standing theory of greater use to CSCW and social computing researchers."
Love in Lyrics: An Exploration of Supporting Textual Manifestation of Affection in Social Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359181,"Affectionate communication, the conveyance of closeness, care, and fondness for another, plays a key role in romantic relationships. While the pervasive use of digital technology for communication limits affectionate interaction through nonverbal cues -- a major channel of expression in face-to-face settings, there have been few approaches which scaffold couples' romantic text conversations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel interactive system Lily which gives users inspirations to enrich their romantic expressions in text messaging. It first listens to users' original input and then recommends romantic lyrics holding the closest meaning in real-time during chats with partners. After a three-day empirical study, participants who are real-life couples reported that they not only received useful cues from Lily in terms of how to polish their affectionate expressions, but also learnt to enrich the conversation with topics enlightened by its recommendations. Based on our findings, we finally provide several design considerations for actual deployment of such an application. In this paper, we proposed Lily, an interactive system that allows users to refine their affectionate communications by suggesting similar, but richer expressions in real-time text messaging. We utilized romantic song lyrics as a data source to present recommendations. Lily first reads users’ original input and then it returns three recommendations in real-time, which are randomly selected among the top 0.1% with similar meanings. These are different expressions chosen from 18,777 lines of lyrics. Through a three-day empirical study, we found that Lily helps users get inspired to refine their affectionate expressions indeed, despite its suggestions being less adequate in instrumental conversation. It is reported that users can refer to Lily’s recommendations not just for enriching affectionate expressions, but also for augmenting the conversation with topics enlightened by its recommendations. In addition, we derived several design considerations from study results and participant feedback. We hope this work attracts more researchers to design systems which facilitate emotional communications between human subjects."
All Users are (Not) Created Equal: Predictors Vary for Different Forms of Facebook Non/use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359182,"Relatively little work has empirically examined use and non-use of social technologies as more than a dichotomous binary, despite increasing calls to do so. This paper compares three different forms of non/use that might otherwise fall under the single umbrella of Facebook ""user"": (1) those who have a current active account; (2) those who have deactivated their account; and (3) those who have considered deactivating but not actually done so. A subset of respondents (N=256) from a larger, demographically representative sample of internet users completed measures for usage and perceptions of Facebook, Facebook addiction, privacy experiences and behaviors, and demographics. Multinomial logistic regression modeling shows four specific variables as most predictive of a respondent's type: negative effects from ""addictive"" use, subjective intensity of Facebook usage, number of Facebook friends, and familiarity with or use of Facebook's privacy settings. These findings both fill gaps left by, and help resolve conflicting expectations from, prior work. Furthermore, they demonstrate how valuable insights can be gained by disaggregating ""users"" based on different forms of engagement with a given technology. Increasing attention has been paid to the myriad ways that people engage with, and disengage from, social technologies [9, 13, 14, 20, 49, 60, 62, 84–86, 93]. The results presented here demonstrate empirically that we should not, and perhaps cannot, treat all technology use as a single, monolithic category. This paper focuses on one technical mechanism (deactivation) to identify different types of non/use among Facebook “users.” It shows how various predictors (Facebook intensity [27], Facebook addiction [5], and privacy behaviors [19, 76, 91]) have different associations with each form of non/use. These findings build on prior work to advance our understanding of how each of these factors may predict increased or decreased likelihood of the forms of non/use considered here. Future work will likely benefit similarly by disaggregating among different types of people who might otherwise be grouped under the label of “user” [cf. 47, 60] to provide a more thorough understanding of our engagements with, and disengagements from, social technology"
Dark Patterns at Scale: Findings from a Crawl of 11K Shopping Websites,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359183,"Dark patterns are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users into making unintended and potentially harmful decisions. We present automated techniques that enable experts to identify dark patterns on a large set of websites. Using these techniques, we study shopping websites, which often use dark patterns to influence users into making more purchases or disclosing more information than they would otherwise. Analyzing ~53K product pages from ~11K shopping websites, we discover 1,818 dark pattern instances, together representing 15 types and 7 broader categories. We examine these dark patterns for deceptive practices, and find 183 websites that engage in such practices. We also uncover 22 third-party entities that offer dark patterns as a turnkey solution. Finally, we develop a taxonomy of dark pattern characteristics that describes the underlying influence of the dark patterns and their potential harm on user decision-making. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for stakeholders including researchers and regulators to study, mitigate, and minimize the use of these patterns. In this paper, we developed automated techniques to study dark patterns on the web at scale. By simulating user actions on the ∼11K most popular shopping websites, we collected text and screenshots of these websites to identify their use of dark patterns. We defined and characterized these dark patterns, describing how they affect users’ decisions by linking our definitions to the cognitive biases leveraged by dark patterns. We found at least one instance of dark pattern on approximately 11.1% of the examined websites. Notably, 183 of the websites displayed deceptive messages. Furthermore, we observed that dark patterns are more likely to appear on popular websites. Finally, we discovered that dark patterns are often enabled by third-party entities, of which we identify 22; two of these advertise practices that enable deceptive patterns. Based on these findings, we suggest that future work focuses on empirically evaluating the effects of dark patterns on user behavior, developing countermeasures against dark patterns so that users have a fair and transparent experience, and extending our work to discover dark patterns in other domains."
"""I feel like only half a man"": Online Forums as a Resource for Finding a ""New Normal"" for Men Experiencing Fertility Issues",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359184,"Infertility can place a significant burden on couples and individuals when trying to conceive. Approximately 20-30% of all cases of infertility are due to male-related factors. Whatever the cause of difficulty in conceiving, little is known about how men find support when dealing with fertility issues, or when or how online resources are being used. This paper reports on a qualitative study of anonymous online posts (N=603) from forums related to fertility that are used by men. We analysed this data using thematic analysis to understand how men are using online forums as a resource when experiencing fertility issues. We found that online forums play a valued role in facilitating connections between men experiencing an often stigmatised condition. These forums offer men accessible and private spaces which allow for more open discussion, helping them to make sense of their situation. We discuss our findings in relation to Genuis and Bronstein's model of finding a ""new normal"" and present our elaborated model of finding a ""new normal"" in the context of experiencing fertility problems. In this study we found that men are likely to use online forums when they encounter fertility difficulties when trying to conceive, but found little evidence of them being used to discuss general preconception health in the absence of concerns about infertility. The analysis of forum posts identified that men used online forums to look for information and health related advice about sperm health, investigations and diagnoses, and that the search for information is woven into discussions in which men also seek validation of decisions and reassurance that they are not alone whilst they are experiencing difficulties in trying to conceive. Men used online forums as safe spaces to discuss and share their feelings of internalised stigma with a community of like-minded people who could empathise and support them during this unanticipated emotionally difficult time. There is a need for men who are experiencing difficulties whilst trying to conceive to establish a “new normal”, often in relation to other men who are undergoing similar experiences. This enables them to understand the process and reduce self-blame caused by the internalised stigma. Online forums were used as a resource to bridge gaps in understanding once men experience the life disruption of infertility. Online users support sense-making and meaning-making in order to establish a sense of socially constructed “new normal” with their peers in the online community. Conversations were held between groups of like-minded men, which led to the normalisation of men’s involvement into the fertility journey, which could contribute to reducing the societal pressures of unequal gender balance in the domain of fertility. The study reported here extends our understanding of how men communicate with one another online when they experience fertility issues and of the unique role online forums play in facilitating connections, finding a “new normal” and providing a platform for men to discuss private, sensitive and sometimes stigmatised issues behind a screen of anonymity in a public online space."
