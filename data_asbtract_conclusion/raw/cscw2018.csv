Editors' Message,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274285,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to this issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction, the second to focus on the contributions from the research community Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW). This journal model allows for rapid publication of papers shortly after acceptance as well as enabling automatic indexing services, such as Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) indexing. The aim is to increase the visibility of the work of authors in this community, and allow for better comparability with fields outside of Computer Science. This issue contains papers accepted over two iterations of the review process. The call for papers for this second issue, with an initial deadline in Spring 2018, attracted 722 submissions, from all around the world. After the first round of reviewing, 326 (45,2%) papers were invited to the Revise and Resubmit phase. The program committee worked hard over August 2018 to arrive at final decisions, with an online editorial committee meeting held to allow for collective deliberation. In the end, 184 papers (25,5%) were accepted. For some of those papers, authors received further shepherding and guidance by a senior committee member. This shows the commitment of the CSCW community to not only ensure high quality contributions, but also to educate and enable authors to write and present their best work for this community. This issue exists because of the dedicated volunteer effort of 132 senior editorial committee members who served as Associate Chairs (ACs), and 837 external expert reviewers to ensure high quality and insightful reviews for all papers in both rounds."
Quotidian Report: Grassroots Data Practices to Address Public Safety,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274286,"We examine the local data practices of citizens in Mexico who use Facebook sites as a platform to report crimes and share safety-related information. We conducted 14 interviews with a variety of participants who collaborate as administrators and contributors of these online communities. The communities we examined have two central components: the citizens who crowd-source data about instances of crime in different neighborhoods in and around Mexico City, and the administrators of the Facebook sites who use the crowd-sourced data to intervene and collaborate with other stakeholders. From our interviews, we identify the community, data, and action practices used by group administrators to collect, curate, and publish information about public safety that would otherwise go unreported. The combination of these practices improves the reputation of the groups on Facebook, increases trust, and encourages sustained participation from citizens. These practices also legitimize data gathered by group members as an important grassroots tool for responding to issues of public safety that would otherwise not be reported or acted upon. Our findings contribute a growing body of work that aims to understand how social media enable political action in contexts where people are not being served by existing institutions. In this paper, we examined the local data practices of citizens in Mexico who use Facebook sites as a platform to report crimes and share safety-related information. We identified the community, data, and action practices used by site administrators to collect, curate, and publish data about public safety that would otherwise go un-reported. In order to build their communities, administrators first needed to attract the attention from inhabitants of the affected neighborhoods. Then, to keep the community growing, and to sustain meaningful engagement through posting and sharing information, they had to ensure that the information gathered was useful and helped the community act on the specific incidents reported. Through a qualitative analysis of interviews with a set of administrators, we were able to reflect on a set of common practices they developed in order to manage their locally-focused online communities, to cultivate data collection and curation within those communities, and to connect both to forms of action that would result in positive outcomes with respect to addressing violent crime. What we show establishes an initial understanding of how the affordances of Facebook in particular enable and constrain civic action to address violence and suggests direction for future work that will seek to overcome those limitations while acknowledging the pragmatic reality that commercial social media platforms will continue to dictate many of the terms of social engagement, even at a local level. This work contributes to a growing body of work that aims to understand how social media enable political action in contexts where people are not being served by existing institutions."
"Hackers, Computers, and Cooperation: A Critical History of Logo and Constructionist Learning",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274287,"This paper examines the history of the learning theory ""constructionism"" and its most well-known implementation, Logo, to examine beliefs involving both ""C's"" in CSCW: computers and cooperation. Tracing the tumultuous history of one of the first examples of computer-supported cooperative learning (CSCL) allows us to question some present-day assumptions regarding the universal appeal of learning to program computers that undergirds popular CSCL initiatives today, including the Scratch programming environment and the ""FabLab"" makerspace movement. Furthermore, teasing out the individualistic and anti-authority threads in this project and its links to present day narratives of technology development exposes the deeply atomized and even oppositional notions of collaboration in these projects and others under the auspices of CSCW today that draw on early notions of 'hacker culture.' These notions tend to favor a limited view of work, learning, and practice-an invisible constraint that continues to inform how we build and evaluate CSCW technologies. “And so it now is up to all of us to carry forth Seymour’s legacy—indeed an honorable calling for the IDC community,” Paulo Blikstein stated in the description of the 2017 Interaction Design and Children conference, which had the theme “Logo: The Next 50 Years.” He continued, “It is the legacy of creating for children environments where each will find the gears of their childhood.” Blikstein’s message resonates not only with those who experienced the Papert-heavy elements of the MIT Media Lab curriculum; we have seen that the ideals that constructionism was built on are ideals that still motivate the technology world more broadly. In particular, we have seen a strong alignment between constructionism and the ‘hacker ethic,’ and the deep convictions that gave rise to this ethos among the hacker community at MIT. Among other effects, this alignment likely meant that even in the face of contradictory evidence, Papert would not revise his theories. To do so would have entailed giving up an ethos that undergirded his professional, if not his personal, identity [7]. These parallels have also helped constructionism keep a strong presence in the technology world, where the ‘hacker ethic’ still resonates, even when some of its lessons fly in the face of best practices in human-computer interaction. Thus, constructionism is still celebrated at IDC, in design schools, and across CSCW and HCI—a logic further entrenched by decades of technology design centered on individualized ‘users.’ This paper has shown that the same forces that shaped constructionism also shape the ways that we tend to view computers and the nature of collaboration—and that this ‘hacker ethic’ still has purchase even when evidence points the other way. In so doing, it shows the importance of tracing the ideological histories of contemporary technology projects: these linkages take us back to previous waves of utopian thought that may seem quaint, but have often been translated into contemporary discourse with only cosmetic changes. It also offers an antidote to the allure of constructionism specifically, drawing back the curtain and discussing not only what is wrong with the learning theory, but why it continues to be captivating despite this. One contribution here, then, is not merely a critical history of constructionism, but an examination of some of the underlying forces that make some technology projects “charismatic” [4,7] even when they fail to deliver. Moreover, the ubiquity of these individualized, computer-centric perspectives can make it more difficult to envision alternatives for computer-supported collaboration—ones that encode pro-social behavior, mechanisms for countering power differences, or modes of social reciprocity, for instance—or even decenter the computer as a solution for social problems altogether. While the form of such systems is best left to future work, there are some good starting points for considering alternatives in the growing body of critical work on the technology industry. This scholarship details some of the consequences of the anti-authority, every-person-for-themselves, wild-west-like ethos of early computing communities like MIT’s hackers (though their utopianism has also been productive in some respects; see e.g. [7,26,126]). That the very logic of the ‘personal computer’ was one of individual empowerment rather than ceding agency to the machine [126] might have allowed us to more easily acquiesce to ceding our agency to algorithmic regulation [6,45,70]. For example, social media and other technology companies have upheld computers as a solution to social problems (e.g. [27]), even as many have abdicated responsibility for actively cultivating positive social spaces online by framing themselves as ‘platforms.’ We are increasingly suffering the consequences of this as these spaces are implicated in hate crimes, antisocial behavior, and even damage to democratic institutions and inclusivity [12,39,46,61,73,95,115]. Similarly, a plethora of technology-focused educational companies propose to replace public education with individualized learning, and privately-owned technology-centric charter schools have taken steps toward weakening this public institution and removing pathways of public accountability in education. Alongside this, middle-class parents fret about ‘screen time’ in a world where technology use is seen as antithetical to family togetherness and pro-social behavior (e.g. [2,9]). Even the industry’s tepid and individualistic reaction to institutionalized racism and sexism—where women are encouraged to simply “lean in” and hateful behavior is framed as “a few bad apples” or even “a problem of both sides”— indicates the depth of this ideological frame. A focus on transparency as a possible solution for some of these social problems within the technology world ignores the problematic interaction between transparency and power (e.g. [12,124]). This ‘solution’ is moreover individualistic and renders us all less receptive to the potentials for collective action to foment change—something toward which technology cultures within Silicon Valley in particular have long been hostile [17]. Still, I find hope in the increasing strength of social movements built on principles of collective action (including Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, Stand With Standing Rock, and Me Too/Time’s Up) which lean on technology platforms to amplify their messages—even if these platforms fail to protect them [125]. While these broader trends are not necessarily traceable directly to Papert and constructionism, they are all influenced by the same ideological forebears that made the values of early hacker culture so resonant, and could all benefit from some “troubling” [49] in order to plumb the smooth veneer of their utopian mythologies [4,7,34,72] and understand better how they play out in “the mangle of practice” [96], both historically and contemporaneously. These ideologies tend to favor limited, and limiting, perspectives on not only learning, but computer use more generally, and this constraint continues to inform how we build and evaluate technologies for collaboration and more. While constructionism’s ‘rugged individualism,’ often defined outside or even in opposition to institutions and social relations, is not unique to either the learning theory or to hacker culture, both do valorize it. Indeed, it reflects a primacy of individual over collective experiences that has defined the American cultural landscape for at least a century [7,10]. When American norms have played an outsized role in informing technology design, this atomization becomes at least legible (if not actually taken up) across the world—a dominance worth questioning. This paper examines some of the ideological foundations that brought us here as a first step in countering them."
"Testing Waters, Sending Clues: Indirect Disclosures of Socially Stigmatized Experiences on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274288,"Indirect disclosure strategies include hinting about an experience or a facet of one's identity or relaying information explicitly but through another person. These strategies lend themselves to sharing stigmatized or sensitive experiences such as a pregnancy loss, mental illness, or abuse. Drawing on interviews with women in the U.S. who use social media and experienced pregnancy loss, we investigated factors guiding indirect disclosure decisions on social media. Our findings include 1) a typology of indirect disclosure strategies based on content explicitness, original content creator, and content sharer, and 2) an examination of indirect disclosure decision factors related to the self, audience, platform affordances, and temporality. We identify how people intentionally adapt social media and indirect disclosures to meet psychological (e.g., keeping a personal record) and social (e.g., feeling out the audience) needs associated with loss. We discuss implications for design and research, including features that support disclosures through proxy, and relevance for algorithmic detection and intervention. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss. In this paper we investigate the important role of indirect disclosures on social media for women who have experienced pregnancy loss. We report on interviews with women in the United States who use social media and had experienced pregnancy loss, and make several novel contributions to HCI and social computing. We first contribute a typology of indirect disclosure strategies differentiating according to content obviousness, original content creator, and content sharer. We then contribute an understanding of perceived decision factors informing indirect disclosures of sensitive experiences across social media platforms. We find that perceived decision factors are related to the self, audience, platform and affordances, and time. In doing so, we extend the Disclosure Decision-Making Framework proposed in prior work to explain direct disclosures of stigmatized experiences on social media to a distinct disclosure behavior: indirect disclosures. We discuss how people intentionally appropriate indirect disclosures on social media to meet psychological and social needs associated with pregnancy loss. We suggest that indirect disclosures can be viewed as a strategy to avoid potential regretful experiences that may stem from direct sensitive disclosures. We also discuss implications for future research and systems. Future work should explore specific needs associated with indirect disclosures such as more anonymity, negotiation of emotional trust in social networks, proxy disclosures of sensitive information, and experiments with comment-controlled posts. We discuss implications of this work for algorithmic detection of distress and supportive interventions. In particular, we explore the possibility of detecting more subtle signals in addition to explicit, obvious, and direct disclosures in these algorithms. However, we also raise caveats about needs for privacy, anonymity, and control that may be at odds with such signal detection. The most helpful offerings may be aids that facilitate disclosure and opt-in, self-initiated support seeking and interventions."
Acting the Part: Examining Information Operations Within #BlackLivesMatter Discourse,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274289,"This research examines how Russian disinformation actors participated in a highly charged online conversation about the #BlackLivesMatter movement and police-related shootings in the USA during 2016. We first present high-level dynamics of this conversation on Twitter using a network graph based on retweet flows that reveals two structurally distinct communities. Next, we identify accounts in this graph that were suspended by Twitter for being affiliated with the Internet Research Agency, an entity accused of conducting information operations in support of Russian political interests. Finally, we conduct an interpretive analysis that consolidates observations about the activities of these accounts. Our findings have implications for platforms seeking to develop mechanisms for determining authenticity---by illuminating how disinformation actors enact authentic personas and caricatures to target different audiences. This work also sheds light on how these actors systematically manipulate politically active online communities by amplifying diverging streams of divisive content. This study examined the online activities of social media accounts affiliated with an organization that has been accused of functioning as part of the Russian government’s intelligence and media apparatus [61, 62]. We focus on the activities of these accounts—i.e. their information operations— within #BlackLivesMatter discourse during 2016, during the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election. Our research demonstrates how these accounts presented themselves as “authentic” voices on both sides of a polarized online discourse, modeling pro- and anti-BlackLivesMatter agendas respectively. We also show how these accounts converged to undermine trust in information intermediaries like ‘the mainstream media’. This work conceptually sheds light on how information operations use fictitious identities to reflect and shape social divisions. We conclude by highlighting both the need and the challenges of evaluating authenticity within social computing environments."
"With Few Eyes, All Hoaxes are Deep",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274290,"Quality control is critical to open production communities like Wikipedia. Wikipedia editors enact border quality control with edits (counter-vandalism) and new article creations (new page patrolling) shortly after they are saved. In this paper, we describe a long-standing set of inefficiencies that have plagued new page patrolling by drawing a contrast to the more efficient, distributed processes for counter-vandalism. Further, to address this issue, we demonstrate an effective automated topic model based on a labeling strategy that leverages a folksonomy developed by subject specific working groups in Wikipedia (WikiProject tags) and a flexible ontology (WikiProjects Directory) to arrive at a hierarchical and uniform label set. We are able to attain very high fitness measures (macro ROC-AUC: 95.2%, macro PR-AUC: 74.5%) and real-time performance using word2vec-based features. Finally, we present a proposal for how incorporating this model into current tools will shift the dynamics of new article review positively. In this paper, we describe a specific work context in Wikipedia that is struggling. Wikipedia, the open encyclopedia is less open today because the new article reviewers are overwhelmed. Through examining new article reviewer processes and comparing them to the more-efficient new edit review processes we were able to identify a critical gap: topic routing. In response, we built a topic model using an ontology and folksonomy developed and maintained by Wikipedians for organizing content by subject interest (WikiProjects). By combining this folksonomy and a set of already tagged articles, we were able to build a mid_level_categories mapping for training a prediction model. We used word2vec based embeddings to develop a powerful and efficient strategy for feature extraction of topic signal. Finally, we tested Random Forests, Gradient Boosting classifiers and SVMs to perform multilabel classification on this dataset and achieved a high level of fitness with both bag-of-words and word vectors. These models are fast and easy to train and use which makes them practical for deployment in a production/real-time environment like that of ORES, a machine prediction service that is already widely used by Wikipedians. Finally, we have proposed how our model and other models that are already deployed in production can be used to re-shape the new article review process in productive ways. Given the high level of fitness we were able to attain with basic binary classification methods, we leave the application of more advanced label dependence methods as future work. Further we encourage the readers to make use of our WikiProjects ontological abstractions and extend them to other domains for topic modeling. We suspect that the strict hierarchy of the WikiProjects directory along with the WikiProjects tagging can provide a very useful view into Wikipedia’s topic spaces where other research has struggled to use categories. Such an ontology could be very beneficial for ongoing work exploring Wikipedia’s topic coverage bias like that covered by Halfaker[7]."
Framing Effects: Choice of Slogans Used to Advertise Online Experiments Can Boost Recruitment and Lead to Sample Biases,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274291,"Online experimentation with volunteers relies on participants' non-financial motivations to complete a study, such as to altruistically support science or to compare oneself to others. Researchers rely on these motivations to attract study participants and often use incentives, like performance comparisons, to encourage participation. Often, these study incentives are advertised using a slogan (e.g., ""What is your thinking style?''). Research on framing effects suggests that advertisement slogans attract people with varying demographics and motivations. Could the slogan advertisements for studies risk attracting only specific users? To investigate the existence of potential sample biases, we measured how different slogan frames affected which participants self-selected into studies. We found that slogan frames impact recruitment significantly; changing the slogan frame from a 'supporting science' frame to a 'comparing oneself to others' frame lead to a 9% increase in recruitment for some studies. Additionally, slogans framed as learning more about oneself attract participants significantly more motivated by boredom compared to other slogan frames. We discuss design implications for using frames to improve recruitment and mitigate sources of sample bias in online research with volunteers. This is the first paper that examines how advertising online experiments, specifically through the use of slogan framing, attracts different populations. Our results suggest that slogans that incentivize participants with the benefit of learning something new about themselves, such as personalized feedback or social comparisons, can substantially increase recruitment compared to slogans appealing to participants’ motivation to support science. Additionally, different frames attract participants with different motivations: slogans advertising studies as learning more about oneself attracted participants most motivated by boredom. Our results provide new guidelines for researchers attempting to recruit online volunteers while mitigating sample biases."
Departing and Returning: Sense of Agency as an Organizing Concept for Understanding Social Media Non/use Transitions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274292,"Recent work has identified a variety of motivations for various forms of technology use and non-use. However, less work has closely examined relationships between those motivations and the experiences of transiting among these different forms of use and non-use. This paper fills that gap by conducting a qualitative interview- and diary-based study where participants were asked to deactivate their Facebook account. An abductive analysis suggests participants' experiences can be organized under the conceptual umbrella of sense of agency, which refers to an individual's perception that their actions are under their own control. The analysis shows how, across disparate motivations, all participants took actions that increased their own subjective sense of agency, regardless of whether they returned to Facebook or not. The discussion applies this conceptual lens to prior studies of technology use and non-use. Doing so shows how sense of agency may provide an organizing orientation for understanding subjective experiences of use and non-use. This paper presents analysis of qualitative data from an interview- and diary-based study of participants who took a break from Facebook by deactivating their accounts. In contrast to prior work, which provides primarily post-hoc accounts, this study allows for observation of the transitions among different types of non/use as those transition processes unfold. The findings show how, regardless of whether participants returned to Facebook or stayed off the site, they took actions that provided them with a greater sense of agency [26, 27, 53, 56]. Applying this conceptual lens to other prior work shows how a sense of agency provides a useful means of understanding and organizing disparate motivations that individuals cite for using or not using social technologies in various ways."
Efficient Crowd Exploration of Large Networks: The Case of Causal Attribution,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274293,"Accurately and efficiently crowdsourcing complex, open-ended tasks can be difficult, as crowd participants tend to favor short, repetitive ""microtasks"". We study the crowdsourcing of large networks where the crowd provides the network topology via microtasks. Crowds can explore many types of social and information networks, but we focus on the network of causal attributions, an important network that signifies cause-and-effect relationships. We conduct experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) testing how workers can propose and validate individual causal relationships and introduce a method for independent crowd workers to explore large networks. The core of the method, Iterative Pathway Refinement, is a theoretically-principled mechanism for efficient exploration via microtasks. We evaluate the method using synthetic networks and apply it on AMT to extract a large-scale causal attribution network. Worker interactions reveal important characteristics of causal perception and the generated network data can help improve our understanding of causality and causal inference."
#pray4victims: Consistencies in Response to Disaster on Twitter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274294,"This paper studies commonalities in response across disasters in online social networks (OSNs), specifically Twitter. After presenting an algorithm for extracting vocabularies across disasters, we extract type-specific vocabularies for terrorist attacks, earthquakes, and climate-related disasters between 2012 and 2017. Disaster type drives vocabulary similarity: terrorism responses mention an ""attack"" and law enforcement, earthquake responses mention the quake and its magnitude, and climate-related responses include safety and requests for aid. Across disaster types, tweets regularly mention victims/affected and prayer, consistent with communal coping and social support in crisis aftermath. Using disaster-type vocabularies, we study Twitter as a proxy for severity, correlating casualties to frequencies in Twitter. These vocabularies better correlate with casualties than baseline crisis lexica, especially in western countries. Twitter response and casualties diverge at the maximum, and Twitter response is stronger in Western countries, suggesting perceived severity is driven by additional factors. This paper explores public use of Twitter in response to disasters. We develop an algorithm for extracting commonly used vocabularies across a set of related disaster events and show several patterns are shared within each disaster category: responses to terrorism events often mention an “attack” and law enforcement; earthquake responses mention the quake and its magnitude in various languages; and climate-related disaster responses tend to include safety and requests for aid. Across all three types of disaster, Twitter users also regularly mention victims, the affected, and invocations of prayer, consistent with communication theory on communal coping and social support in the aftermath of crises. Using these disaster scripts, we test Twitter’s regional biases, results of which suggests Twitter response favors Western countries, and the most tragic days in terms of casualty do not align with impact on Twitter. While other work has studied Twitter response to disasters, this work provides a novel analysis into the lexical form and locations of these responses. These results have implications for emergency responders, aid organizations, and crisis informatics researchers, illuminating potential regional biases in Twitter and suggesting social support and solidarity behaviors are common across disasters and disaster types. This commonality suggests an underlying motivation may be present in driving indirectly affected populations to respond and engage with each other during times of stress."
Supporting Collaboratively Constructed Independence: A Study of Spinal Cord Injury,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274295,"Independence is a central concern for people in the care of many chronic conditions. It is often viewed as a goal that can be facilitated with the use of patient data. It is also viewed, especially from the medical side, as something an individual achieves. However, in the lived experience, independence is often a set of collaborative practices. In this paper, we unpack findings from an interview-based study of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) self-care. We found that independence - both functional and in the form of effecting agency - must be co-constructed by the choices and activities of the care network, including the person with disability, caregivers, and clinicians. This collaboratively shaped independence also affects potential collection and use of data in support of self-care. We describe how collaboratively shaped independence informs requirements and constraints for the design of sensor-based networks for self-care in long-term chronic disability. In this study, we examined self-care for individuals with spinal cord injuries. We found that independence is a central concern in SCI, and that it has two dimensions: learning and maintaining the physical capabilities to do activities without assistance and asserting a measure of agency over self-care decision making. Importantly, we found that independence is a collaborative construct, heavily influenced by the coordinated activities of the care network and its members’ approach to and active help in self-care. We also found that the care network is dynamic in terms of specific members, roles, and activities. The presence of a care network, its importance in maintaining both functional and agential independence, and the dynamic nature of the care network all influence the nature of data sharing and access from sensorbased systems. Moreover, because everyone in a care network must also weigh their independence, data provision is often not straight-forward. We found that sensor-based systems to provide data access and data flows must provide for user control over those flows. Our methodology had limitations. As we mentioned previously, recruitment was a challenge for us due to the nature of SCI. Recruitment efforts showed “study fatigue” experienced by individuals with disability because they are not infrequently asked to participate in studies. The difficulty and sensitive nature of the condition itself, as well as geographical dispersion, pose additional challenges. We also would have liked to interview more members belonging to the same care network. However, we found that recruiting a group of connected individuals is oftentimes more difficult; some people in the care network are willing to participate while others are not. We did not want to make this a condition for participation given the other challenges with recruitment. The inclusion of clinicians in the care network further adds HIPAA considerations (e.g., the individual with disability must first agree to participate and grant the clinicians permission to disclose information). We believe that the care network is an important unit of analysis, especially in long-term illness or disability, and how to recruit networks as participants to learn how to better support them is an important challenge for CSCW/HCI. However, we believe we recruited a reasonable crosssection of people with SCI, their caregivers, and clinicians. Our findings are also limited to the particular context we studied and are therefore not broadly generalizable. However, while the context of our study was SCI, we believe that similar kinds of concerns will exist in other chronic care situations. For instance, our supplemental interviews suggest that people with developmental disabilities, disability from stroke, and certain neuromuscular conditions that impose similar constraints and self-care needs have similar care networks and concerns of independence."
Investigating Crowd Creativity in Online Music Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274296,"Crowd creativity is typically associated with peer-production communities focusing on artistic products like animations, video games, and music, but less frequently to Open Source Software (OSS), despite the fact that also developers must be creative to come up with new solutions to their technical challenges. In this paper, we conduct a study to further the understanding of which factors from prior work in both OSS and art communities are predictive of successful collaboration - defined as reuse of previous songs - in three different songwriting communities, namely Songtree, Splice, and ccMixter. The main findings from this study confirm that the success of collaborations is associated with high community status of recognizable authors and low degree of derivativity of songs. In this paper, we applied mixed methods to investigate co-creation behavior in three online music communities and determine which success factors from prior research in both OSS and online creative communities are antecedents of reuse. Our findings show that, in line with previous findings from research on both OSS and creative communities, the perceived quality of an artifact in terms of users’ reactions and authors’ prominence heavily influences the choice to reuse an artifact. We also observed a loss of generativity and interest from other artists in songs that have been already reused. As for the authors’ popularity, we found that social status is used to signal to fellow artists the quality of artifacts, which in turn see an increase in generativity. Finally, we provided some suggestions about features that arts and OSS online communities may consider borrowing from each other."
MechanicalHeart: A Human-Machine Framework for the Classification of Phonocardiograms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274297,"Listening to heart sounds is an important first step in evaluating the cardiovascular system and is important in the early detection of cardiovascular disease. We present and evaluate a framework for combining machine learning algorithms, crowd workers, and experts in the classification of heart sound recordings. The development of a hybrid human-machine framework is motivated by the past success in utilizing human computation to solve problems in medicine and the use of human-machine frameworks in other domains. We describe the methods that decide when and how to escalate the analysis of heart sounds to different resources and incorporate their decision into a final classification. Our framework was tested with a combination of machine classifiers and crowd workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The results indicate a hybrid approach achieves greater performance than a baseline classifier alone, utilizing less expert resources while achieving similar performance, compared to a framework without the crowd. In this work, we presented and evaluated a hybrid human-machine framework for binary heart sound classification in addition to exploring how crowd workers perform in heart sound analysis tasks. Our results indicated that the crowd performs well at heart sound analysis and that our hybrid framework achieved greater performance than a baseline classifier alone, utilizing less expert resources while achieving similar performance, when compared to a framework that does not use the crowd."
UMI3D: A Unity3D Toolbox to Support CSCW Systems Properties in Generic 3D User Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274298,"UMI3D is a recent model which allows the generic description of 3D environments through a network. These generic environments can run outside of any device, on a server or on a separate computer. A unique dedicated application that we have named UMI3D client allows a VR, AR or MR device to interact with all the existing UMI3D environments. Moreover, the client-server architecture allows these environments to be collaborative. In this paper, we introduce a toolbox which allows the creation and running of UMI3D collaborative environments using Unity 3D. It contains tools to address the main concerns of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems in UMI3D environments. After introducing the contribution of this toolbox to the design of 3D CSCW systems, we present a user evaluation of an environment designed with this toolbox. Finally, we discuss the limits of the UMI3D model and the improvements that could be made to this model. In this paper we have presented a Unity3D toolbox which allows the design of generic collaborative 3D environments with the UMI3D model. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that our toolbox brings together the benefits of UMI3D and game engines for the design of collaborative 3D environments. Then we have underlined the need to extend UMI3D to support vocal communication and embodiments in order to be able to support distant cooperative work and the collaboration with immersive devices. Finally, the user study we had conducted has confirmed that our toolbox has promising properties for the quick development of collaborative 3D environments. This is why our future work will be focused on optimizing our user-oriented design process in order to improve these properties."
Complex and Ambiguous: Understanding Sticker Misinterpretations in Instant Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274299,"Stickers, though similar in appearance to emoji, have distinct characteristics because they often contain animation, diverse gestures, and multiple characters and objects. Stickers can convey richer meaning than emoji, but their complexity and placement constraint may result in miscommunication. In this paper, we aim to understand how people perceive emotion in stickers, as well as how miscommunication related to sticker occurs in actual chat contexts. Toward this goal, we conducted an online survey (n = 87) and in-depth interviews (n = 28) in South Korea. We found emotional and contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation. In particular, emotion misinterpretation mostly happened due to stickers' ambiguous (multiple) facial/bodily expressions and different perception of dynamism in gestures. In real chat settings, there were also contextual misinterpretations where senders and receivers differently interpret stickers' visual representation/reference, or/and corresponding textual messages. Based on these findings, we provide several practical design implications such as context awareness support in sticker interaction. This work investigated sticker misinterpretation in instant messaging. In Study 1, we analyzed the emotion ratings on popular stickers (n = 87) to find the patterns of emotion misinterpretation in stickers. In Study 2, we collected 140 sticker usage instances from 14 pairs of users and performed an in-depth interview to deepen our understanding about sticker misinterpretation. Our results showed that the unique characteristics of stickers such as rich expressiveness and placement constraint are the major contributors of sticker misinterpretation. Emotion misinterpretation was largely originating from complexity and ambiguity of emotional expressions in stickers. Likewise, complexity and ambiguity of stickers were related to context misinterpretation in terms of visual representation/reference and message correspondence. Based on these findings, we provided several practical design implications for mitigating emotion and context misinterpretations such as linking supporting texts and annotating stickers. Our work significantly extended prior studies on message interpretation by focusing on stickers, which has attracted enormous attention in recent years. Furthermore, our results brought new insights into the importance of contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation in sticker-enabled CMC."
SOLVENT: A Mixed Initiative System for Finding Analogies between Research Papers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274300,"Scientific discoveries are often driven by finding analogies in distant domains, but the growing number of papers makes it difficult to find relevant ideas in a single discipline, let alone distant analogies in other domains. To provide computational support for finding analogies across domains, we introduce SOLVENT, a mixed-initiative system where humans annotate aspects of research papers that denote their background (the high-level problems being addressed), purpose (the specific problems being addressed), mechanism (how they achieved their purpose), and findings (what they learned/achieved), and a computational model constructs a semantic representation from these annotations that can be used to find analogies among the research papers. We demonstrate that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. These results demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in research communities. In this paper, we introduced solvent, a mixed-initiative system for re-representing and finding analogies between research papers across different domains, in which humans produce lightweight annotations of key aspects of research paper abstracts, and a computational model constructs semantic vectors from the annotations and uses them to finds analogies between the papers. We show that solvent holds promise for efficiently finding analogies between research papers across domains, opening up novel pathways towards computationally augmenting knowledge sharing for scientific progress."
"The Internet's Hidden Rules: An Empirical Study of Reddit Norm Violations at Micro, Meso, and Macro Scales",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274301,"Norms are central to how online communities are governed. Yet, norms are also emergent, arise from interaction, and can vary significantly between communities---making them challenging to study at scale. In this paper, we study community norms on Reddit in a large-scale, empirical manner. Via 2.8M comments removed by moderators of 100 top subreddits over 10 months, we use both computational and qualitative methods to identify three types of norms: macro norms that are universal to most parts of Reddit; meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms that are specific to individual, relatively unique subreddits. Given the size of Reddit's user base---and the wide range of topics covered by different subreddits---we argue this represents the first large-scale census of the norms in broader internet culture. In other words, these findings shed light on what Reddit values, and how widely-held those values are. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of new and existing online communities. We examined community norms on Reddit in a large scale, empirical manner. Using computational and qualitative methods, we examined over 2 million comments removed over 10 months by moderators of 100 top subreddits. We identified three types of norms within Reddit: macro norms which are universal to most parts of Reddit; meso norms which are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms which are highly specific to individual subreddits. We argued that our findings represent the first large-scale study of norms across disparate online communities, given the size and diversity of Reddit’s user base. We concluded by reflecting on the apparent sharing of norms among distinct online communities, discussing implications for theory, and the design of internet communities more broadly."
Data-Driven Proactive Policy Assurance of Post Quality in Community q&a Sites,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274302,"To ensure the post quality, Q&A sites usually develop a list of quality assurance guidelines for ""dos and don'ts"", and adopt collaborative editing mechanism to fix quality violations. Quality guidelines are mostly high-level principles, and many tacit and context-sensitive aspects of the expected quality cannot be easily enforced by a set of explicit rules. Collaborative editing is a reactive mechanism after low-quality posts have been posted. Our study of collaborative editing data on Stack Overflow suggests that tacit and context-sensitive quality-assurance knowledge is manifested in the editing patterns of large numbers of collaborative edits. Inspired by this observation, we develop and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network based approach to learn editing patterns from historical post edits for predicting the need of editing a post. Our approach provides a proactive policy assurance mechanism that warns users potential quality issues in a post before it is posted. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of historical collaborative editing data on Stack Overflow to investigate the need for proactive quality assurance on Q&A sites. Our study analyzes various aspects of collaborating editing behaviors and results, including common editing types, users’ attention on different types of edits over time, scale of changes involved in post edits, and patterns of concrete editing operations. Based on our empirical observation, we identify four types of post edits (adding code format, adding text format, adding hyperlinks and adding images) that occur frequently by collaborative editing, and at the same time, involve medium-scale of changes that are feasible to predict using machine learning techniques. A CNN-based post-edit recommendation approach has been developed and the CNN model has been trained using largescale post editing data. Our evaluation through historical post editing data demonstrates the quality of the recommended post edits by our approach. We discuss the potential benefits of our post-edit recommendation approach for post owners, post editors and novice users. However, deploying our approach on Stack Overflow may have complicated impacts on social process and collaborative editing, which deserve further studies in the future. We will ask novice and trusted users on Stack Overflow to try our tool in practice and analyze the feedback to gauge its design. We will also extend our approach to other online Q&A sites, similar to or different from Stack Overflow, to understand the generalizability of our data analysis method and our deep learning approach."
Beyond Lingua Franca: System-Facilitated Language Switching Diversifies Participation in Multiparty Multilingual Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274303,"When multiple non-native speakers (NNSs) who share the same native language join a group discussion with native speakers (NSs) of the common language used in the discussion, they sometimes switch back and forth between common language and their native language to reach common ground. However, such code-switching makes others feel excluded and thus not considered appropriate during formal meetings. To offer NNSs more flexibility to code-switch in a group discussion while minimizing the cost of excluding others, we introduced a language support tool that automatically detects a user's spoken language, and then transcribe as well as translate them into another language (common language or NNS's native language). In a within-subject study involving 19 quads (two Japanese and two Chinese) in a collocated setting, participants were asked to perform a series of decision-making tasks with and without the tool. Results showed that the language support tool encouraged diverse use of language during a meeting, resulting in more participation from NNSs - they increased active initiating behaviors from NNSs. Although the perceived quality of collaboration became lower, it also elicited helping behaviors among the NNS pairs. We conducted a laboratory study to examine the idea of easing NNSs’ burden of speaking the common language by alternatively providing a language support tool which allowed them to switch back to their native language depending on conversational contexts. We found that the tool encouraged NNS to elaborate their ideas more actively and it becomes an immediate support to NNSs. Also, we found that although the translation errors may distract the participants, it elicited the helping behaviors such as oral clarification from fluent bilingual speakers which may fill the linguistic gap between NSs and NNSs. Consequently, our results suggest that by allowing language shifting behaviors of NNSs with flexibility in multiparty multilingual communication, it has the potential to cultivate more diverse idea as well as enhance group dynamics by increasing the variety of language selection and potentially the participation of NNSs. Our findings also open up an opportunity to consider future design decision of involving backchannels and behavioral-aware support in multilingual communication."
'Staged for Living': Negotiating Objects and their Values over a Porous Boundary,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274305,"We describe more than 19 months of ethnographic fieldwork with people who have embraced minimalism, a lifestyle movement focused on reducing modern life's clutter. We found that for minimalists, the home is a central but porous site for making and staging their values around objects. The home's porous boundary allows minimalists to reinforce their values around objects for others and themselves, but it also necessitates adopting strategies to assert their values when objects---entangled with others' values---move in and out the boundaries of the home. Drawing from our fieldwork, we introduce the concept of the porous boundary. ""Porosity"" impels us to consider the coupling of objects with values as we do boundary practices for the home. A porous boundary perspective, we argue, can open new design spaces in the development of novel technologies for the home. Inspired by our minimalists’ practices, we found that home is a space with a porous boundary. Focusing on the porosity of these borders provides a macroscopic perspective of how a place (e.g., the home) is intertwined with a heterogeneous and related set of actors, objects, practices, and values. Future CSCW research on domains with so-called alternative values may find the concept of porous boundary useful. It encourages researchers to articulate value practices but also how certain values are bound to multiple places and objects. Methodologically, this suggests that we ought to see what practices over the boundary of home make one’s home experiences meaningful. Given that smart home technologies now connect our home to the outside world and have potentially provided more opportunities for transferring things (physical or digital) over the boundary of our home, the concept of porous boundary may be even more relevant as it simultaneously becomes less visible [42]. We may focus our gaze on where these porous areas and surfaces are digitally situated in our daily practices. Porous boundaries, we hope, point to further promising concepts and frameworks that will help us understand and support re-configurations enacted by people on the objects and spaces that are tied to one another via the values and priorities of people’s lives."
Crowd Coach: Peer Coaching for Crowd Workers' Skill Growth,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274306,"Traditional employment usually provides mechanisms for workers to improve their skills to access better opportunities. However, crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) generally do not support skill development (i.e., becoming faster and better at work). While researchers have started to tackle this problem, most solutions are dependent on experts or requesters willing to help. However, requesters generally lack the necessary knowledge, and experts are rare and expensive. To further facilitate crowd workers' skill growth, we present Crowd Coach, a system that enables workers to receive peer coaching while on the job. We conduct a field experiment and real world deployment to study Crowd Coach in the wild. Hundreds of workers used Crowd Coach in a variety of tasks, including writing, doing surveys, and labeling images. We find that Crowd Coach enhances workers' speed without sacrificing their work quality, especially in audio transcription tasks. We posit that peer coaching systems hold potential for better supporting crowd workers' skill development while on the job. We finish with design implications from our research. This paper introduced Crowd Coach, a Chrome extension to promote workers’ personal skill building by supporting peer coaching while on the job. Crowd Coach uses peer micro-advice and a twofold reputation mechanism to help workers personally improve their skills. Crowd Coach differentiates itself from prior work by helping crowd workers to improve their skills by depending on the crowd workers themselves rather than requesters or experts. Moreover, Crowd Coach innovates on related work by embedding the help mechanisms within tasks so that work growth can be achieved while on the job, and by supporting workers to provide and receive the coaching through micro-coaching snippets rather than lengthy and comprehensive assistance. In this way, our system grounds itself in the practical concerns and constraints that both crowd workers and requesters face, such as limited time and resources available to devote to improving skills or task workflow designs. The present study sets the stage for future systems that focus on creating rewarding labor experiences where crowd workers can personally grow while on the job."
Will Too Many Editors Spoil The Tag?: Conflicts and Alignment in Q&A Categorization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274307,"Q&A websites compile useful knowledge through user-generated questions and responses. Many Q&As use collaborative tagging systems to improve search and discovery while distributing the work of categorizing and organization throughout the community. Although early work on collaborative tagging questioned whether consistent categorization schemes could emerge from large groups with little to no coordination, empirical studies have found surprising coherence among users' tags. We build on this research by testing whether coherence emerges in tag usage on Q&As, a more challenging context, focusing in particular on mismatches in the specificity of tags (basic level disagreement). We found that some users shifted toward more specific tag usage over time slightly increasing conflict, but that moderators were instrumental in helping to resolve some of this conflict. This study highlights the importance of learning and moderation in the development of coherence in collaborative tagging systems. Q&A websites compile useful knowledge through user-generated questions and answers. Collaborative tagging has been adopted by some Q&As to make it easier to label, organize, and find content. We investigated whether users naturally tended toward more consistent tag usage over time as would be expected if users were assimilating conceptual structures [10]. We found low level inconsistency in tag usage that persisted and got slightly worse over time as some users shifted toward more specific tags. We found that moderation helped to reduce inconsistencies. We argue that there may be widespread benefit to allowing moderators to edit tags."
Living in the Present: Understanding Long-Term Content Referencing in Enterprise Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274308,"Successful online communities accumulate large amounts of long-term content. However there has been little quantitative, theoretically-motivated exploration of how communities organize such content, nor which community members take responsibility for active organization. We examine one aspect of long-term content organization through link behavior, also exploring role differences between enterprise community leaders and members in the context of life-cycle community models. We first classify how content is linked within posts, identifying usage patterns that organize information within and outside communities. We next present an exploratory quantitative analysis of 2,010 communities including 428,476 posts and 1,246,570 links. We show paradoxically that although mature communities accumulate substantial content, organizing that content using links decreases over time. Further analyses suggest that this arises from a recency bias, with communities being focused on current content. Our results also challenge descriptive lifecycle community models, which propose that regular community members adopt greater responsibility over time. We explore explanations for our findings and implications including new tools that encourage responsibility for active organization, as well as methods for members to revisit critical content. This paper presents new results about how community behaviors change over time. Although this study is exploratory in assessing content referencing, our findings are nevertheless counterintuitive in light of current theory. As expected, content increased over time and Members took responsibility for creating such content. However contradicting current life-cycle model predictions, referencing did not increase as content accrued and instead decreased as communities aged. Furthermore, Members did not assume responsibility for content referencing. We explored one possible explanation for this lack of content referencing, finding that communities tend to focus on very recent content, making it less important for them to focus on managing older material. We describe new tools and leader practices that might better utilize older content."
Engaging with Health Data: The Interplay Between Self-Tracking Activities and Emotions in Fertility Struggles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274309,"Self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. Lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. We explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. We qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. We found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. Each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. We discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. We also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. Finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area. In this study, we identified that women perform fertility self-tracking with different types of engagement. We identified five different types: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. Each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component. We suggest that this interplay characterizes the different types of engagement with data women may have when self-tracking for fertility. These findings are aligned with previous literature describing the possible negative consequences of tracking, such as feelings of failure, making a health condition more visible, frustration, and obsession. They also provide a deeper understanding of how different people engage differently with health data: ones with more positive attitudes while others have more problematic relationships with their data. Such intense and emotionally consuming experiences with self-tracking need to be considered in the design of self-tracking tools and interventions. As other health conditions may have similarly complex, unique, and uncertain manifestations (e.g., eating disorders [16]), it is possible that a similar process may occur in different health contexts. We approached how the broader issues of the culture of quantification impact on the relationship between the goal, the tracking activities, and the emotional experience of tracking in this context. Finally, we discussed possible implications derived from these findings that could help alleviate the problematic aspects we described."
Spacetime Characterization of Real-Time Collaborative Editing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274310,"Real-Time Collaborative Editing (RTCE) is a popular way of instrumenting cooperative work on documents, in particular on the Web. Little is known in the literature yet about RTCE usage patterns in the real world. In this paper we study how a popular RTCE editor (Etherpad) is used in the wild, digging into the edit histories of a large collection of documents (about 14 000 pads), retrieved from one of the most popular public instances of the platform, hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. The pad analysis is supported by a novel conceptual model that allows to label edit operations as ""collaborative"" or not depending on their distance-in edit position (space), edit time, or spacetime (both)-from edits made by other authors. The model is applied to classify all edits from the pad corpus. Classification results are further used to characterize the collaboration behavior of pad authors. Findings show that: 1) about half of the pads have a single author and hence witnessed no collaboration; 2) collaboration on common document parts happens often, but it happens asynchronously with authors taking turns in editing; and 3) simultaneous editing of common document parts happens very rarely. These findings help in revisiting early RTCE design decisions (e.g., the granularity of conflict management in RTCE protocols) and give insights on how to address novel needs (e.g., end-to-end encryption and offline editing). We have studied documents edited on one of the largest public instances (14 000 pads) of the Etherpad real-time collaborative editor (RTCE) to characterize real-time collaboration on the Web. The characterization is based on a novel model that captures collaboration along three dimensions: time (whether collaboration happens simultaneously or almost so), space (whether collaboration happens in nearby parts of the document), and spacetime (both). Our findings show real-time collaboration happens, but not very often. A very limited number of pads witness simultaneous collaboration on nearby document areas; time collaboration (on unrelated document parts) is more frequent; space collaboration on the same document portions (but during editing sessions that are far apart in time) is the most common. These results are influenced by the public setting of the studied Etherpad instance. It is possible that private deployments would show larger amounts of collaboration within more coordinated teams working on shared documents. On the other hand the study of a freely accessible service shed some light onto real-time collaboration in the wild."
Evaluating Crowdworkers as a Proxy for Online Learners in Video-Based Learning Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274311,"Crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective method of scaling-up tasks previously reserved for a small set of experts. Accordingly, researchers in the large-scale online learning space have begun to employ crowdworkers to conduct research about large-scale, open online learning. We here report results from a crowdsourcing study (N=135) to evaluate the extent to which crowdworkers and MOOC learners behave comparably on lecture viewing and quiz tasks---the most utilized learning activities in MOOCs. This serves to (i) validate the assumption of previous research that crowdworkers are indeed reliable proxies of online learners and (ii) address the potential of employing crowdworkers as a means of online learning environment testing. Overall, we observe mixed results---in certain contexts (quiz performance and video watching behavior) crowdworkers appear to behave comparably to MOOC learners, and in other situations (interactions with in-video quizzes), their behaviors appear to be disparate. We conclude that future research should be cautious if employing crowdworkers to carry out learning tasks, as the two populations do not behave comparably on all learning-related activities. In conclusion, we here report on a study which employs crowd workers to evaluate the extent to which they can serve as reliable proxies for MOOC learners for the purposes of both learning analytics research and testing. Specifically, we find that (i) the crowd workers behave comparably to MOOC learners in their engagement with standard lecture videos, (ii) the two populations do not engage similarly with in-video quiz question materials, and (iii) the two populations perform comparably on assessment/quiz activities. We also contribute VidQuiz, the open-source in-video quizzing software created to carry out the experiment."
Coloring in the Links: Capturing Social Ties as They are Perceived,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274312,"The richness that characterizes relationships is often absent when they are modeled using computational methods in network science. Typically, relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. The lack of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to categorize relationships. Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. We also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. Overall, by proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking applications."
'Too Gay for Facebook': Presenting LGBTQ+ Identity Throughout the Personal Social Media Ecosystem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274313,"Most US social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. For LGBTQ+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. These choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. Moreover, many LGBTQ+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their LGBTQ+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. This combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ and other potentially stigmatized users. We adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 LGBTQ+ social media users. We find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ""personal social media ecosystems"" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their LGBTQ+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time. In this paper, we have applied an ecological lens to LGBTQ+ self-presentation, allowing us to see that it is the range of options provided by an individual’s personal social media ecosystem that ensures both the necessary protections from stigmatization as well as the access to social support needed by LGBTQ+ individuals. Our contributions provide guidance for researchers and designers alike in further efforts to understand and support LGBTQ+ individuals in achieving their self-presentation goals, and lay the groundwork for future in-depth work on LGBTQ+ populations in an increasingly diversifying social media space."
Score-Group Framing Negatively Impacts Peer Evaluations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274314,"How does group membership framing affect the feedback students provide learners? This paper presents two between-subjects experiments investigating the effect of Ingroup/Outgroup membership on effort spent in peer evaluations, and whether the group membership criterion type affects quality and stringency of evaluation. Two peer-review assignments were implemented in two separate classes. In the first study, students were nominally grouped by location they sat in class and non-nominally grouped by current class score; each was asked to review an Ingroup and Outgroup peer assignment. A second study randomly assigned students to one of four group types (random, score, motivation, and location); student reviewed two Ingroup assignments. In both studies, score-grouped students graded their peers more stringently than students grouped by location. These studies illustrate for system designers the impacts of group framing - and the disclosure of that-in peer review tasks. This project made headway in understanding the effect of disclosing features on effort spent helping peers. Although we hypothesized, based on social-psychological research, that an Ingroup/Outgroup effect may be easily elicited with any feature of similarity, this turned out not to be the case. Features matter, and our results highlight the complicated effects of being grouped by Score. The fact that we found similar effects in two different classes suggests that they might be generalizable to peer-review in a classroom/course setting. In our study, although students took part in a physical class, students reviewed their peers anonymously online. It remains to be tested how this would compare to peer reviews in a fully online classroom, or even other online forums such as stack exchange or Wikipedia, where formative feedback is encouraged. In a completely online setting, where location in space is not shared, emphasis on location would likely have an effect. Ultimately, if disclosing features can reduce social distance between peers in reciprocal social computing tasks like peer review, then easy interventions may be put in place to increase learner-centered collaboration in online environments, where the goal is large-scale, highquality assessment."
Understanding Gender Equity in Author Order Assignment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274315,"Women remain underrepresented in many fields in computer science, particularly at higher levels. In academia, success and promotion are influenced by a researcher's publication record. In many fields, including computer science, multi-author papers are the norm. Evidence from other fields shows that author order norms can influence the assignment of credit. We conduct interviews of students and faculty in human-computer interaction (HCI) and machine learning (ML) to determine factors related to assignment of author order in collaborative publication. The outcomes of these interviews then informed metrics of interest for a bibliometric analysis of gender and collaboration in research papers published from 1996 to 2016 in three top HCI and ML conferences. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for assignment of credit in multi-author papers and interpretation of author order, particularly in regard to how this area affects women. This project has proven invaluable for all authors of this paper, who have changed their practices on authorship decisions. One now tracks how often she is last author compared to co-authors to ensure she speaks up if necessary. Another hasraised the question of how to trade last position when students are co-advised. All faculty authors train their students to be proactive about authorship discussions, including providing scripts for requesting credit. While we have found these strategies to be transformational, further research on mitigating bias in authorship is important future work."
Shifting Expectations: Understanding Youth Employees' Handoffs in a 3D Print Shop,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274316,"As digital fabrication technology has become mainstream, the increased demand for 3D printed objects has created a new market for professional outsourcing. Given that most of this work does not require advanced training, and is an appropriate entry-level manufacturing job, there is an exciting opportunity to employ youth already skilled in ""making"" and interested in technology to do this work as an after-school job. The combination of this new technology and workforce calls for new workflows that streamline client-driven digital manufacturing. However, the limitations of current digital fabrication technology and youth schedules require that this work be spread between multiple shifts, necessitating employees to coordinate and handoff their work. We investigated the collaborative practices between youth employees while working on client jobs in a 3D print shop during one year of field work. In this paper, we describe instances where youth employees successfully, and unsuccessfully, handed off work between shifts and identify techniques utilized by youth to support successful handoffs, including: counting physical artifacts, using asynchronous chat programs, and documenting work. We then discuss the impact of the print shop manager's presence, physical characteristics of 3D prints, and youth perspectives of work on the selection of and effectiveness of these techniques. Finally, we offer lessons learned from successful handoffs in the print shop and recommendations for supporting youth in collaborative work environments."
The Influence of Friends and Experts on Privacy Decision Making in IoT Scenarios,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274317,"As increasingly many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices collect personal data, users face more privacy decisions. Personal privacy assistants can provide social cues and help users make informed decisions by presenting information about how others have decided in similar cases. To better understand which social cues are relevant and whose recommendations users are more likely to follow, we presented 1000 online participants with nine IoT data-collection scenarios. Some participants were told the percentage of experts or friends who allowed data collection in each scenario, while other participants were provided no social cue. At the conclusion of each scenario, participants were asked whether they would allow the described data collection. Our results help explain under what circumstances users are more or less likely to be swayed by the reported behavior of others in similar scenarios. For example, our results indicate that when friends denied data collection, our participants were more influenced than when friends allowed data collection. On the other hand, participants were more influenced by experts when they allowed data collection. We also observed that influence could get stronger or wear off when participants were exposed to a sequence of scenarios. For example, when experts and friends repeatedly allowed data collection in scenarios with clear risk or denied it in scenarios with clear benefits, participants were less likely to be influenced by them in subsequent scenarios. As IoT devices become more widespread and people confront choices about personal data collection, the number of decisions to be made may be overwhelming. In this paper, we explored the impact of social cues in helping people make faster, more informed decisions regarding their privacy. To understand how people will be influenced by social cues from privacy experts and friends, we conducted an online user study with 1000 Mechanical Turk participants, randomly assigned to five conditions. We presented each participant with nine hypothetical data collection scenarios. In four conditions, we showed participants what percentage of experts or friends allowed the data collection. In the fifth condition, we described the data collections without any additional information. Our statistical results confirmed the impact of social cues on people making privacy decisions. We also found that the extent of this influence is dependent on various factors such as the level of privacy protectiveness of influencers’ decisions and the strength of the social cues. We believe our findings can inform the design of more effective privacy assistants."
Do Students' Learning Behaviors Differ when they Collaborate in Open-Ended Learning Environments?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274318,"Researchers have long recognized the importance of using technology to support students' collaboration in learning and problem solving tasks. Recently, there has been a lot of research in capturing and characterizing student discourse and how they regulate each other when they perform learning tasks in pairs or in small groups. In this paper, our goal is to dive a little deeper into how students collaborate, and the learning behaviors they exhibit when working in pairs on a learning by modeling task, while also teaching a virtual agent in the Betty's Brain system. We report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. The results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. A differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. The differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually. This study examined how working in pairs influenced students’ learning behaviors and performance when they worked on model building tasks in the Betty’s Brain environment, where students learn by teaching (i.e., building a model for) their virtual agent. This study sought to determine the effect of collaboration on students’ learning behaviors and their effect on their performance, both in terms of their pre-post learning gains and their map scores. The current study found that collaboration has a significant effect on students’ learning gains, and the collaborating students outperformed the students who worked individually in terms of their learning gains on the science content, as well as their ability to build correct maps. This result confirms the beneficial effects of collaboration on learning that has been reported in the literature [25,27,37]. With respect to the learning behaviors, the DSM analyses indicate that the collaborating students adopt a more systematic approach to learning and model building (demonstrated by their ability to work together in co-constructing knowledge). This can be partially attributed to the fact that collaboration had a positive effect on their ability to analyze their quiz results and debug Do Students’ Learning Behaviors Differ When They Collaborate? 49:17 Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, Vol. 2, No. CSCW, Article 49, Publication date: November 2018. their map (self-assessment behavior as seen in Patterns 1 and 2 of DSM analyses). When combined with Pattern 7 generated by the DSM analyses, becomes clear that the collaborating students are better able to interpret quiz results, and turn them into effective map correcting actions or reading actions that lead to correct addition of links to their maps. The effectiveness of map edits in Table 3 further supports this result. The example conversations reported in this paper further confirm the stronger debugging abilities of the collaborating students. On the other hand, students working individually ended up spending a lot of time in reading the resources. However, they were unable to translate their reading to model building and learning of the science content. Johnson and Johnson [18] argue that synthesis of multiple perceptions might result in better solutions and decisions to complex problems. These results match similar behavioral patterns found in a past study on collaborative learning by Emara, et al. [11] and Kapur [21]. Similar differences were also found between high and low performing students working individually [22,24]."
Watch Me Code: Programming Mentorship Communities on Twitch.tv,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274319,"Live streaming-an emerging practice of broadcasting video of oneself in real time to an online audience-is often used by people to portray themselves engaged in a craft such as programming. Viewers of these 'creative streams' gather to watch the streamer at work and to interact with the streamer and other audience members. However, little is known about how creative streamers engage with their audience, how their viewership communities form and operate, and how creative streams may support learning. In this study, we used a participant-observer method to study game development streams on the live streaming site Twitch.tv. We found that live streams support the growth of learning-focused communities that mentor both the streamer and each other during and after streams. We show the influence of streamers in creating a space for learning and motivating learners. Finally, we discuss implications for online education and communities of practice. In this paper, we have presented an overview of the mentoring communities that are found on the live streaming platform Twitch.tv. In this study, we used a participant-observer method to study creative streams on the live streaming site Twitch.tv. These communities are formed through the actions of the streamer, who draws in viewers through their ability to provide insightful comments while performing. Mentorship is not provided solely by the streamer, as a stream’s viewers takes it upon themselves to mentor both the streamer and other viewers. This culture of mentorship and assistance is then extended beyond the stream to asynchronous chat servers such as Discord that support further beyond the temporal and subject scope of the stream. We have discussed implications for online learning communities and CSCL, and suggested avenues for further research and design in this emerging area of research."
Beyond the Coded Gaze: Analyzing Expression of Mental Health and Illness on Instagram,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274320,"In CSCW and HCI, work examining expression of mental health and illness on social media frequently aims to classify content, quantify visual trends, and predict user states. This approach to analysis is a form of the coded gaze, a type of algorithmic 'way of seeing' coined with respect to artificial intelligence techniques. The coded gaze classifies content through researcher- and machine-labeled categories, relying on a series of theoretical assumptions that influence how values pertaining to mental health and illness become inscribed in data. In this paper, we build upon this research to support alternative methods of data interpretation. We join manual collection of Instagram posts with semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography over six months to understand how Instagram users express their experiences with mental health and illness. We argue that individuals negotiate claims to mental health and illness through visibility and signaling, the boundaries between mental health and illness are porous and blurred, and reposting and remix are a form of participation. We discuss practical and ethical implications for studying the expression of mental health and illness online. Expression of mental health and illness is an active negotiation of content production and circulation. Individuals on Instagram make their experiences visible through sharing original, reposted, and remixed content without necessarily making claim to a particular relationship with mental health or illness. The ways that individuals choose to make their experiences salient is influenced by platform practices and social norms, as well as broader cultural representations of mental health and illness. HCI and CSCW scholars frequently employ the coded gaze to analyze online content related to mental health and illness. Though beneficial for a variety of reasons, such as the ability to recognize depression and predict suicidal ideation, application of the coded gaze assumes generalizable findings that deemphasize individual experience; a static, objective record of content that does not explore alternative interpretations; and an implicit goal of classification. We argue that the coded gaze restricts opportunities for understanding the intricacies of how individuals claim, signal, and make visible experiences with mental health and illness. By diversifying methodological approaches in this space, we can open up new avenues for research and support complimentary ways of understanding how individuals express mental health and illness online."
'Welcome' Changes?: Descriptive and Injunctive Norms in a Wikipedia Sub-Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274321,"Open online communities rely on social norms for behavior regulation, group cohesion, and sustainability. Research on the role of social norms online has mainly focused on one source of influence at a time, making it difficult to separate different normative influences and understand their interactions. In this study, we use the Focus Theory to examine interactions between several sources of normative influence in a Wikipedia sub-community: local descriptive norms, local injunctive norms, and norms imported from similar sub-communities. We find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior. We contextualize these findings through member interviews, and discuss their implications for both future research on normative influence in online groups and the design of systems that support open collaboration. In this paper, we drew on the Focus Theory to examine interactions between different sources of normative influence on answering behavior of 7060 contributors to a Wikipedia Q&A forum for new editors, the Teahouse. Specifically, we examined local descriptive and injunctive norms, their congruent effects, and conflict between different sources of normative influence due to membership overlap in a similar Q&A community, the Help Desk. Our findings across 4 years of data suggest that exposure to both explicitly defined injunctive norms and indirect exposure to injunctive norms through corrective practices have more persistent association with pro-normative behavior than exposure to behavioral examples (descriptive norms) alone; that exposure to descriptive norms is only associated with pro-normative behavior when norm-associated phenomena are easily identifiable as such; and that the highest level of normative compliance is associated with exposure to both explicitly defined injunctive norms and plentiful recent examples of pro-normative behavior. Additionally, we find that experience in a related sub-community with conflicting norms can be associated with either less or more pro-normative behavior, depending on the type of norm conflict experienced. We contextualized our findings with interviews with Teahouse participants, and presented implications both for theory building on normative influence in online collaborative communities, as well as practical implications for the design and management of these communities."
Women (Still) Ask For Less: Gender Differences in Hourly Rate in an Online Labor Marketplace,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274322,"In many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. However, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). In this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the United States (48.8% women) on Upwork, a popular gig work platform. The median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. However, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. To better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities. As technology increasingly supports work across the globe, online labor marketplaces have been of increasing interest to CSCW and social computing researchers (e.g., [70, 73]). Our results lead our understanding of the relationship between gender, bill rate-setting, and earned revenue in these marketplaces. In this study, we found that women ask for only 74% of what men ask for in median hourly bill rate on Upwork, one of the largest online labor marketplaces in the world. However, we also found that by working more hours at these lower rates, women earn as much or more than men overall. The current work contributes to a developing body of research by gender studies scholars in CSCW and social computing who study barriers to participation in other social technologies, such as peer production sites, online communities, social media, and blogs [31, 42, 59]. As scholars, we must better understand how women decide on hourly rates and hours worked if online labor marketplaces are to more equally engage women in the paid labor force."
"Gender, Feedback, and Learners' Decisions to Share Their Creative Computing Projects",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274323,"Although informal online learning communities are made possible by users' decisions to share their creations, participation by females and other marginalized groups remains stubbornly low in technical communities. Using descriptive statistics and a unique dataset of shared and unshared projects from over 1.1 million users of Scratch-a collaborative programming community for young people-we show that while girls share less initially, this trend flips among experienced users. Using Bayesian regression analyses, we show that this relationship can largely be attributed to differences in the way boys and girls participate. We also find that while prior positive feedback is correlated with increased sharing among inexperienced users, this effect also reverses with experience or with the addition of controls. Our findings provide a description of the dynamics behind online learners' decisions to share, open new research questions, and point to several lessons for system designers. We present our study with the hope that future work will look more deeply into the factors that influence sharing behaviors. We also hope that future studies will extend our work’s encouraging suggestion that female participation becomes more robust once an initial barrier to engagement is overcome as well as examining our surprising result that motivational feedback such as “love its” is associated with less future sharing of creative artifacts. Although our study is restricted to one community, we hope that future researchers will apply and extend our questions and methods in the context of other online communities, leading to a more general understanding of gender disparity in technology and in learner engagement in informal online communities more broadly"
To Label or Not to Label: The Effect of Stance and Credibility Labels on Readers' Selection and Perception of News Articles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274324,"Social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. For example, Blue Feed, Red Feed, a news feed created by the Wall Street Journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. To combat the spread of fake news, Facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. To systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. Results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. We found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. Although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. Our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption. Overall, our results suggest that stance and credibility labels can affect people’s news article selection and perception in ways that deviate from their original intended effects. As a result, such effects are often neglected in online news platform designs. Thus, social media designers should be cautious about using labels. Our results show that, consistent with previous studies, assigning credibility labels to articles (such as ""Disputed"") is not effective for combating fake news. Interestingly, stance labels, which are often designed to help people find information, may have undesirable effects on facilitating the spread of fake news. Specifically, we found that stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they seem to lower people’s perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. Without systematic evaluation, those unintended, yet undesirable, effects of stance labels could not have been detected. In fact, our results suggest that stance labels may reinforce users’ existing beliefs and indirectly exacerbate polarization of social opinions."
Social Photo-Elicitation: The Use of Communal Production of Meaning to Hear a Vulnerable Population,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274325,"We report on an initial ethnographic exploration of the situation of sex-trafficking survivors in Nepal. In the course of studying trafficking survivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental organization in Nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the survivors by making the technique more communal. Bringing sociality to the forefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as individuals, allowing them to speak. We make three contributions to research. First, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit values in sensitive settings. Second, we present the complex circumstances of the survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a ""new normal"". Third, our work adds to HCI and CSCW literature on understanding specific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can support reintegration of survivors in society. The values that the survivors hold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but important social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid reintegration. We created a social photo-elicitation activity as part of trying to understand the situation of sextrafficking survivors in Nepal. The activity positioned the intentions of the authors – especially those from Nepal – in a “proto-reflective” situation; that is, taking action with an intervention will perturb the system, but inaction is problematic. We learned about their complex relationships with crafting and their envisioned reintegration with the society at large. A first read of the findings from this work might suggest that there is no design space for responsible technological intervention with this community in this setting. In fact, a closer read of the findings along with a broader interpretation of what CSCW research is about supports the further investigation of the particulars of the sister-survivors’ longer-term needs and their relationship to social technologies. That is, they are embedded in a social network of great complexity that is in turn embedded in a highly structured, but fraught culture; the challenge now is to configure technological social infrastructure in that context. Our findings obey the CSCW and HCI mandates of encountering people in the complexities of their lived lives. The complexities of these lived lives deepen our understanding of the limited but important social capital that the survivors hold. Beyond the particulars of this situation, it is crucial that CSCW continue to grow in its understanding of ethical responsibilities and its contemplation of what elements of a situation or a design allow ethical intervention. The two key questions in design are, “How do you know what is the right thing to do?” and “How do you know when you have done it?”"
Eight Observations and 24 Research Questions About Open Source Projects: Illuminating New Realities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274326,"The rapid acceleration of corporate engagement with open source projects is drawing out new ways for CSCW researchers to consider the dynamics of these projects. Research must now consider the complex ecosystems within which open source projects are situated, including issues of for-profit motivations, brokering foundations, and corporate collaboration. Localized project considerations cannot reveal broader workings of an open source ecosystem, yet much empirical work is constrained to a local context. In response, we present eight observations from our eight-year engaged field study about the changing nature of open source projects. We ground these observations through 24 research questions that serve as primers to spark research ideas in this new reality of open source projects. This paper contributes to CSCW in social and crowd computing by delivering a rich and fresh look at corporately-engaged open source projects with a call for renewed focus and research into newly emergent areas of interest. Practitioners often acknowledge aspects of the new realities in open source projects but few examine their full scope of consequence. Ideals from the free software movement persist and continue to guide individual engagement in open source projects, which is noble but can be out of step with the emerging open source project reality. Project maintainers must understand the significance of the supply chains their projects become part of to avoid exposing not only immediate users but national infrastructure projects to failures that can stem from interconnectedness. Organizations seeking to balance the use of open source software in their internal innovation streams must adjust internal practices to account for open source project health risks and how its engagement impacts a larger software ecosystem. Open source projects and their vast ecosystems, as a whole, are facing a collective action challenge born of the tensions between its past and the emerging future. The new realities of open source projects are shifting who benefits from the wealth generated in these projects. We observed many new realities (e.g., changes of membership from volunteers to paid employees to a lack of effective market mechanisms). These new realities are interrelated and cannot be solved by a single open source project or organization, but provide new forms of engagement in the design and distribution of software. New mechanisms of practice and research can be developed to incentivize the development of healthy projects that produce secure software, incentivize the engagement of volunteers who are not affiliated with an organization, and continue to leverage the traditional and successful open source development model. This paper is intended to serve as a starting point for these new conversations."
Fake Cures: User-centric Modeling of Health Misinformation in Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274327,"Social media's unfettered access has made it an important venue for health discussion and a resource for patients and their loved ones. However, the quality of information available, as well as the motivations of its posters, has been questioned. This work examines the individuals on social media that are posting questionable health-related information, and in particular promoting cancer treatments which have been shown to be ineffective (making it a kind of misinformation, willful or not). Using a multi-stage user selection process, we study 4,212 Twitter users who have posted about one of 139 such ""treatments"", and compare them to a baseline of users generally interested in cancer. Considering features capturing user attributes, writing style, and sentiment, we build a classifier which is able to identify users prone to propagate such misinformation at an accuracy of over 90%, providing a potential tool for public health officials to identify such individuals for preventive intervention. In this paper we present a case study of health misinformation on social media by examining Twitter users involved in propagating alternative medicines claiming to treat or cure cancer. Through a multi-stage process including machine learning, crowdsourcing, and heuristics, we select users who are likely to be real people, and who post on one of 139 such topics. We find that these users are likely to use more sophisticated language, and circulate in health domain prior to posting a rumor, but are not likely to be personally involved in the illness. Our findings suggest that cancer treatment misinformation may be spread not by patients, but by other actors. More research needs to be done to ascertain motivations, tactics, and impact of such accounts. Finally, the dataset collected for this study presents a highly-curated resource for the research community’s future studies on the topic of health misinformation."
GuessTheKarma: A Game to Assess Social Rating Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274328,"Popularity systems, like Twitter retweets, Reddit upvotes, and Pinterest pins have the potential to guide people toward posts that others liked. That, however, creates a feedback loop that reduces their informativeness: items marked as more popular get more attention, so that additional upvotes and retweets may simply reflect the increased attention and not independent information about the fraction of people that like the items. How much information remains? For example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item A to item B if item A had hundreds of upvotes on Reddit and item B had only a few? We investigate using an Internet game called GuessTheKarma that collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. Unlike the rating systems that dominate social media services, GuessTheKarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence ratings. Overall, Reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by GuessTheKarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the time. However, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. Similarly, Imgur view counts for the images were poor predictors except when there were orders of magnitude differences between the pairs. We conclude that popularity systems marked by feedback loops may convey a strong signal about population preferences, but only when comparing items that received vastly different popularity scores. In this work we presented GuessTheKarma, a survey tool that can be used to explore the performance of social rating systems, and an analysis of two social media rating systems, Reddit votes and Imgur views. Through its tournament style setup, the GuessTheKarma game removed many of the social influence effects and algorithmic, design, and ranking biases, that have been previously reported in social rating systems research. Therefore, discrepancies between GuessTheKarma-judgments and Reddit scores (or Imgur view counts) can be primarily explained by the presence of socio-technical influence dynamics in the the Reddit scores and Imgur view counts. The results suggest that Reddit vote-scores and Imgur view-counts are relatively poor predictors of user preference except when one image has a much higher score than the other. For example, images with scores in the top 5% of scores within their subreddit paired with an image whose score falls within the bottom half of all scores were preferred by GuessTheKarma players almost 90% of the time. Unsurprisingly, we found that individual players were less accurate predictors, performing slightly better than random. However, we also did not find significant differences between players of varying expertise or familiarity with the platforms or communities we compared. Finally, we found no difference in the accuracy of active members of a subreddit, even small subreddits, compared to those respondents that did not use Reddit."
Personalized Motivation-supportive Messages for Increasing Participation in Crowd-civic Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274329,"In crowd-civic systems, citizens form groups and work towards shared goals, such as discovering social issues or reforming official policies. Unfortunately, many real-world systems have been unsuccessful in continually motivating large numbers of citizens to participate voluntarily, despite various approaches such as gamification and persuasion techniques. In this paper, we examine the influence of personalized messages designed to support motivation as asserted by the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). We designed a crowd-civic platform for collecting community issues with personalized motivation-supportive messages and conducted two studies: a pair-comparison experiment with 150 participants on Amazon's Mechanical Turk and a live deployment study with 120 university members. Results of the pair-comparison study indicate applicability of SDT's perspective in crowd-civic systems. While applying it in the live system surfaced several challenges, including recruiting participants without interfering with general motivations, the collected data exhibited similar promising trends. In this paper, we investigated the effects of motivation-supportive messages in crowd-civic systems. Informed by the Self-Determination theory, we created several messages for a number of tasks related to idea generation for social communities. In two studies, we gathered evidence for the applicability of this theory as well as a possibility of personalization. This work has implications for the design of systems that benefit from engagement from diverse groups. Especially in crowdcivic systems, this may increase not only overall participation, but also representativeness and inclusiveness."
"Navigating the Healthcare Service ""Black Box"": Individual Competence and Fragmented System",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274330,"CSCW research has investigated how people at workplace and organizational settings gain knowledge required for work, but less is known regarding how ""organizational outsiders"" obtain knowledge about organizations and organizational landscapes that provide a service. Gaining knowledge about service landscapes is particularly difficult because they are often complex, non-transparent, and fragmented. We address this gap through an interview study of 19 U.S. parents regarding how they navigated health services for their young children, and how they gained competence in navigation practices. We describe a similar process all participants went through including four inherently iterative stages: seeking and integrating knowledge, decision-making, encountering breakdowns, and repairing and reflecting. We further elucidate what constitutes navigational competence, or the creation of resources about how to navigate, for our participants. We discuss how our study could advance understanding of navigation practices, and the importance for HCI design to support these complex yet essential navigation practices and the accumulation of navigational competence. In this paper, we reported on 19 parents’ navigation practices and accumulation of navigational competence in coping with the healthcare system in the United States. We described a common process that participants undertook as they frequently encountered navigational breakdowns that were inherently interorganizational. By discussing navigational competence in depth, we hope to contribute to not only research on patient work/expertise/strategy/literacy in the domain of healthcare, but also deepen the understandings of the work that organizational outsiders have to perform in order to cope with complex, opaque, and fragmented service landscapes. There are urgent needs for more research on this topic in a variety of domains, as well as design activities that could support individuals’ navigation."
Productivity in an Era of Multi-Teaming: The Role of Information Dashboards and Shared Cognition in Team Performance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274331,"When and why do information dashboards enhance team productivity? We explore this question in the context of project teams whose members have to work across multiple teams at the same time. We expected multi-teaming, especially that involving a high variety in team members, would have a negative effect on team performance by impairing a team's transactive memory system (TMS), a critical form of shared cognition allowing members to keep track of who knows what. Further, we expected the use of an information dashboard with member skills could combat the harmful effects of high-variety multi-teaming. To test our hypotheses experimentally, we developed an online game (Knowledge Worker's Dilemma) that simulates the coordination decisions that professionals face in app development teams. Results show multi-teaming hurt team performance by reducing TMS; use of an information dashboard benefited high-variety teams and, surprisingly, hurt the performance of low-variety teams. Potential explanations and implications are discussed. Although multi-teaming is a wide spread reality for today’s project teams, we have only begun to understand its impact on team performance, and the role that information systems can play in mitigating those effects. In an effort to empirically study this phenomenon, we developed an online game that simulated the decisions team members face in a multi-teaming context. The results of our empirical study indicated it would be beneficial to work with a consistent set of core team members (i.e., maintain low multi-teaming variety) and that higher levels of multi-teaming hurt teams’ ability to coordinate and perform. We also found evidence that a team’s transactive memory system (TMS), a critical form of shared cognition mediates the negative effects of increasing multi-teaming variety on performance. Finally, our study suggests that using information dashboards to offset these effects is helpful for high-variety multiteaming contexts. For low-variety teams, it may be better to focus on team fundamentals like equality of team member contribution to achieve good performance."
Social Media as Social Transition Machinery,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274332,"Social media, and people's online self-presentations and social networks, add complexity to people's experiences managing changing identities during life transitions. I use gender transition as a case study to understand how people experience liminality on social media. I qualitatively analyzed data from transition blogs on Tumblr (n=240), a social media blogging site on which people document their gender transitions, and in-depth interviews with transgender bloggers (n=20). I apply ethnographer van Gennep's liminality framework to a social media context and contribute a new understanding of liminality by arguing that reconstructing one's online identity during life transitions is a rite of passage. During life transitions, people present multiple identities simultaneously on different social media sites that together comprise what I call social transition machinery. Social transition machinery describes the ways that, for people facing life transitions, multiple social media sites and networks o""en remain separate, yet work together to facilitate life transitions. Existing on multiple social media sites simultaneously is central to many people’s online social lives today [98]. However, presenting different versions of self to different networks is especially important for people during life transitions, as I have shown in this study. Transition work cannot be done all in one online place. My concept of social transition machinery describes the ways that different social media sites and networks remain separate, yet work together, to enable people to carry out different types of transition work and draw from different types of support networks. Using this concept, I contribute a new understanding of how people experience liminality on social media, and argue that reconstructing one’s online identity on social media is a rite of passage. My description of liminality is a substantial departure from previous literature, which characterized transitional periods in people’s lives as neutral or identity-less – which, in my view, further marginalizes transitional populations. Instead, I argue that existing multiply on different social media sites and remaining connected to several different networks is far from a neutral experience. To best facilitate online transition work, social media sites should be designed to foster social connectivity while acknowledging the importance of social media site separation."
Bot Detection in Wikidata Using Behavioral and Other Informal Cues,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274333,"Bots have been important to peer production's success. Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap, and Wikidata all have taken advantage of automation to perform work at a rate and scale exceeding that of human contributors. Understanding the ways in which humans and bots behave in these communities is an important topic, and one that relies on accurate bot recognition. Yet, in many cases, bot activities are not explicitly flagged and could be mistaken for human contributions. We develop a machine classifier to detect previously unidentified bots using implicit behavioral and other informal editing characteristics. We show that this method yields a high level of fitness under both formal evaluation (PR-AUC: 0.845, ROC-AUC: 0.985) and a qualitative analysis of ""anonymous"" contributor edit sessions. We also show that, in some cases, unflagged bot activities can significantly misrepresent human behavior in analyses. Our model has the potential to support future research and community patrolling activities. We built a bot detection model for Wikidata based on behavioral and other informal contribution characteristics. Our model improves upon current methods of bot recognition in peer production that rely on contributors formally and explicitly denoting bots as such. We ensured our model performed well by formally evaluating it against registered user data and by qualitatively evaluating its ability to perform with anonymous edits where formal, explicit signals for testing are not available. By applying to this latter dataset, we begin exploration into an understudied and potentially important dynamic in Wikidata and other peer production communities. Through application of our model, we find that while some studies of contributor behavior may need to be concerned about unidentified bots affecting results, most likely do not. Our findings are also important to the Wikidata community as they indicate that bot approval processes have not been completely effective. Finally, we provide our train/test data, code, and model hyper-parameters for others to use in their work."
Sociocultural Practices that Make Microfinance Work: A Case Study from Sri Lanka,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274334,"Microfinance is an inherently social process. Over the years, it has emerged as an essential means for providing financial services to the ""underbanked"" population in developing countries. This paper presents a qualitative study focused on understanding existing cooperative practices associated with microfinance in rural Sri Lanka. Through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and visits to microfinance centres, we found that microfinancing involves much more than financial transactions, rather it is strongly habituated in the sociocultural fabric of communities. Our findings show that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance. Using examples from the field, this paper discusses the importance of these factors in microfinance activities and contributes an elaborated account of cooperative practices that support microfinance processes. We also highlight how the local sociocultural structures and practices shape the way microfinance processes are being handled. We contribute towards an in-depth understanding of such practices that can be useful for microfinance institutions (MFIs) and technology designers. Consequently, we advocate for an intermediary path for technology interventions where technology and people work together rather than technology replacing people. In this paper, we presented a qualitative study conducted as a part of a larger project which aims to design technological tools to support the underbanked community from rural Sri Lanka. The objective of this study was to understand the role of sociocultural practices in supporting microfinance work. Our findings showed that there were several sociocultural practices embedded into the way microfinance sector functions in Sri Lankan rural regions and these practices play a significant role in supporting microfinance process. We gathered data by conducting semi-structured interviews, field visits and group discussions over a period of seven months. Our investigations in the microfinance sector revealed that the microfinance workflow relies heavily on several socially-habituated cooperative practices. Specifically, we identified that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance, all of which play a significant role in making microfinance work. Using examples from the field, we have illustrated the sociocultural cooperative practices of microfinance sector and how they are employed to build relationships. Even though researchers agree that microfinance is a collaborative achievement between various stakeholders, there is a need to go beyond the procedural and transaction-oriented focus on dealing with microfinance work. Based on our findings, we were able to understand the importance of human elements in the current practices of microfinance. Hence, we suggest that technology designers should focus on identifying ways where technology and people can work together instead of designing systems to replace people hoping to reduce cost and increase efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, the insights presented in this paper have not been previously reported in the domain of technology design for the underbanked. We hope that these insights will inspire technology designers to design tools that fit meaningfully with the above-studied sociocultural practices of this community which are critical to the Sri Lankan microfinance sector."
Going Beyond Obscurity: Organizational Approaches to Data Anonymization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274335,"Anonymization is viewed as a solution to over-exposure of personal information in a data-driven society. Yet how organizations apply anonymization techniques to data for regulatory, ethical or commercial reasons remains underexplored. We investigate how such measures are applied in organizations, asking whether anonymization practices are used, what approaches are considered practical and adequate, and how decisions are made to protect the privacy of data subjects while preserving analytical value. Our findings demonstrate that anonymization is applied to data far less pervasively than expected. Organizations that do employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. Rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice is a complex socio-technical process that relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations. Organizational decision-making about appropriate approaches and the management of responsibility can result in workarounds necessary to negotiate the technical complexity. Although anonymization has been featured in public discourse, emphasized in private data regulations, and emerged as an active object of academic inquiry in multiple disciplines, of the nearly 70 organizations we approached far fewer indicated that they use these approaches than we had expected. At the same time, many organizations that did engage with anonymization treated it as a sensitive topic and thus refused to answer our questions or limited the information they provided due to security concerns. Approaches to anonymization among our respondents and their reasons for granting access were diverse. They expressed significantly different opinions, echoing some of the ongoing debates about the viability of data anonymization. Perspectives ranged from general optimism about the possibilities of emergent anonymization methods to complete dismissal of conventional anonymization practices and the policies that regulate them. At the same time, even among participants that did agree to engage with our study, their willingness to disclose details of organizational anonymization approaches varied. Among those who offered complete answers, some asked for confidentiality, with their answers handled anonymously. In these cases, their disclosure of information went through a legal and security approval process. Curiously, the stated reasons for reticence in this kind of disclosure were explained less by concerns about loss of competitive advantage and more by additional security measures to limit the potential for de-identification attacks. This sort of anonymization-by-obscurity is potentially problematic and warrants deeper consideration. While some responses cited security reasons for not providing more information, reasons for treating the subject as sensitive are not easy to pinpoint. Such attitude can also be motivated by the data anonymization methods being seen as trade secrets, which could be the case for example where industrial research is being done, or alternatively by concerns about gaps between actual practices and legal or internal policies, potentially resulting in a lack of control over the data, which could negatively affect their reputation if published. To us this suggests a significant immaturity of practice and the variability of policies around application of anonymization mechanisms and disclosure of these policies troubles the expectation of trust increasingly required for the data economy to operate."
Who is Addressed in this Comment?: Automatically Classifying Meta-Comments in News Comments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274336,"User comments have become an essential part of online journalism. However, newsrooms are often overwhelmed by the vast number of diverse comments, for which a manual analysis is barely feasible. Identifying meta-comments that address or mention newsrooms, individual journalists, or moderators and that may call for reactions is particularly critical. In this paper, we present an automated approach to identify and classify meta-comments. We compare comment classification based on manually extracted features with an end-to-end learning approach. We develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple classifiers on a comment dataset of the large German online newsroom SPIEGEL Online and the ""One Million Posts"" corpus of DER STANDARD, an Austrian newspaper. Both optimized classification approaches achieved encouraging F0.5 values between 76% and 91%. We report on the most significant classification features with the results of a qualitative analysis and discuss how our work contributes to making participation in online journalism more constructive. With the emergence of user comments in online news media, news organizations are in need of tools to cope with the number of user comments. Researchers have found that journalists appreciate user feedback that, for instance, reports errors in articles, include additional information on a topic, or contain critique addressed to the quality of an article. In this paper, we present a preliminary approach to automatically identify and classify comments not (only) related to the news article but comments that address, for instance, the media company, a journalist, or a community-moderator. We call these comments “meta-comments”. By using a supervised machine learning approach, we achieved encouraging results with F0.5 scores between 76% and 91%. We found similarities between the most significant features of 2 large datasets. We computed word and comment embeddings based on 11 million German user comments for enriching text features, deriving semantic features, and transfer learning. The end-toend learning approach outperformed the traditional approach on the “One Million Posts” dataset. We gained further qualitative insights into the content of automatically identified meta-comments. Finally, in our discussion, we highlight the training of word embedding models based on user comments as an important step for applying our approach to other languages. We further discuss use-cases for stakeholders, as e.g. considering the users’ forum feature requests when further developing the news comment section."
Structure or Nurture?: The Effects of Team-Building Activities and Team Composition on Team Outcomes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274337,"How can instructors group students into teams that interact and learn effectively together? One strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with ""good"" compositions such as skill diversity. Another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. Our work synthesizes these two strands of research. We describe an experiment (N=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. In two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. Teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. We collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. Surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. Our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. We also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. We distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments. This work reported the results of an experiment comparing the effects of team formation strategies and team-building activities on team performance, satisfaction, and psychological safety in two university courses. Teams formed to achieve the composition defined by the instructor in each course did not show a statistical difference on any measure relative to teams formed randomly. This result suggests that instructors should be less concerned with fine-tuning the configuration in the tool, and should instead emphasize the value of the criteria-based approach, so that students perceive teams to be equally capable of performing well. We also found that results from industry teams (e.g., [11]) regarding psychological safety’s link to performance did not generalize to the student teams studied. This finding suggests that though activities aimed at fostering psychological safety may have practical benefits for student teams, instructors should not expect these activities to boost performance or psychological safety. More work is needed to further clarify what kinds of activities can improve psychological safety and in what contexts psychological safety impacts team performance."
Emotional Biosensing: Exploring Critical Alternatives,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274338,"Emotional biosensing is rising in daily life: Data and categories claim to know how people feel and suggest what they should do about it, while CSCW explores new biosensing possibilities. Prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. Conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. We contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. In particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. We call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, 'the good life,' and everyday experience. Emotional biosensing technologies promote a particular normative vision of ‘the good life’ limited by a focus on individual wellness, self-improvement, and workplace productivity. While there is positive potential here, these limitations point to opportunities for broadening the design space with emotional biosensing. We sketched how a broad shift from abstract representationalism to sociomaterial performativity opens critical alternatives for emotional biosensing: (Section 3.2) Rather than treating data as something immaterial to be represented, attending to the materiality of data sensing and display opens new possibilities for interpretation and experience. (3.3) Building on interpretation and experience, treating sensing/display not as passive representations but as active performances or responses offers opportunities for social meaning making and experiential, expressive displays. Emotional biosensing designs should treat affect, feeling, and emotion as embodied, dynamic, and fluid rather than abstract, static, discrete categories. (3.4) Continuing this performative shift, reframing affect from a kind of abstract information to affect as socially enacted in interaction adds sociocultural nuance to emotional biosensing. We call for humility in the emotional knowledge claims made by design, leaving more open to human interpretation, adaptation, and contestation. (3.5) Shifting further to posthumanist performativity, we outline how agential realism can help emotional biosensing designs attend to how materials shape meaning-making and prompt reflexivity about which materials, people, or categories are assumed to be separate. Attending to biopolitics (3.6) calls for embracing a diversity of voices and ways of knowing with emotional biosensing. We suggest designs with intentionally reduced authority are worth exploring, and that emotional biosensing designs can leverage negative affect as a resource for building community, support, and collective action. (3.7) Finally, reframing affect and desire as preindividual, we call for emotional biosensing designers to critically reflect on the desires our designs legitimize, and on the societal structures that make those desires seem appropriate. We argue that emotional biosensory designs should prioritize care, affirmation, respect, and recognition over self-improvement. Designs can encourage people to trust themselves to be ‘emotionally good/safe enough’ with room to explore and change rather than only seek selfimprovement according to predefined norms. More broadly, designs should explore a wide range of alternative desires with emotional biosensing."
Technology to Support Immigrant Access to Social Capital and Adaptation to a New Country,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274339,"The key to successful adaptation for immigrants in a new country is their social capital, or those resources embedded in their social networks. Research suggests that information and communication technologies (ICTs) foster immigrants' social capital and facilitate their adaptation. However, it is unclear how recent immigrants use ICTs to develop social capital and how this supports their adaptation needs. We performed semi-structured interviews with thirteen recent immigrants and five long-term immigrants. We found that ICTs and technology-mediated connections: (1) easily addressed immigrants' settlement needs, (2) minimally addressed their financial and cultural needs, and (3) were not used to address their emotional needs. To support recent immigrants' adaptation, we suggest ways for ICTs to (1) reduce uncertainty about meeting local-born populations, (2) foster reciprocity among immigrant communities, and (3) facilitate safe resource exchanges. Drawing from a series of interviews with thirteen recent immigrants and five long-term immigrants, our work provides insights into the opportunities for ICTs to support the successful adaptation of new immigrants to the U.S. We found that the recent immigrants from our study connected to public ethnic groups online to address settlement and financial needs. We also found that private online groups facilitated active resource exchange among ethnic communities, which could strengthen immigrant communities. Prior research suggests that connections to local-born populations are beneficial to thrive in a new country. Indeed, hybrid community platforms, which are typically ethnically diverse, offered opportunities for immigrants to make connections with the local-born. However, participants had lower trust in users and resources on other ICTs with ethnically diverse users such as Craigslist and PNAs. We contribute implications for strengthening relationships between immigrants and local-born populations. Building from prior research, we suggest reducing uncertainty around meeting the local-born, fostering reciprocity among immigrant communities, and facilitating safe resource exchanges."
Making a Living My Way: Necessity-driven Entrepreneurship in Resource-Constrained Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274340,"Entrepreneurship has long been used to create self-employment opportunities to guard against career uncertainty. Yet, little is known about how social technologies impact the day-to-day work of entrepreneurs in resource-constrained contexts. We performed a qualitative study involving interviews with 26 micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit and observations of entrepreneurship events. We found that micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit are often pushed into entrepreneurship in response to unexpected life disruptions, barriers to employment, and desire to benefit the community. Their resource-constrained contexts shape how they use social technologies, such as sharing economy tools and social media groups, particularly with respect to privacy, safety, and professional agency. We expand the discussion in CSCW around what it means to be an entrepreneur and provide implications for how social technologies can be designed to better meet the employment needs of people in resource-constrained communities. We performed an in-depth qualitative study involving interviews with 26 micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit and observations of entrepreneurship events. We found that micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit were driven to perform entrepreneurship given their resource-constrained conditions, which shaped how they used social technologies for business purposes. Participants adapted or avoided social technologies to meet their needs around professional agency, privacy, and local engagement. These behaviors help to inform implications for how the CSCW community can design social technologies to better meet the employment needs of those in resource-constrained contexts."
Digitizing Monetary Ecologies: Intended and Unintended Consequences of Introducing a Financial Management App in a Low-Resource Setting,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274341,"This paper reports on the changes in the monetary ecology around loan payments by auto rickshaw drivers shortly after the introduction of a mobile app in Karnataka, India. A for-profit, social enterprise facilitates loans for purchasing auto rickshaws. The mobile app was designed and implemented to provide accurate, timely loan information for drivers, to support the collaborative work of loan collection payment, and streamline the workflows of the organization. In this paper, we report on the initial experiences with the app, and argue that its introduction led to a tighter coupling of the actors involved and moved control to the back office, which especially impacted the pre- and at-transaction interactions of the monetary ecology. The paper reflects on how these changes impact adoption and use of the app and suggests a number of changes to the design which might address the observed problematics. At this stage, where the app has just been implemented, it is too early to assess and deliver a verdict upon the long-term effects of digitizing financial transactions and financial inclusion. What the case does show is that digitizing financial transactions and introducing mobile technology changed the monetary ecology in important ways. The app, together with the backend system, transformed the processes involved in loan payment workflow from disparate artefacts which provided little support for beneficiaries and intermediaries into a more coherent, accurate, up-to-date integrated system. The app also provided the opportunity for updated information to be available at-transaction. The front-end and back-ends of the ecosystem became more tightly coupled which entailed a crucial role for those in charge of the back-end system, since it controlled the updating and verifying information. Ideally, this ongoing digitizing of the ecology of monetary transactions will achieve the aim of improving the involved actors’ situation: Field agents work is supported by the app and enables them to handle more drivers and strengthen their role as ‘financial counsellors’; drivers may succeed in completing their loans and become owners of auto rickshaws more likely. TWU as a social, for-profit organization, obtains a more efficient administration, can grow and increase the number of drivers and field agents they support, and thus overall work towards improving drivers’ and field agents’ lives. However, as we have shown in the discussion of the ‘P’s, ‘2’s, of the changes in the monetary ecology, and suggestions for design implications, digitization does not do it per se, and much relies on the specific configuration of the system."
Debiasing Desire: Addressing Bias & Discrimination on Intimate Platforms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274342,"Designing technical systems to be resistant to bias and discrimination represents vital new terrain for researchers, policymakers, and the anti-discrimination project more broadly. We consider bias and discrimination in the context of popular online dating and hookup platforms in the United States, which we call intimate platforms. Drawing on work in social-justice-oriented and Queer HCI, we review design features of popular intimate platforms and their potential role in exacerbating or mitigating interpersonal bias. We argue that focusing on platform design can reveal opportunities to reshape troubling patterns of intimate contact without overriding users' decisional autonomy. We identify and address the difficult ethical questions that nevertheless come along with such intervention, while urging the social computing community to engage more deeply with issues of bias, discrimination, and exclusion in the study and design of intimate platforms. As intimate platforms grow, so does their influence on individual and structural outcomes within and beyond the intimate sphere. Intimate platforms already intervene in and mediate our private lives and decisions, and many are beginning to work toward counteracting the bias and discrimination that often manifests in our most personal interactions. Recognizing the serious challenges and opportunities presented by design practices among popular intimate platforms, we advocate for the social computing research community to engage intimate platforms as critical structures for intervening in and reflecting on issues of bias, discrimination, and exclusion. Exploring structural rather than individual interventions allows us to move beyond debates of individual preference versus discrimination, and toward conversations that are concerned with how these preferences and practices arise and are sustained. Future research in the social computing community could work towards building design mechanisms that mitigate extant forms of discrimination, developing theories and practices of design that unsettle entrenched preferences, and unpacking complex legal and policy questions about the design, operation, and role of intimate platforms."
Deliberation and Resolution on Wikipedia: A Case Study of Requests for Comments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274343,"Resolving disputes in a timely manner is crucial for any online production group. We present an analysis of Requests for Comments (RfCs), one of the main vehicles on Wikipedia for formally resolving a policy or content dispute. We collected an exhaustive dataset of 7,316 RfCs on English Wikipedia over the course of 7 years and conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis into what issues affect the RfC process. Our analysis was informed by 10 interviews with frequent RfC closers. We found that a major issue affecting the RfC process is the prevalence of RfCs that could have benefited from formal closure but that linger indefinitely without one, with factors including participants' interest and expertise impacting the likelihood of resolution. From these findings, we developed a model that predicts whether an RfC will go stale with 75.3% accuracy, a level that is approached as early as one week after dispute initiation. In this work, we provide a case study of Requests for Comment on English Wikipedia to examine online dispute resolution. We learned from interviews and qualitative analysis the reasons why many RfCs go unclosed. We identified features that distinguish formally closed RfCs and informally ended ones from ones that remained stale, achieving 75.3% accuracy. The results show that size and shape of the discussion are significant factors, along with participants’ interest and experience. We also built models to timely predict RfCs from the start of the initiation to different points in their progression, with the best model reaching above 70% after just one week."
Bridging Disconnected Knowledges for Community Health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274344,"We conducted a field study of Mohalla Clinics in Delhi (India), drawing on Haraway's work to highlight the importance of considering disparate, partial perspectives in the ecologies of such clinics. We emphasized that inadequate attention given to patients' and health workers' perspectives, and the low preparedness of the doctors at the clinics, resulted in the clinics being unable to address the needs of target patient groups. We concluded by contributing to ongoing, important conversations in the fields of ICTD, CSCW, and HCI towards redesigning healthcare interventions, revisiting patient empowerment, and redefining the role of ASHAs as infomediaries. We conducted a field study of Mohalla Clinics in Delhi (India), drawing on Haraway’s work to highlight the importance of considering disparate, partial perspectives in the ecologies of such clinics [41, 42]. We emphasized that inadequate attention given to patients’ and health workers’ perspectives, and the low preparedness of the doctors at the clinics, resulted in the clinics being unable to address the needs of target patient groups. We concluded by contributing to ongoing, important conversations in the fields of ICTD, CSCW, and HCI towards redesigning healthcare interventions, revisiting patient empowerment, and redefining the role of ASHAs as infomediaries.

Engaging Solidarity in Data Collection Practices for Community Health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274345,"Researchers and practitioners engaged in global health are increasingly turning to data-driven approaches. However, the institutionalized roles and responsibilities---as well as motivations and workflows---of those involved in data collection are not well understood. To attain a deeper understanding of the practices of frontline health workers engaged in data collection, we conducted fieldwork in underserved contexts of Delhi, India. In particular, we interviewed these workers and observed their interactions with 200 households. Our analysis takes a postcolonial feminist perspective to examine how these frontline health workers navigate the multiple demands placed on them by their families, society, local residents, and health organizations. We also discuss how they practice feminist solidarity, and distill lessons for improved data collection across global health initiatives. We conducted fieldwork to understand the roles, responsibilities, and motivations of ASHAs in an underserved setting in Delhi (India) in February 2018. We conducted interviews with seventeen ASHAs and shadowed five ASHAs to conduct participant observations, noting their interactions and data collection practices at 200 household visits. Using a postcolonial feminist lens inspired by Mohanty [53], we first documented the challenges that ASHAs faced in their day-to-day workflows for data collection. There was a mismatch between what authorities expected from the data versus the ASHAs’ ground realities, conflicting roles and responsibilities of the ASHAs, and interacting power differentials across various actors. We also examined how feminist solidarity was practiced by the ASHAs with other ASHAs, local communities, and themselves. We discussed how solidarities could be leveraged and extended through appropriate design of technology. Finally, we considered how the fields of HCI and CSCW may benefit by engaging with solidarity through design."
