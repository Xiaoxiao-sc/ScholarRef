Breaking! A Typology of Security and Privacy News and How It's Shared,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656579,"news coverage of security and privacy (s&p) events is pervasive and may affect the salience of s&p threats to the public. to better understand this coverage and its effects, we asked: what types of s&p news come into people's awareness? how do people hear about and share this news? over two years, we recruited 1999 participants to fill out a survey on emergent s&p news events. we identified four types of s&p news: financial data breaches, corporate personal data breaches, high sensitivity systems breaches, and politicized / activist cybersecurity. these event types strongly correlated with how people shared s&p news-e.g., financial data breaches were shared most (42%), while politicized / activist cybersecurity events were shared least (21%). furthermore, participants' age, gender and security behavioral intention strongly correlated with how they heard about and shared s&p news-e.g., males more often felt a personal responsibility to share, and older people were less likely to hear about s&p news through conversation. news media coverage of cybersecurity and privacy is significant and growing, and this coverage likely affects end-users’ perceptions and behaviors. to better understand what types of security and privacy news events are salient to people, we collected and analyzed 1999 survey responses for 104 distinct s&p news events over the course of two years. through this work, we made two key contributions. first, we proposed a typology of security and privacy news events. second, we presented a model of how such news events reach people, are shared by people, and how those factors correlate with people’s age, gender, security behavioral intention, and the type of news event. these contributions should help hci researchers and practitioners design solutions that address problems that everyday people find especially salient and important. for example, in the creation of systems that allow for stewardship, systems that personalize s&p recommendations to each individual based on their unique information diets, and systems that promote individual agency.",0
Deep Thermal Imaging: Proximate Material Type Recognition in the Wild through Deep Learning of Spatial Surface Temperature Patterns,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656570,"we introduce deep thermal imaging, a new approach for close-range automatic recognition of materials to enhance the understanding of people and ubiquitous technologies of their proximal environment. our approach uses a low-cost mobile thermal camera integrated into a smartphone to capture thermal textures. a deep neural network classifies these textures into material types. this approach works effectively without the need for ambient light sources or direct contact with materials. furthermore, the use of a deep learning network removes the need to handcraft the set of features for different materials. we evaluated the performance of the system by training it to recognize 32 material types in both indoor and outdoor environments. our approach produced recognition accuracies above 98% in 14,860 images of 15 indoor materials and above 89% in 26,584 images of 17 outdoor materials. we conclude by discussing its potentials for real-time use in hci applications and future directions. deep thermal imaging is a new technique to recognize materials in proximity which is based on the use of mobile thermal imaging and deep learning. to the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first demonstration that spatial thermal patterns of materials can be used to enable automatic material recognition tasks with good performances (above 89% mean accuracy from 15 indoor and 17 outdoor materials). we leveraged a mobile, low-frame rate thermal camera to build a large dataset (41,444 images) of variant thermal textures of materials. potential use cases of the systems compared with the state of the art are also discussed highlighting the potential of the system.",1
All Work and No Play?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656571,"many conversational agents (cas) are developed to answer users' questions in a specialized domain. in everyday use of cas, user experience may extend beyond satisfying information needs to the enjoyment of conversations with cas, some of which represent playful interactions. by studying a field deployment of a human resource chatbot, we report on users' interest areas in conversational interactions to inform the development of cas. through the lens of statistical modeling, we also highlight rich signals in conversational interactions for inferring user satisfaction with the instrumental usage and playful interactions with the agent. these signals can be utilized to develop agents that adapt functionality and interaction styles. by contrasting these signals, we shed light on the varying functions of conversational interactions. we discuss design implications for cas, and directions for developing adaptive agents based on users' conversational behaviors. by studying log data from a field deployment of a questionand-answer conversational agent, we characterize the rich forms of conversational interactions users had with the agent. the main areas of conversations include feedback-giving, playful chit-chat, system inquiry, and habitual communicative utterances. through the lens of statistical modeling, we highlight the rich signals in conversational interactions for inferring user satisfaction, which can be utilized to develop agents that can adapt algorithmic performances and interaction styles. the results also provide nuanced understanding on the underlying functions of conversational behaviors with qa agents and their deviations from human conversations. our findings may inform designs of cas and contribute to the emerging fields of conversational ux, conversational ir and adaptive agents.",2
Designing the Desirable Smart Home: A Study of Household Experiences and Energy Consumption Impacts,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656572,"research has shown that desirable designs shape the use and experiences people have when interacting with technology. nevertheless, how desirability influences energy consumption is often overlooked, particularly in hci studies evaluating the sustainability benefits of smart home technology. in this paper, we present a qualitative study with 23 australian households who reflect on their experiences of living with smart home devices. drawing on nelson and stolterman's concept of desiderata we develop a typology of householders' desires for the smart home and their energy implications. we structure these desires as three smart home personas: the helper, optimiser and hedonist, which align with desiderata's three approaches to desire (reason, ethics and aesthetics). we use these insights to discuss how desirability can be used within hci for steering design of the smart home towards sustainability. in this paper, we have analysed the different desires embedded in smart home technologies as interpreted by 23 participating households. drawing on nelson and stolterman’s concept of desiderata we developed a typology of different desires for the smart home. we structured these as three smart home personas: the helper, optimiser and hedonist, which align with desiderata’s three approaches to desire (reason, ethics and aesthetics). what our findings show is that different desires embedded in the smart home also shape household expectations and practices to impact energy consumption in different ways. most interestingly, these desires both compliment and contrast each other, highlighting an energy paradox in the desirable smart home. while smart home technologies afford households aesthetically pleasing experiences that reflect a modern lifestyle, they can also undermine the desire to live sustainability. based on these findings, we conclude that if designers of smart home technology seek to aspire towards sustainable change, we need to approach the desirable smart home more holistically through concepts like desiderata. towards this agenda, we suggest that hci practitioners and researchers engage with aspirations to both challenge and enhance desirable everyday experiences that also promote more sustainable energy use.",3
The Making of Performativity in Designing [with] Smart Material Composites,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656573,"as the material becomes active in disclosing the fullness of its capabilities, the boundaries between human and nonhuman performances are destabilized in productive practices that take their departure from materials. this paper illuminates the embodied crafting of action possibilities in material-driven design (mdd) practices with electroluminescent materials. the paper describes and discusses aspects of the making process of electroluminescent materials in which matter, structure, form, and computation are manipulated to deliberately disrupt the affordance of the material, with the goal to explore unanticipated action possibilities and materialize the performative qualities of the sample. in light of this account, the paper concludes by urging the hci community to performatively rupture the material, so to be able to act upon it as if it was always unfinished or underdeveloped. this, it is shown, can help open up the design space of smart material composites and reveal their latent affordances. in this paper, we have presented and discussed a number of material-driven design (mdd) explorations which take their departure from an underdeveloped smart material composite, specifically an electroluminescent material composite. these explorations are focused on the creation of electroluminescent material samples with novel action possibilities and are facilitated by the designer’s skillful engagement with the electroluminescent material. in describing the making processes, we have articulated how bodily manipulations of matter, structure, form, and computation can facilitate the emergence of certain performances. examining the explorations from the perspective of what we refer to as the ’making of performativity’ in mdd practices, the paper introduces the idea of disruption of affordance as a design strategy for working with smart material composites. we conclude by promoting how such conceptual articulation of smart materials as underdeveloped composites may unpack new ways of bringing about the performative potential of a smart material and revealing its latent affordances. in the mdd approach, as proposed, materials are understood and acted upon as always unfinished or underdeveloped. this offers hci design practice with smart material composites a better leveraging of the dynamic properties of such materials, and potentially more dynamic responses and performances by the products in which these materials may be infused.",4
Patterns for How Users Overcome Obstacles in Voice User Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656574,"voice user interfaces (vuis) are growing in popularity. however, even the most current vuis regularly cause frustration for their users. very few studies exist on what people do to overcome vui problems they encounter, or how vuis can be designed to aid people when these problems occur. in this paper, we analyze empirical data on how users (n=12) interact with our vui calendar system, discovercal, over three sessions. in particular, we identify the main obstacle categories and types of tactics our participants employ to overcome them. we analyzed the patterns of how different tactics are used in each obstacle category. we found that while nlp error obstacles occurred the most, other obstacles are more likely to frustrate or confuse the user. we also found patterns that suggest participants were more likely to employ a ""guessing"" approach rather than rely on visual aids or knowledge recall. this paper identified 4 major categories of obstacles people face when using an unfamiliar vui and 10 types of tactics they use to overcome them. we analyzed the patterns in which participants employed different tactics for each obstacle category and identified the transition patterns between tactics. in our results, the opposite tactics of simplification and use more info are the most frequently used tactics, after hyperarticulation. we found that although nlp error obstacles are the most common, the other obstacles caused more frustration and confusion to our participants. this indicates that improving vui’s ux requires further research in both nlp and in interaction design (e.g., feedback). regarding tactic patterns, our participants, even with their technical backgrounds, relied more on guessing and exploration than knowledge recall or visual aids. this highlights the need for further research on supporting user-directed exploration and learning, in addition to standard tutorial and menus in vuis. our study is limited to a small size of 36 sessions with 12 participants. future work can be extended to analyze a larger sample and different demographics; specifically examining the obstacles and tactic patterns of non-technology comfortable users. discovercal is also a vui with a visual display, certain tactics such as rely on gui will not apply to all vuis. our study analyzes data retrieved from user interactions with a single context vui (calendar management). our categories can be used to evaluate more advanced, multi-context vuis, like alexa and google assistant. these categories can also be used by vui designers to evaluate their own vui systems.",5
ThinkActive: Designing for Pseudonymous Activity Tracking in the Classroom,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656585,"we report on the design of thinkactive - a system to encourage primary aged school children to reflect on their own personal activity data in the classroom. we deployed the system with a cohort of 30 school children, over a six-week period, in partnership with an english premier league football club's health and nutrition programme. the system utilizes inexpensive activity trackers and pseudonymous avatars to promote reflection with personal data using an in-situ display within the classroom. our design explores pseudonymity as an approach to managing privacy and personal data within a public setting. we report on the motivations, challenges, and opportunities for students, teachers, and third-party providers to engage in the collection and sharing of activity data with primary school children. this paper presents the design of thinkactive - a system to support primary school students in reflecting upon their personal activity data within the classroom using pseudonymous avatars. our findings from a six week engagement brings to the fore, issues around handling sensitive personal data, engaging and designing for multiple stakeholder motivations, and promoting sociability and interaction between students around their personal data in the classroom. we hope to inspire work beyond this domain and into other complex and sensitive social contexts such as workplaces, shared housing, and social care environments.",6
Gender Recognition or Gender Reductionism?: The Social Implications of Embedded Gender Recognition Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656586,"automatic gender recognition (agr) refers to various computational methods that aim to identify an individual's gender by extracting and analyzing features from images, video, and/or audio. applications of agr are increasingly being explored in domains such as security, marketing, and social robotics. however, little is known about stakeholders' perceptions and attitudes towards agr and how this technology might disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. to begin to address these gaps, we interviewed 13 transgender individuals, including three transgender technology designers, about their perceptions and attitudes towards agr. we found that transgender individuals have overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards agr and fundamentally question whether it can accurately recognize such a subjective aspect of their identity. they raised concerns about privacy and potential harms that can result from being incorrectly gendered, or misgendered, by technology. we present a series of recommendations on how to accommodate gender diversity when designing new digital systems. with emerging technologies attempting to incorporate complex human attributes, such as gender, it is important to take into account the perspectives of diverse populations who might be directly or indirectly impacted. we studied the perceptions and attitudes of transgender individuals towards automatic gender recognition (agr), a technology that aims to classify a person’s gender based on their physical characteristics. we found that participants had overwhelmingly negative attitudes towards agr and questioned if it can offer any beneficial applications to end users. they also expressed doubt about whether agr can accurately identify gender and described the harm of being misgendered by it. finally, participants expressed serious concerns about threats that it can pose to their autonomy and privacy. we presented several recommendations for incorporating gender in system design, including informing users if their gender information would be used, giving them the option to opt out and allowing them to communicate their own gender identity to systems. with respect to agr, we are not necessarily arguing for the elimination of gender recognition from technology, but a careful consideration of the implications of incorporating it. in totality, these recommendations point towards an approach to gender that is more inclusive, collaborative and sensitive to human autonomy and choice.",7
CivilServant: Community-Led Experiments in Platform Governance,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656587,"as online platforms monitor and intervene in the daily lives of billions of people, platforms are being used to govern enduring social problems. field experiments could inform wise uses of this power if tensions between democratic values and experimentation could be resolved. in this paper, we introduce civilservant, a novel experimentation infrastructure that online communities and their moderators use to evaluate policies and replicate each others' findings. we situate civilservant in the political history of policy experiments and present design considerations for community participation, ethics, and replication. based on two case studies of community-led experiments and public debriefings on the reddit platform, we share findings on community deliberation about experiment results. we also report on uses of evidence, finding that experiments informed moderator practices, community policies, and replications by communities and platforms. we discuss the implications of these findings for evaluating platform governance in an open, democratic, experimenting society.",8
M-Kulinda: Using a Sensor-Based Technology Probe to Explore Domestic Security in Rural Kenya,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656588,"in rural kenyan households, property theft is a persistent problem. to explore how information and communication technologies (icts) may be used to address this problem we designed and deployed ""m-kulinda""-a sensor-based technology probe. we used interview, observation, diary, and data logging methods to understand 20 households' experiences using the system. our findings suggest that a probe's approach is useful in this context, more specifically we found that participants used our system in different ways to address their specific needs (e.g., monitoring poultry, electronics, and their family members). we also observed changes in our participants' understanding of sensors; m-kulinda prompted them to reflect on other areas where sensors could be used in their households. we present design implications based on these findings, and offer new perspectives on the role of technology in deterring crime. m-kulinda was successfully used to monitor participants’ homes. the use of m-kulinda in rural kenya opened new opportunities for participants to realize how sensor-based technologies can be used in their households. these opportunities deepen the hci community’s understanding of the use of sensor-based technologies for home protection in developing countries. our findings also suggest major differences from prior work [17]. we attribute this to geographical and cultural difference between rural kenya and the u.s., and to differences in users’ understanding of the technology. in developing countries like rural kenya, crime detection systems can be used to strengthen neighborhood cohesion. lastly, our findings provide direction for future research on sensor-based technologies in developing countries.",9
Nonvisual Interaction Techniques at the Keyboard Surface,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656589,"web user interfaces today leverage many common gui design patterns, including navigation bars and menus (hierarchical structure), tabular content presentation, and scrolling. these visual-spatial cues enhance the interaction experience of sighted users. however, the linear nature of screen translation tools currently available to blind users make it difficult to understand or navigate these structures. we introduce spatial region interaction techniques (sprites) for nonvisual access: a novel method for navigating two-dimensional structures using the keyboard surface. sprites 1) preserve spatial layout, 2) enable bimanual interaction, and 3) improve the end user experience. we used a series of design probes to explore different methods for keyboard surface interaction. our evaluation of sprites shows that three times as many participants were able to complete spatial tasks with sprites than with their preferred current technology. loss of spatial layout is one of the biggest challenges of nonvisual accessible technology. the impediment of not being able to understand layout deters visually impaired individuals from being fully empowered in today's digital world. in this paper, we present sprites, an inexpensive paradigm and a suite of interaction techniques that can provide nonvisual access to graphical interfaces while preserving spatial layout and improve the end user experience. our study shows that for spatial tasks sprites task completion rates are triple that of participants’ preferred access technology.",10
Admixed Portrait: Design to Understand Facebook Portrayals in New Parenthood,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656580,"we report on a design-led study of the photographic representation of self and family on facebook during and after becoming parents for the first time. our experience-centered, research-through-design study engaged eight participants across five uk homes, in a month-long deployment of a prototype technology -- a design research artifact, admixed portrait, that served to prompt participant reflection on first-time parenthood. in addition to pre- and post-deployment interviews, participants kept diaries capturing personal reflections during the deployment, on daily social media use and interactions with admixed. our qualitative insights on social media representations of transitional experience and identity for new parents, reveal how their online 'photowork' related to self-expression and social functioning. we contribute design considerations for developing tools to support photographic expression in social media use, and methodological insights about design-led inquiry for understanding transitional experiences.",11
MABLE: Mediating Young Children's Smart Media Usage with Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656581,"there has been a growing concern over the huge increase in use of smart media by young children. this study explores the possibility of using augmented-reality(ar) for regulat-ing preschoolers' media usage behavior. with mable (mobile application for behavioral learning and education), parents can provide ar-assisted feedback by changing facial expressions and sound effects. when overlaying a smart media, which has mable running, in front of a qr marker on a puppet, a facial expression is displayed on top of the puppet's face. a two-week long experiment with 36 parent-child pairs showed that compared to using just the puppet, using mable showed higher amount of engage-ment among preschoolers. for the effectiveness of parental mediation in terms of self-control, our data showed mixed results. mable had positive effects in that the amount of rule-compliance increased and problematic behaviors de-creased, whereas the level of behavioral dependency on smart media was not influenced. the result of our study shows the possibility of utilizing ar technology for parental mediation of smartphone usage. when parents used mable, an ar system, in the sum program, their children displayed higher level of engagement compared to the non-ar program. furthermore, parents reported higher mediational effectiveness using mable compared to the non-ar program, in terms of the level of rulecompliance and amount of problematic behavior. although it would be wonderful if parents can be loving, yet firm in teaching children desired developmental behaviors, the task is quite difficult. our study showed potential in aiding parents with such a task using ar. therefore, despite the aforementioned limitations of mable, the current study is meaningful in that it explored the potential role of ar in facilitating positive social and cognitive developmental behavior of preschoolers. for future work, we hope to extend the current work by exploring the possibilities of using ar in additional behavioral contexts.",12
How Relevant are Incidental Power Poses for HCI?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656582,"the concept of power pose originates from a psychology study from 2010 which suggested that holding an expansive pose can change hormone levels and increase risk-taking behavior. follow-up experiments suggested that expansive poses incidentally imposed by the design of an environment lead to more dishonest behaviors. while multiple replication attempts of the 2010 study failed, the follow-up experiments on incidental postures have so far not been replicated. as ui design in hci can incidentally lead to expansive body postures, we attempted two conceptual replications: we first asked 44 participants to tap areas on a wall-sized display and measured their self-reported sense of power; we then asked 80 participants to play a game on a large touch-screen and measured risk-taking. based on bayesian analyses we find that incidental power poses had little to no effect on our measures but could cause physical discomfort. we conclude by discussing our findings in the context of theory-driven research in hci. we investigated whether incidental postures, in particular constrictive and expansive postures, influence how users behave in human-computer interaction. the literature raised the expectation that such postures might set about cognitive and physiological reactions, most famously from findings by carney et al. [14] as well as yap et al. [65]. while the findings from carney et al. on explicitly elicited power poses did not hold up to replications, the experiments by yap et al. had so far not been replicated. we reported findings from two experiments which conceptually replicated experiments on incidental power poses in an hci context. we observed an at best small effect for felt power and an at best negligible effect for a behavioral measure for risk-taking. most surprisingly, an exploratory analysis suggested that an interaction with a personality trait, impulsiveness, might reverse the hypothesized effect for posture manipulations. however, replications controlling for this interaction are needed to determine if this interaction reliably replicates and thus poses a relevant design consideration for hci. overall we conclude that incidental power poses are unlikely to be relevant for the design of human-computer interfaces and that factors such as comfort play a much more important role.",13
Designing and Evaluating mHealth Interventions for Vulnerable Populations: A Systematic Review,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656583,"diverse disciplines, including human-computer interaction have explored how mobile health (mhealth) applications can transform healthcare and health promotion. increasingly, research has explored how mhealth tools can promote healthy behaviors within vulnerable populations-groups that disproportionately experience barriers to wellness. we conducted a systematic review of 83 papers from diverse disciplines to characterize the design and impact of mhealth tools in low-socioeconomic (low-ses) and racial/ethnic minority individuals. our findings highlight that the diversity within low-ses and racial/ethnic minority groups was not reflected in the populations studied. most studies focused on improving the health of individuals, often neglecting factors at the community and society levels that influence health disparities. moreover, few improvements in health outcomes were demonstrated. we further discuss factors that acted as barriers and facilitators of mhealth intervention adoption. our findings highlight trends that can drive critically needed digital health innovations for vulnerable populations. this systematic review reports on 83 papers focused on mhealth interventions in racial/ethnic minority and lowsocioeconomic groups. our findings reveal trends that indicate gaps in the current literature, including a need for more: in-depth formative studies, reporting of population characteristics, research on diverse subgroups, evaluation of user engagement strategies (e.g., personalization and gamification), and design and evaluation of community-level, technology-based interventions.",14
The Illusion of Control: Placebo Effects of Control Settings,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656584,"algorithmic prioritization is a growing focus for social media users. control settings are one way for users to adjust the prioritization of their news feeds, but they prioritize feed content in a way that can be difficult to judge objectively. in this work, we study how users engage with difficult-to-validate controls. via two paired studies using an experimental system -- one interview and one online study -- we found that control settings functioned as placebos. viewers felt more satisfied with their feed when controls were present, whether they worked or not. we also examine how people engage in sensemaking around control settings, finding that users often take responsibility for violated expectations -- for both real and randomly functioning controls. finally, we studied how users controlled their social media feeds in the wild. the use of existing social media controls had little impact on user's satisfaction with the feed; instead, users often turned to improvised solutions, like scrolling quickly, to see what they want. in this work, we uncovered a placebo effect for control settings on social media. while this placebo effect might suggest adding non-functional controls – or even just a quick and dirty implementation of the controls eventually desired – to increase user satisfaction, we argue here that we must look deeper. non-functional controls might suffice if social media were used solely for entertainment (as was likely the case for most of our participants). however, research has shown that social media has far greater impact, e.g., on organizing social movements [59] and news access [52]. reliance on a platform such as twitter in the context of a violent political conflict might bring high stakes to the questions of reliability and trustworthiness of control settings or of the algorithm itself. the fact that, in our work, users encountered violated expectations for both the real and the random controls suggests a potential for breakdown of trust even with the real controls. indeed, kizilcec has shown that when users’ expectations are violated, they trust systems less — unless provided some transparency [29]. while our study did not explicitly measure trust, it is an important factor when considering the impact of such a placebo effect. it is already well-established that users default to considering automated systems trustworthy [16] and may be liable to overtrusting systems [39, 40, 49]. for controls in particular, the likelihood that users accept defaults has potential negative outcomes, including forming inaccurate representations of important relationships or world events that, when acted upon, lead to misunderstanding, strained relationships, social alienation, or worse [17, 51]. with social media playing a growing role in civic and political life, surely it will become ever more important to establish not only whether these platforms are delivering what they promise, as in the growing area of work on algorithmic accountability, but how they establish trustworthiness for users. relatedly, explorations of the ethics of misrepresentative control settings might fit well within emerging conversations about the ethics of algorithmic systems [5, 11, 13, 44].",15
Easy Return: An App for Indoor Backtracking Assistance,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656595,"we present a system that, implemented as an iphone app controllable from an apple watch, can help a blind person backtrack a route taken in a building. this system requires no maps of the building or environment modifications. while traversing a path from a starting location to a destination, the system builds and records a path representation in terms of a sequence of turns and of step counts between turns. if the user wants to backtrack the same path, the system can provide assistance by tracking the user's location in the recorded path, and producing directional information in speech form about the next turns and step counts to follow. the system was tested with six blind participants in a controlled indoor experiment. we presented a novel system that can assist a blind person attempting to backtrack a path taken in a building. our easy return system was implemented as an iphone app, controlled by an apple watch. users don’t need to interact with the iphone while walking (which could be problematic when handling a long cane or a guide dog), but can keep the phone safely in their pocket. we tested our prototype system in a controlled environment with six blind participants, who walked along eight indoor paths of increasing difficulty with a sighted guide, then, for each path, attempted to return to the starting point, either by themselves, or with assistance from our backtracking system. use of our system was shown to increase the rate of complete return path traversal, but only for the more difficult routes (containing three or four turns). all of our participants except for one found great potential in the easy return concept, and were enthusiastic about the user interface designed around the apple watch.",16
Point-and-Shake: Selecting from Levitating Object Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656596,"acoustic levitation enables a radical new type of human-computer interface composed of small levitating objects. for the first time, we investigate the selection of such objects, an important part of interaction with a levitating object display. we present point-and-shake, a mid-air pointing interaction for selecting levitating objects, with feedback given through object movement. we describe the implementation of this technique and present two user studies that evaluate it. the first study found that users could accurately (96%) and quickly (4.1s) select objects by pointing at them. the second study found that users were able to accurately (95%) and quickly (3s) select occluded objects. these results show that point-and-shake is an effective way of initiating interaction with levitating object displays. we presented point-and-shake, an interaction for selecting levitating objects, combining ray-cast pointing input with object movement as feedback. it was designed with the capabilities of acoustic levitation in mind and uses only the objects for feedback. we described two studies that evaluated the performance of point-and-shake. the first investigated the effect of virtual target size when selecting levitating objects, finding that users could quickly and accurately make selections when the target size was 10mm or greater. users adapted to the increased difficulty of selecting very small targets (5mm) by moving closer to the levitating objects, which may affect acoustic levitation by reflecting sound back towards the objects. point-and-shake used a variation of the lock ray technique [5] to allow users to select occluded objects. we evaluated this aspect of the interaction in our second study, which also compared two methods for confirming selection. users could successfully select occluded objects with both methods, but especially liked quick release because of the extra control it gave them over the interaction. our studies looked at selection between two levitating objects, as the state-of-the-art in acoustic levitation does not yet allow more than two objects to be independently and reliably animated. our results suggest point-and-shake would be effective with more objects, however. they show that our shake feedback supported accurate ray aiming (study 1) and depth cursor positioning (study 2) and we expect this to also apply to more complex levitations. to conclude, we presented point, a novel interaction for selecting levitating objects, and shake, a feedback technique based on object movement. together, these allow efficient selection of mid-air objects for the first time, paving the way to more complex interactions with levitating object displays and showing the potential for interaction with this exciting new technology.",17
When David Meets Goliath: Combining Smartwatches with a Large Vertical Display for Visual Data Exploration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656597,"we explore the combination of smartwatches and a large interactive display to support visual data analysis. these two extremes of interactive surfaces are increasingly popular, but feature different characteristics-display and input modalities, personal/public use, performance, and portability. in this paper, we first identify possible roles for both devices and the interplay between them through an example scenario. we then propose a conceptual framework to enable analysts to explore data items, track interaction histories, and alter visualization configurations through mechanisms using both devices in combination. we validate an implementation of our framework through a formative evaluation and a user study. the results show that this device combination, compared to just a large display, allows users to develop complex insights more fluidly by leveraging the roles of the two devices. finally, we report on the interaction patterns and interplay between the devices for visual exploration as observed during our study. we presented a conceptual framework to support visual analysis tasks in a multi-device environment, combining two extremes of interactive surfaces: smartwatches and a large interactive display. in our framework, the devices fulfill different roles based on their strengths: the large display provides a multi-view interface, whereas the smartwatch augments and mediates the functionalities by serving as a personalized toolbox. in interplay with connective areas on the large display, the smartwatch supports exploration based on sets of both data items and visualization properties, which can be stored, manipulated, previewed, as well as applied permanently. we evaluated our prototype implementation to find interaction patterns with increased movements as well as evidence of the effectiveness of this specific device combination. with this work, we provide a starting point for this promising new class of multi-device environments, which we believe are strongly beneficial for visual analysis tasks and also beyond.",18
SteeringWheel: A Locality-Preserving Magnification Interface for Low Vision Web Browsing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656598,"low-vision users struggle to browse the web with screen magnifiers. firstly, magnifiers occlude significant portions of the webpage, thereby making it cumbersome to get the webpage overview and quickly locate the desired content. further, magnification causes loss of spatial locality and visual cues that commonly define semantic relationships in the page; reconstructing semantic relationships exclusively from narrow views dramatically increases the cognitive burden on the users. secondly, low-vision users have widely varying needs requiring a range of interface customizations for different page sections; dynamic customization in extant magnifiers is disruptive to users' browsing. we present steeringwheel, a magnification interface that leverages content semantics to preserve local context. in combination with a physical dial, supporting simple rotate and press gestures, users can quickly navigate different webpage sections, easily locate desired content, get a quick overview, and seamlessly customize the interface. a user study with 15 low-vision participants showed that their web-browsing efficiency improved by at least 20 percent with steeringwheel compared to extant screen magnifiers. this paper presents the design, implementation and a user study of steeringwheel, a locality-preserving magnification interface, using an off-the-shelf physical dial for low-vision web browsing. our study findings indicate that the constructive synergy between the dial, the ls hierarchy of the webpage, and locality preservation in steeringwheel, makes for a better user experience compared to extant screen magnifiers. in future, we plan to continue work on the space reduction algorithm for small-screen devices such as smartphones and release the algorithm as a browser plug-in so that users can use it as a lightweight magnifier.",19
Extending Keyboard Shortcuts with Arm and Wrist Rotation Gestures,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656599,"we propose and evaluate a novel interaction technique to enhance physical keyboard shortcuts with arm and wrist rotation gestures, performed during keypresses: rolling the wrist, rotating the arm/wrist, and lifting it. this extends the set of shortcuts from key combinations (e.g. ctrl + v) to combinations of key(s) and gesture (e.g. v + roll left) and enables continuous control. we implement this approach for isolated single keypresses, using inertial sensors of a smartwatch. we investigate key aspects in three studies: 1) rotation flexibility per keystroke finger, 2) rotation control, and 3) user-defined gesture shortcuts. as a use case, we employ our technique in a painting application and assess user experience. overall, results show that arm and wrist rotations during keystrokes can be used for interaction, yet challenges remain for integration into practical applications. we discuss recommendations for applications and ideas for future research. we proposed and evaluated arm and wrist rotation gestures to extend keyboard interaction. these gestures are performed while pressing a key. they extend the set of possible shortcuts and enable continuous control along multiple axes. thus, our concept increases expressiveness of keyboard interaction. we implemented this concept for isolated single keypresses, using smartwatch sensors, and investigated four key aspects: 1) rotation flexibility per keystroke finger, 2) rotation control, 3) user-defined gesture shortcuts, and 4) user experience. we found that users can control rotations with useful accuracy and ranges for interaction. however, we also revealed challenges: in particular, rotation shortcuts did not outperform normal ones in our case study and elicited assignments indicated that gesture mappings might not be obvious without supporting users in discovering and learning them. nevertheless, overall we conclude that arm and wrist rotations during keystrokes can be used to extend keyboard interaction and shortcuts, and offer a promising direction for future work.",20
IntroAssist: A Tool to Support Writing Introductory Help Requests,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656590,"writing introductory help requests is a key part of develop-ing new professional connections, such as through email and other online messaging systems. this paper presents the design and an experimental evaluation of introassist-a web-based tool that leverages cognitive apprenticeship in-structional methods to support writing introductory help requests through an expert-informed checklist, tagged peer examples, self-tagging, and suggested word limit. in a study of introassist with novice entrepreneurs, we find that 1) expert raters consider help requests written with the tool as more effective, 2) participants are able to perform introduc-tory help seeking skills after the tool is removed, and 3) participants report being more likely to send help requests written with the tool. we present implications for the de-velopment of systems that support the initiation of profes-sional relationships. based on a review of help seeking literature and our empirical studies, we argue that computer-mediated communication systems should be designed to support users beyond recommending new connections. they must also help users to communicate in the first place. introassist provides an opportunity to facilitate the initiation of professional connections through written introductory help request by providing an expert-informed checklist, tagged peer examples, self-tagging, and suggested word limit. we find that expert raters consider help requests written with introassist as more effective than those written without, participants are able to perform introductory help seeking skills after the tool is removed, and participants report being more likely to send help requests written with the tool. with greater skills and confidence in performing introductory help seeking, people can more effectively leverage the myriad connections internet technologies have come to offer.",21
Surprise Me If You Can: Serendipity in Health Information,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656591,"our natural tendency to be curious is increasingly important now that we are exposed to vast amounts of information. we often cope with this overload by focusing on the familiar: information that matches our expectations. in this paper we present a framework for interactive serendipitous information discovery based on a computational model of surprise. this framework delivers information that users were not actively looking for, but which will be valuable to their unexpressed needs. we hypothesize that users will be surprised when presented with information that violates the expectations predicted by our model of them. this surprise model is balanced by a value component which ensures that the information is relevant to the user. within this framework we have implemented two surprise models, one based on association mining and the other on topic modeling approaches. we evaluate these two models with thirty users in the context of online health news recommendation. positive user feedback was obtained for both of the computational models of surprise compared to a baseline random method. this research contributes to the understanding of serendipity and how to ""engineer"" serendipity that is favored by users. this study presents a framework that models the concept of serendipity as a combination of surprise and value. the framework was implemented using two computational approaches to predicting user surprise, which were then evaluated in a user study. our results show that the mi, approach based on topic co-occurrence outperformed the kl approach and our random baseline in predicting when users would rate a document as surprising and serendipitous. as to the broader impact, this work addresses a core problem of accuracy-oriented search and recommender systems. serendipitous retrieval has the potential to transform the way digital systems deliver information by shifting from reinforcing similar information to facilitating unexpected discoveries. this will provide users with expanded access to information that is surprising, yet beneficial. this to a variety of domains that can benefit from such a model.",22
Awe the Audience: How the Narrative Trajectories Affect Audience Perception in Public Speaking,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656592,"telling a great story often involves a deliberate alteration of emotions. in this paper, we objectively measure and analyze the narrative trajectories of stories in public speaking and their impact on subjective ratings. we conduct the analysis using the transcripts of over 2000 ted talks and estimate potential audience response using over 5 million spontaneous annotations from the viewers. we use ibm watson tone analyzer to extract sentence-wise emotion, language, and social scores. our study indicates that it is possible to predict (with auc as high as 0.88) the subjective ratings of the audience by analyzing the narrative trajectories. additionally, we find that some trajectories (for example, a flat trajectory of joy) correlate well with some specific ratings (e.g. ""longwinded') assigned by the viewers. such an association could be useful in forecasting audience responses using objective analysis. in summary, we strive to analyze if the narrative trajectories exist in public speaking and if it has any impact on the audience ratings. our analysis reveals the existence of several major patterns (clusters) in narrative trajectories. the clusters show statistically significant differences in the audience ratings. the relation of audience ratings with the narrative trajectories provides insights on the behavior of the audience. the results could motivate future research on determining the cause of such audience responses. additionally, the narrative trajectories and the corresponding cluster analyses were computed objectively in an automated analysis technique. this kind of experiment is reproducible, scalable, and its generalization verifiable over different domains. objective analysis also makes it possible to build computer algorithms that could automatically predict audience responses from analyzing the transcripts. this approach could potentially be useful in building automated systems to help people practice and prepare their own public speeches. to validate this claim, we attempted classification and regression tasks using features collected from narrative trajectories and off-the-shelf prediction techniques. our results show that even these simple techniques could discriminate between highly rated and poorly rated ted talks with accuracy as high as 80% (auc 0.88) which is much higher than random chance. finally, it is likely that the speakers communicate additional information or inspire deeper connection to the audience through skillful prosody, facial expressions, and gestures. these parameters could impact the way the audience rates a speech. our analyses and insights in this paper are limited to only the spoken sentences, and not the nonverbal features. it remains part of our future work.",23
Introducing Transient Gestures to Improve Pan and Zoom on Touch Surfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656593,"despite the ubiquity of touch-based input and the availability of increasingly computationally powerful touchscreen devices, there has been comparatively little work on enhancing basic canonical gestures such as swipe-to-pan and pinch-to-zoom. in this paper, we introduce transient pan and zoom, i.e. pan and zoom manipulation gestures that temporarily alter the view and can be rapidly undone. leveraging typical touchscreen support for additional contact points, we design our transient gestures such that they co-exist with traditional pan and zoom interaction. we show that our transient pan-and-zoom reduces repetition in multi-level navigation and facilitates rapid movement between document states. we conclude with a discussion of user feedback, and directions for future research. standard pan-and-zoom techniques suffer from inefficiencies, and often require excessive repeated transitions when performing tasks that require constant transitions between multiple resolutions and locations in a zoomable interface. we introduce a transient technique that expands the design of standard pan-and-zoom interaction to include the fluid movement between states to reduce the need for repetitive zooming to revisit previous states. in an experiment with 18 participants, we demonstrate that our technique requires 57.6% fewer zoom actions than standard pan-and-zoom, for an overall 17.3% improvement in task completion times. transient pan-and-zoom is comparable to double-tap in ease-of-use and performance, but is found to be more effective than double-tap and preferred by our participants for navigation tasks.",24
MirrorMirror: A Mobile Application to Improve Speechreading Acquisition,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656594,"many people around the world have difficulties in day-to-day conversation due to hearing loss. hearing aids often fail to offer enough benefits and have low adoption rates. however, people with hearing loss find that speechreading can improve their understanding during conversation, but speechreading is a challenging skill to learn. speechreading classes can improve acquisition, however there are a limited number of classes available and students can only practice effectively when attending class. to address this, we conducted a postal survey with 59 speechreading students to understand students' perspectives on practicing. using our findings, we developed an android application called mirrormirror - a new speechreading acquisition tool (sat) that allows students to practice their speechreading by recording and watching videos of people they frequently speak with. we evaluated mirrormirror through three case studies with speechreading students and found that they could effectively target their speechreading practice on people, words and situations they encounter during daily conversations. speechreading can help people with hearing loss improve understanding during conversation, but is a challenging skill to acquire. current speechreading acquisition tools (sats) are not adaptable to individual student needs unlike speechreading classes. to address the limitations of current approaches, we conducted a postal questionnaire with students from four speechreading classes to gather requirements for a new sat called mirrormirror. mirrormirror allows speechreaders to practice lipshapes and words by recording videos of people they frequently talk to. we evaluated mirrormirror through three case studies with speechreading students and found that it improved participants’ ability to practice outside of classes. our future work is focussed on expanding mirrormirror with a new practice mode based on sentences and allowing users to share their library of videos with each other.",25
Hybrid-Brailler: Combining Physical and Gestural Interaction for Mobile Braille Input and Editing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656505,"braille input enables fast nonvisual entry speeds on mobile touchscreen devices. yet, the lack of tactile cues commonly results in typing errors, which are hard to correct. we propose hybrid-brailler, an input solution that combines physical and gestural interaction to provide fast and accurate braille input. we use the back of the device for physical chorded input while freeing the touchscreen for gestural interaction. gestures are used in editing operations, such as caret movement, text selection, and clipboard control, enhancing the overall text entry experience. we conducted two user studies to assess both input and editing performance. results show that hybrid-brailler supports fast entry rates as its virtual counterpart, while significantly increasing input accuracy. regarding editing performance, when compared with the mainstream technique, hybrid-brailler shows performance benefits of 21% in speed and increased editing accuracy. we finish with lessons learned for designing future nonvisual input and editing techniques. we have presented hybrid-brailler, a system that combines physical and gestural interaction for braille input. the prototype can be attached to mobile touchscreen devices to enhance their typing experience. hybrid-brailler allows blind users to leverage physical buttons, on the back of the device, to input braille characters while freeing the touchscreen for editing operations. results show that hybrid-brailler is significantly more accurate than its virtual counterpart while maintaining the same entry rate in typing tasks. moreover, in a performance comparison to the default editing technique of android 5.1, hybrid-brailler was significantly faster and three times more accurate. further work is needed to improve our prototype by building slim and ergonomic components. additionally, future research should focus on improving touchscreenbased editing techniques, particularly text selection and clipboard operations. devising novel nonvisual feedback mechanisms will likely play a crucial role in improving error detection and editing awareness. overall, users acknowledged the benefit of augmenting current “flat surfaces” of mobile devices with tactile cues, particularly in data entry tasks. such approach can be extended to other tasks beyond text entry and be leveraged as an enhancement method for mobile devices. do-ityourself movements, 3d-printed technologies, and modular phones will play a crucial role in promoting this culture of inclusion and personalized computing.",26
Flexible and Mindful Self-Tracking: Design Implications from Paper Bullet Journals,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656506,"digital self-tracking technologies offer many potential benefits over self-tracking with paper notebooks. however, they are often too rigid to support people's practical and emotional needs in everyday settings. to inform the design of more flexible self-tracking tools, we examine bullet journaling: an analogue and customisable approach for logging and reflecting on everyday life. analysing a corpus of paper bullet journal photos and related conversations on instagram, we found that individuals extended and adapted bullet journaling systems to their changing practical and emotional needs through: (1) creating and combining personally meaningful visualisations of different types of trackers, such as habit, mood, and symptom trackers; (2) engaging in mindful reflective thinking through design practices and self-reflective strategies; and (3) posting photos of paper journals online to become part of a self-tracking culture of sharing and learning. we outline two interrelated design directions for flexible and mindful self-tracking: digitally extending analogue self-tracking and supporting digital self-tracking as a mindful design practice. the design of self-tracking technologies tends to be predefined and, therefore, often fails to support people’s practical goals, emotional needs, and changes in individual living circumstances [22,36,38]. to inform the design of more flexible self-tracking tools, we have examined the analogue and customisable bullet journaling approach for tracking, organising, and planning [7]. analysing a corpus of paper bullet journal photos and related conversations on instagram, we found that individuals extended and adapted bullet journaling systems to meet their practical and emotional needs in everyday life. they crafted and combined personally meaningful textual, numeric, and symbolic representations of different types of trackers (e.g. habit, mood, and symptom trackers). through design practices and self-reflective strategies, they engaged in mindful reflective thinking, and posted photos of their paper journals online to become part of a visual selftracking culture of sharing and learning. based on this understanding, we have discussed two interrelated design directions for flexible and mindful self-tracking: digitally extending analogue self-tracking with additional values, rather than replacing the use of pencil and paper, and supporting digital self-tracking as a mindful design practice, as opposed to concentrating only on passive automation and a predefined presentation of personal data.",27
Predicting Human Performance in Vertical Menu Selection Using Deep Learning,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656507,"predicting human performance in interaction tasks allows designers or developers to understand the expected performance of a target interface without actually testing it with real users. in this work, we present a deep neural net to model and predict human performance in performing a sequence of ui tasks. in particular, we focus on a dominant class of tasks, i.e., target selection from a vertical list or menu. we experimented with our deep neural net using a public dataset collected from a desktop laboratory environment and a dataset collected from hundreds of touchscreen smartphone users via crowdsourcing. our model significantly outperformed previous methods on these datasets. importantly, our method, as a deep model, can easily incorporate additional ui attributes such as visual appearance and content semantics without changing model architectures. by understanding about how a deep learning model learns from human behaviors, our approach can be seen as a vehicle to discover new patterns about human behaviors to advance analytical modeling. we presented a deep learning approach for modeling user performance for menu selection, a dominant task in modern interfaces. our model is highly extensible. it can accommodate various ui aspects without changing the model architecture or using extensive domain knowledge. it outperformed a previous method on predicting performance time based on a public dataset and a large-scale smartphone dataset. we discussed an analysis of the model behaviors, which revealed new findings about how past experience of the user has an influence on the user performance with regard to different menu organizations. we contributed a set of knowledge and technical details about how to design, train and analyze a deep model for performance modeling.",28
Customizing Hybrid Products,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656508,"we explore how the convergence of the digital and physical into hybrid products leads to new possibilities for customization. we report on a technology probe, a hybrid advent calendar with both paper form and digital layers of content, both of which were designed to be customizable. we reveal how over two hundred active users adapted its physical and digital aspects in various ways, some anticipated and familiar, but others surprising. this leads us to contribute concepts to help understand and design for hybrid customization -- the idea of broad customization spanning physical and digital; end-to-end customization by different stakeholders along the value chain for a product; and the combination of these into customization maps. even though our advent-calendar is a relatively simple paperbased example of a hybrid product, it has revealed a wide range of possibilities for customization. we saw broad customization of both its physical and digital aspects. we also saw end-to-end customization in which various stakeholders along its value chain added value. drawing these two observations together led to the concept of customization maps as a way of charting the various ways in which a hybrid product might potentially be customized. how might these ideas apply to other kinds of hybrid product, especially to more technically sophisticated ones? consider the motorcar as an example. cars have traditionally been physical products. however, over recent years they have become hybrid products, not only in the sense of hybrid engines, but also in the meaning of this paper – that they are now a mixture of physical and digital materials. the modern car includes a software engine management system as well as software services for navigation, communications and entertainment. customization has long been part of the motor industry, from custom hand-built cars, to allowing consumers to choose their own interiors, fittings and options, to specialized custom shops. customization can now be broadened to include the digital behaviour of the car, for example configuring different engine settings in software to provide sports or economy modes, and the possibilities will only increase as cars become more autonomous, including learning and adapting to their driver’s behaviour. applying the concept of custom maps to a car encourages one to consider a wide range of possibilities for both physical and digital customization and also which stakeholders along its value chain can undertake these. what do manufacturers customize? what further value might dealers add through further customizations and what can consumers customize for themselves? equally, as car is a safety-critical product, unlike an advent calendar, what customization are not appropriate for different stakeholders? it is beyond the remit of this paper to undertake a detailed analysis of this or other similar examples. however, by raising a somewhat extreme example of an emerging hybrid product we hope to suggest that the lessons learned from a simple paper-based technology probe may ultimately be more widely applicable to many future kinds of hybrid products that will soon enter our lives.",29
Fingers' Range and Comfortable Area for One-Handed Smartphone Interaction Beyond the Touchscreen,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656509,"previous research and recent smartphone development presented a wide range of input controls beyond the touchscreen. fingerprint scanners, silent switches, and back-of-device (bod) touch panels offer additional ways to perform input. however, with the increasing amount of input controls on the device, unintentional input or limited reachability can hinder interaction. in a one-handed scenario, we conducted a study to investigate the areas that can be reached without losing grip stability (comfortable area), and with stretched fingers (maximum range) using four different phone sizes. we describe the characteristics of the comfortable area and maximum range for different phone sizes and derive four design implications for the placement of input controls to support one-handed bod and edge interaction. amongst others, we show that the index and middle finger are the most suited fingers for bod interaction and that the grip shifts towards the top edge with increasing phone sizes. in this paper, we investigated the areas which are reachable without changing the hand grip or losing grip stability (comfortable area) and the coverable range when fingers are fully stretched (maximum range). we conducted a lab study in which participants were recorded by a high-precision motion capture system while performing finger movements on four differently sized smartphones. we presented the average maximum range and the comfortable area which can inform the design of one-handed interaction on the back and edge of the device for a wide range of smartphone sizes. based on the results, we derived four design implications that can help designers to place input controls so that users can interact with them one-handedly. particularly, they help to chi 2018 paper chi 2018, april 21–26, 2018, montréal, qc, canada paper 31 page 8 find suitable placements of input controls that do not require a change of hand grip or a loss of grip stability which could lead to dropping the device or muscle strain. amongst others, the key findings include using the index and middle finger for back-of-device (bod) interaction since they are the most flexible fingers and the shift of the hand grip towards the top edge with increasing device sizes. while we derived common design implications for one-handed smartphone interaction, future research should follow up on our analysis on the impact of different hand sizes on the finger range and comfortable area. resulting findings could be used to propose design implications for specific hand sizes (e.g., smartphones for children). moreover, the comfortable area and maximum range can be explored for specific types of input controls. while touching a button is usually done with an angled finger, fingerprint scanners require a flat placement of the finger. investigating one specific type of input control would limit the result’s generalizability due to constraints such as specific finger angles. however, the results can be more precise when only a certain type of input control is used.",30
Exploration and Explanation in Computational Notebooks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656500,"computational notebooks combine code, visualizations, and text in a single document. researchers, data analysts, and even journalists are rapidly adopting this new medium. we present three studies of how they are using notebooks to document and share exploratory data analyses. in the first, we analyzed over 1 million computational notebooks on github, finding that one in four had no explanatory text but consisted entirely of visualizations or code. in a second study, we examined over 200 academic computational notebooks, finding that although the vast majority described methods, only a minority discussed reasoning or results. in a third study, we interviewed 15 academic data analysts, finding that most considered computational notebooks personal, exploratory, and messy. importantly, they typically used other media to share analyses. these studies demonstrate a tension between exploration and explanation in constructing and sharing computational notebooks. we conclude with opportunities to encourage explanation in computational media without hindering exploration. computational notebooks address many fundamental challenges with performing, documenting, and sharing data analyses. they support incremental and iterative analyses, enabling users to edit, arrange, and execute small blocks of code in any order. they enable explanation of thought processes by allowing analysts to intersperse code with richly formatted textual explanations. they facilitate sharing by combining code, visualizations, and text in a single document that can be posted online or emailed. some computational notebooks are truly remarkable in the way they elegantly explain complex analyses [16].",31
Multi-Touch Skin: A Thin and Flexible Multi-Touch Sensor for On-Skin Input,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656501,"skin-based touch input opens up new opportunities for direct, subtle, and expressive interaction. however, existing skin-worn sensors are restricted to single-touch input and limited by a low resolution. we present the first skin overlay that can capture high-resolution multi-touch input. our main contributions are: 1) based on an exploration of functional materials, we present a fabrication approach for printing thin and flexible multi-touch sensors for on-skin interactions. 2) we present the first non-rectangular multi-touch sensor overlay for use on skin and introduce a design tool that generates such sensors in custom shapes and sizes. 3) to validate the feasibility and versatility of our approach, we present four application examples and empirical results from two technical evaluations. they confirm that the sensor achieves a high signal-to-noise ratio on the body under various grounding conditions and has a high spatial accuracy even when subjected to strong deformations. we have presented the first method that allows interaction designers to design and fabricate functional and high-resolution multi-touch sensor skins for the body. this includes a design tool that assists the designer in generating sensors of custom and non-rectangular shape, and the first technique for printing a mutual-capacitance sensor on a commodity inkjet printer. a set of functional sensors and practical application examples, as well as results from two technical studies demonstrate the sensor’s functionality on the human body, in various scales, and when undergoing significant deformation. promising avenues for future work comprise advanced design tools for the body and simultaneous sensing of multiple modalities.",32
Improving Comprehension of Measurements Using Concrete Re-expression Strategies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656502,"it can be difficult to understand physical measurements (e.g., 28 lb, 600 gallons) that appear in news stories, data reports, and other documents. we develop tools that automatically re-express unfamiliar measurements using the measurements of familiar objects. our work makes three contributions: (1) we identify effectiveness criteria for objects used in concrete measurement re-expressions; (2) we operationalize these criteria in a scalable method for mining a large dataset of concrete familiar objects with their physical dimensions from amazon and wikipedia; and (3) we develop automated concrete re-expression tools that implement three common re-expression strategies (adding familiar context, reunitization and proportional analogy) as energy minimization algorithms. crowdsourced evaluations of our tools indicate that people find news articles with re-expressions more helpful and re- expressions help them to better estimate new measurements. we presented a set of tools for automatically re-expressing unfamiliar measurements using the measurements of familiar objects. the key idea of our approach is to identify criteria for effective re-expressions then build a database of familiar objects and their measurements by combining information from semantic databases, object databases and crowdsourcing. we show the database can be used to implement three common re-expression strategies. our tools make it easier for publishers, educators, or journalists to enhance their audience’s understanding of measurements through concrete measurement re-expressions in various informal and educational contexts.",33
Understanding the Needs of Searchers with Dyslexia,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656503,"as many as 20% of english speakers have dyslexia, a language disability that impacts reading and spelling. web search is an important modern literacy skill, yet the accessibility of this language-centric endeavor to people with dyslexia is largely unexplored. we interviewed ten adults with dyslexia and conducted an online survey with 81 dyslexic and 80 non-dyslexic adults, in which participants described challenges they face in various stages of web search (query formulation, search result triage, and information extraction). we also report the findings of an online study in which 174 adults with dyslexia and 172 without dyslexia rated the readability and relevance of sets of search query results. our findings demonstrate differences in behaviors and preferences between dyslexic and non-dyslexic searchers, and indicate that factoring readability into search engine rankings and/or interfaces may benefit both dyslexic and non-dyslexic users. in this paper, we identified that web search accessibility for people with dyslexia is an important and largely unaddressed challenge for the hci and information retrieval communities. by conducting and analyzing interviews with ten adults with dyslexia as well as an online survey with 80 dyslexic and 81 non-dyslexic adults, we found that people with dyslexia experience challenges in finding information through web search relating to all stages of the information seeking process. we also conducted an online study in which 174 dyslexic and 172 non-dyslexic adults rated the readability and relevance of search results. from these studies, we identified several aspects of query formulation, results triage, and information extraction that are challenging for people with dyslexia, and found marked differences in dyslexic and non-dyslexic adults’ search behaviors. reflecting on these findings, we proposed several design suggestions for improving both search interfaces and search algorithms. these findings and design implications open new avenues for further research on improving the accessibility of information seeking and, more generally, the web, for people with reading disabilities.",34
Evaluation Strategies for HCI Toolkit Research,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656504,"toolkit research plays an important role in the field of hci, as it can heavily influence both the design and implementation of interactive systems. for publication, the hci community typically expects toolkit research to include an evaluation component. the problem is that toolkit evaluation is challenging, as it is often unclear what 'evaluating' a toolkit means and what methods are appropriate. to address this problem, we analyzed 68 published toolkit papers. from our analysis, we provide an overview of, reflection on, and discussion of evaluation methods for toolkit contributions. we identify and discuss the value of four toolkit evaluation strategies, including the associated techniques that each employs. we offer a categorization of evaluation strategies for toolkit researchers, along with a discussion of the value, potential limitations, and trade-offs associated with each strategy. research toolkits have fundamentally influenced and shaped the way interactive technology is built, and will continue to do so. despite the impact and success of toolkits, evaluating them remains a challenge. this paper is a first attempt at clarifying what evaluation methods are used, when they are appropriate and how they are performed. we derived four evaluation types and associated techniques for hci toolkits based on 68 toolkit papers. we hope our categorization and reflection helps strengthen methods for toolkit research and move technical hci research forward.",35
TopoText: Context-Preserving Text Data Exploration Across Multiple Spatial Scales,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656515,"topotext is a context-preserving technique for visualizing text data for multi-scale spatial aggregates to gain insight into spatial phenomena. conventional exploration requires users to navigate across multiple scales but only presents the information related to the current scale. this limitation potentially adds more steps of interaction and cognitive overload to the users. topotext renders multi-scale aggregates into a single visual display combining novel text-based encoding and layout methods that draw labels along the boundary or filled within the aggregates. the text itself not only summarizes the semantics at each individual scale, but also indicates the spatial coverage of the aggregates and their underlying hierarchical relationships. we validate topotext with both a user study as well as several application examples. we have presented a text-based visualization technique called topotext for maintaining the semantic context in the multiscale aggregation space. our primary contribution includes a set of visual encoding and layout strategies that spatialize visual text labels on the boundary or in the inner space of the aggregates. we have explored and evaluated several design choices that utilize different visual attributes of text labels including color, opacity, density and orientation for multiscale text exploration tasks. our future work includes optimizing the rendering performance of topotext by precomputing the visualizations and organizing them as map tiles. we also plan on extending topotext to supporting other types of spatial data, or non-spatial data that can be spatialized in a meaningful way. finally, we plan on extending topotext to exploring the multi-scale aggregation dynamics in real-time applications.",36
Design Patterns for Data Comics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656516,"data comics for data-driven storytelling are inspired by the visual language of comics and aim to communicate insights in data through visualizations. while comics are widely known, few examples of data comics exist and there has not been any structured analysis nor guidance for their creation. we introduce data-comic design-patterns, each describing a set of panels with a specific narrative purpose, that allow for rapid storyboarding of data comics while showcasing their expressive potential. our patterns are derived from i) analyzing common patterns in infographics, datavideos, and existing data comics, ii) our experiences creating data comics for different scenarios. our patterns demonstrate how data comics allow an author to combine the best of both worlds: spatial layout and overview from infographics as well as linearity and narration from videos and presentations. in this paper, we introduced design patterns for data comics, a novel but scarcely explored genre. we demonstrated design patterns that assist in storyboarding data comics and developing about their expressiveness and potential. however, as comics combine aspects of communication through space and elements from temporal narration, the boundaries with other genres such as infographics and videos or presentations are somewhat fuzzy, thus requiring more research. our patterns are inspired from and apply to other genres to some extent, while describing a common design space for presentation in data-driven storytelling. we believe data comics and our design patterns will inform future interfaces. they furthermore can change the way we conceptualize and create infographics and presentations, as comics provide a unique way of translating narrative practices and aspects from one medium to the other. overall, we found data comics to be an engaging way to teach students about data, visualization, the art of storytelling, as well as the need for effective communication based on the evidence in data. we hope our patterns will help designers, data scientists, data journalists, and everyone else engaged in presenting data to create novel data comics and find new ways to express data.",37
"Practices and Technology Needs of a Network of Farmers in Tharaka Nithi, Kenya",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656517,"farmers in rural areas of kenya generally rely on traditional agricultural practices inherited from past generations. however, population increases and climate changes have put pressure on resources such as land and water. these resource pressures have created a need to broaden and expand farming practices. we conducted an exploratory study with farmers in tharaka nithi, kenya to explore their practices, if and how they used ict, and how the technologies used might be designed to aid their practices, if at all. overall, our results show that farmers desired more knowledge to enable them apply ict interventions in ways that improved yields. farmers were also interested in accessing information on soil fertility, water predictability and market opportunities. these findings suggest opportunities for technology design to support farming practices among rural communities in rural settings. we also articulate social challenges that designers will face when thinking about coming up with such solutions. our paper explores factors shaping how and why rural farmers in kenya use technology while connecting their routine farming activities. we found that farmers generally relied on traditional farming practices and mainly used mobile phones to share information around learning about better farming practices and markets for their produce. the participants also indicated interest in technology solutions that could provide information on soil fertility, support equitable distribution of irrigation water and also connect farmers with potential buyers. even though a considerable number of our participants were not technology savvy, our results point to ways through which collaborative technology such as mobile phone chat applications could be leveraged to promote information sharing in rural farming communities where persistent disparities in terms of income and access to financial support opportunities are prevalent. ultimately, we hope this study will inspire future research into how collaborative technologies might be better designed and be more meaningfully situated within rural farming communities in developing countries.",38
Design for Collaborative Survival: An Inquiry into Human-Fungi Relationships,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656518,"in response to recent calls for hci to address ongoing environmental crises and existential threats, this paper introduces the concept of collaborative survival and examines how it shapes the design of interactive artifacts. collaborative survival describes how our (human) ability to persist as a species is deeply entangled with and dependent upon the health of a multitude of other species. we explore collaborative survival within the context of designing tools for mushroom foraging and reflect on how interactive products can open new pathways for noticing and joining-with these entanglements towards preferable futures. in addition to highlighting three tactics-engagement, attunement and expansion-that can guide designs towards multispecies flourishing, our prototypes illustrate the potential for wearable technology to extend the body into the environment. in this paper, we introduce the metaphor of collaborative survival to describe how human life is dependent and entangled upon the health of other species. we then situate the collaborative survival within existing hci research as a way to address related work and also to see where it can contribute in the realm of design. we then describe prototypes (hsi, data harvest, and spore stepper) that seek to re-envision human-fungi relationships in the context of a mushroom foray as examples of how collaborative survival can be implemented in design. three concepts emerged from these designs, engagement, attunement and expansion that provoke acts of noticing, an important tenet of collaborative survival. the process of building tools for collaborative survival shows potential as ways of how wearables can be used to reshape our perspectives of natural systems. in building these objects around the practice of forays used in mycology, the study of fungi, not just as contextual framing but as extended metaphor, these objects pose to become a step towards forming these alternative mutualistic relationships with humans and nonhuman others using technology. speculative yet plausible, critical yet pragmatic, the tools suggest for a future that can already exist here and now.",39
“An Odd Kind of Pleasure”: Differentiating Emotional Challenge in Digital Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656519,"recent work introduced the notion of emotional challenge as a means to afford more unique and diverse gaming experiences. however, players' experience of emotional challenge has received little empirical attention. it remains unclear whether players enjoy it and what exactly constitutes the challenge thereof. we surveyed 171 players about a challenging or an emotionally challenging experience, and analyzed their responses with regards to what made the experience challenging, their emotional response, and the relation to core player experience constructs. we found that emotional challenge manifested itself in different ways, by confronting players with difficult themes or decisions, as well as having them deal with intense emotions. in contrast to more'conventional' challenge, emotional challenge evoked a wider range of negative emotions and was appreciated significantly more by players. our findings showcase the appeal of uncomfortable gaming experiences, and extend current conceptualizations of challenge in games. emotional challenge has been suggested to afford more unique and diverse gaming experiences, beyond traditional notions of challenge in games. yet the concept has to date never been empirically studied. we analyzed 171 players’ accounts of either challenging or emotionally challenging experiences. players reported being emotionally challenged by confronting difficult themes, grappling with tough in-game decisions, and by having to keep in control of their own intense negative emotions. compared to more ‘conventional’ notions of challenge, emotional challenge evoked a wider range of negative emotions, but was nevertheless well received by most players. moreover, our findings suggest that several core aspects of conventional challenge do not readily apply to emotional challenge. taken together, our findings highlight the appeal of uncomfortable player experiences, and extend our understanding of (emotional) challenge in games.",40
Eyes-Free Target Acquisition in Interaction Space around the Body for Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656510,"eyes-free target acquisition is a basic and important human ability to interact with the surrounding physical world, relying on the sense of space and proprioception. in this research, we leverage this ability to improve interaction in virtual reality (vr), by allowing users to acquire a virtual object without looking at it. we expect this eyes-free approach can effectively reduce head movements and focus changes, so as to speed up the interaction and alleviate fatigue and vr sickness. we conduct three lab studies to progressively investigate the feasibility and usability of eyes-free target acquisition in vr. results show that, compared with the eyes-engaged manner, the eyes-free approach is significantly faster, provides satisfying accuracy, and introduces less fatigue and sickness; most participants (13/16) prefer this approach. we also measure the accuracy of motion control and evaluate subjective experience of users when acquiring targets at different locations around the body. based on the results, we make suggestions on designing appropriate target layout and discuss several design issues for eyes-free target acquisition in vr. in this paper, we studied eyes-free acquisition of targets in the interaction space around body for vr through three studies. in study 1 and study 2, we tested the subjective acceptance and control accuracy of the eyes-free acquisition. we explored the positions that users felt comfortable to acquire and the minimum distance between targets that they needed to acquire them with certainty. then we measured the offset from users’ acquisition point to the target when it was located at different positions and tested the influence of body rotations made on their control accuracy. in study 3, by comparing the eyesfree approach to the eyes-engaged approach, we showed that eyes-free target acquisition provided the benefits of faster speed, less fatigue and sickness, and less distraction from other ongoing tasks. while it might cause heavier mental demand and relatively lower accuracy (92.59% vs. 98.87% for 18 targets) as the trade-off. overall, most users (13/16) preferred eyes-free acquisition over eyes-engaged acquisition, especially when the fov was small or there was a second task. based on the results and user feedback, we make suggestions on layout design and design implications for real applications.",41
Change Blindness in Proximity-Aware Mobile Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656511,"interface designs on both small and large displays can encourage people to alter their physical distance to the display. mobile devices support this form of interaction naturally, as the user can move the device closer or further away as needed. the current generation of mobile devices can employ computer vision, depth sensing and other inference methods to determine the distance between the user and the display. once this distance is known, a system can adapt the rendering of display content accordingly and enable proximity-aware mobile interfaces. the dominant method of exploiting proximity-aware interfaces is to remove or superimpose visual information. in this paper, we investigate change blindness in such interfaces. we present the results of two experiments. in our first experiment we show that a proximity-aware mobile interface results in significantly more change blindness errors than a non-moving interface. the absolute difference in error rates was 13.7%. in our second experiment we show that within a proximity-aware mobile interface, gradual changes induce significantly more change blindness errors than instant changes---confirming expected change blindness behavior. based on our results we discuss the implications of either exploiting change blindness effects or mitigating them when designing mobile proximity-aware interfaces. in this paper we have presented the results of two studies. first, we have shown that proximity-aware interfaces induce more change blindness errors than non-moving interfaces. second, we replicated results from classic change blindness experiments in which it was found that gradual changes are harder to detect than instant changes. the highest error rates occurred for gradual change across small, medium and large updates. these are important findings as they relate both to mitigating and exploiting change blindness in new proximity-aware mobile interfaces. we suggest future work should not only be restricted to device motion, as in our experiment, but extended to user motion. such a future investigation could potentially give rise to a further useful design implication: if change blindness is as prevalent in user motion as it is with device motion, then ubiquitous large displays could exploit change blindness induced due to the user’s forward motion to hide irrelevant changes. our experimental results suggest that change blindness, and perhaps other perceptional phenomena such as inattentional blindness, merits further investigation from a human-computer interaction perspective for two reasons. first, to resolve problems where users fail to notice interface changes. second, to understand the design potential of creating unobtrusive and discreet interface changes that can help offload the cognitive burden of the user.",42
Rethinking Thinking Aloud: A Comparison of Three Think-Aloud Protocols,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656512,"this paper presents the results of a study that compared three think-aloud methods: concurrent think-aloud, retrospective think-aloud, and a hybrid method. the three methods were compared through an evaluation of a library website, which involved four points of comparison: task performance, participants' experiences, usability problems discovered, and the cost of employing the methods. the results revealed that the concurrent method outperformed both the retrospective and the hybrid methods in facilitating successful usability testing. it detected higher numbers of usability problems than the retrospective method, and produced output comparable to that of the hybrid method. the method received average to positive ratings from its users, and no reactivity was observed. lastly, this method required much less time on the evaluator's part than did the other two methods, which involved double the testing and analysis time. this paper has discussed the results of using the traditional think-aloud methods: the concurrent think-aloud method, the retrospective think-aloud method, and the hybrid method. these three methods were compared through an evaluation of a library website, which involved four points of comparison: overall task performance, test participants’ experiences, quantity and quality of usability problems discovered, and the cost of employing methods. overall, the findings revealed that the concurrent method can be argued to have outperformed the retrospective method and hybrid method in facilitating usability testing. it detected higher numbers of usability problems than the retrospective method, and produced output comparable to that of the hybrid method. the method received average to positive ratings from its users, and the possible reactivity associated with the concurrent think-aloud was not observed in this study, as no differences between participants' task success rates were found for this method compared to the silent condition in the retrospective test. in addition, this method required much less time on the evaluator’s part than the other two methods, which required double the testing and analysis time. these findings imply a basis for preferring the concurrent method over the retrospective and hybrid methods.",43
"Reading on Smart Glasses: The Effect of Text Position, Presentation Type and Walking",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656513,"smart glasses are increasingly being used in professional contexts. having key applications such as short messaging and newsreader, they enable continuous access to textual information. in particular, smart glasses allow reading while performing other activities as they do not occlude the user's world view. for efficient reading, it is necessary to understand how a text should be presented on them. we, therefore, conducted a study with 24 participants using a microsoft hololens to investigate how to display text on smart glasses while walking and sitting. we compared text presentation in the top-right, center, and bottom-center positions with rapid serial visual presentation (rsvp) and line-by-line scrolling. we found that text displayed in the top-right of smart glasses increases subjective workload and reduces comprehension. rsvp yields higher comprehension while sitting. conversely, reading with scrolling yields higher comprehension while walking. insights from our study inform the design of reading interfaces for smart glasses. we investigated three text positions (top-right, center, bottomcenter) and two presentation types (rsvp, line-by-line scrolling) on a binocular see-through smart glasses while walking and sitting. we studied how walking, text position, and presentation type affect comprehension, reading and walking speed, and workload. we supported our investigation with quantitative objective and subjective data, and qualitative feedback. we found that presenting text in the top-right of a smart glasses results a significantly lower text comprehension and higher workload with compared to the center and the bottom-center positions while both walking and sitting. rsvp results in higher comprehension while sitting and reading with scrolling results in higher comprehension while walking. furthermore, we found that mobility affects reading speed: reading while walking was slower than while sitting. the findings can be used as design recommendations for implementing reading-based applications on smart glasses. as in our study, we did not use secondary task while sitting or obstacles while walking, we suggest future work to investigate these effects on reading on smart glasses. as we did our study in an indoor environment, we plan to carry out of these studies in outdoor settings.",44
Mini-Me: An Adaptive Avatar for Mixed Reality Remote Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656514,"we present mini-me, an adaptive avatar for enhancing mixed reality (mr) remote collaboration between a local augmented reality (ar) user and a remote virtual reality (vr) user. the mini-me avatar represents the vr user's gaze direction and body gestures while it transforms in size and orientation to stay within the ar user's field of view. a user study was conducted to evaluate mini-me in two collaborative scenarios: an asymmetric remote expert in vr assisting a local worker in ar, and a symmetric collaboration in urban planning. we found that the presence of the mini-me significantly improved social presence and the overall experience of mr collaboration. in this paper, we presented our concept, design, and implementation of the mini-me, a novel adaptive avatar with redirected gaze and gestures for enhancing remote mr collaboration. we evaluated the impact of the mini-me on social presence, task difficulty, and mental effort for two collaborative scenarios. and we discussed the implications of the mini-me for mr collaborative interface design. overall, we found that the mini-me avatar was able to convey the non-verbal communication cues necessary to improve the performance on an asymmetric object placement task. it was also useful for improving social presence in both asymmetric and symmetric tasks. in both cases users overwhelmingly preferred having the mini-me avatar. this supports our belief that adding the adaptive mini-me avatar could improve the user’s awareness of their partner in a collaborative mr interface between ar and vr. for our future work, we would like to improve the minime’s adaptive surface projection technique. we are considering applying an automatic alignment technique, such as snaptoreality [30] that automatically aligns virtual objects to physical constraints calculated from the real world in real-time. a similar feature is also available as part of the microsoft mr platform called “spatial understanding” [28], which we plan to use in our next iteration. we also would like to improve the empathy of the remote collaboration by recognizing and mapping facial expression of the vr/ar user onto the avatar [26]. we plan to conduct a follow up study for more complex tasks.",45
Viewer Experience of Obscuring Scene Elements in Photos to Enhance Privacy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656525,"with the rise of digital photography and social networking, people are sharing personal photos online at an unprecedented rate. in addition to their main subject matter, photographs often capture various incidental information that could harm people's privacy. while blurring and other image filters may help obscure private content, they also often affect the utility and aesthetics of the photos, which is important since images shared in social media are mainly for human consumption. existing studies of privacy-enhancing image filters either primarily focus on obscuring faces, or do not systematically study how filters affect image utility. to understand the trade-offs when obscuring various sensitive aspects of images, we study eleven filters applied to obfuscate twenty different objects and attributes, and evaluate how effectively they protect privacy and preserve image quality for human viewers. our work sheds light on the effects of applying various types of image transforms to scene elements in an image. in particular we studied the relative trade-offs between privacy (revealing and concealing selective attributes of objects) and utility (the visual aesthetics and user satisfaction of the image) of five different image transforms and show that while in some cases a clear privacy vs. utility trade-off is realized, in other scenarios a high degree of privacy can be attained while retaining utility. our work also contributes significantly to the existing literature by examining these trade-offs for a range of objects and their attributes, whereas previous work had focused largely on obscuring people and faces. we hope our work spurs further research on studying the relative trade-offs of image transformations for enhanced privacy without (significantly) degrading the user experience of the viewers.",46
Navigating the Job Search as a Low-Resourced Job Seeker,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656526,"the internet is providing increasing access to information about employment opportunities, but not everyone can leverage it effectively. research suggests that job seekers with limited access to internet technologies are being left behind, while those with limited social resources are expected to rely on the internet even more. in this work, we conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 11 low-resourced job seekers in a metropolitan area in the midwestern usa to understand how social and digital resources support their efforts to find work. we find that online resources support job seekers in finding relevant jobs via search, but do not help them identify opportunities to improve their job search process or increase their chances of securing employment. we recommend that systems aiming to support low-resourced job seekers design for deeper engagement with their users across the job search process, to help users recognize ways to improve on their existing practices. in this work, we examine the roles of important information resources in the job search process of low-resourced job seekers through semi-structured interviews. we find that, while personal social connections remain vital for the majority of job seekers, online employment search platforms and personal social media sites enhance job seekers’ existing practices and afford innovative forms of job seeking. however, these online resources do not help job seekers identify problems in their job search or overcome structural barriers. to empower job seekers experiencing these issues, we call for employment platforms to engage with their users by conceiving of the job search as an extended, goal-oriented process. to achieve this, we propose designs recommendations that support access to trustworthy information about jobs and employers, prompt reflection about activities throughout the job search, and identify valuable opportunities to leverage social relationships in both the job search and in long-term career development.",47
The Value of Empty Space for Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656527,"we present a study on a group of people who, upon adopting a new lifestyle movement, have discovered and constructed alternative aspects of space. drawing on 23 interviews with minimalists and participant observations of their meetup meetings, we highlight the central role of empty space in their lives at home. our findings show how empty space for minimalists emerge as a new, hitherto unknown space in the home and the ways minimalists seek to create, maintain, and stay sensitive to these empty spaces. empty spaces for minimalists signify their achievements, exudes aesthetic appeal, and provide a sanctuary away from city life. we propose new opportunities for design based on our findings of empty space. we suggest that design should consider supporting the practices and values that revolve around the absence of artifacts. in this paper, we have described the value of designing for empty space. by focusing on minimalists, we were able to gain close insight on what it means to treat empty space as a first class object, one that deserves respect and represents— both visibly and invisibly—the new values our informants have adopted. while our findings draw from our ethnographic work on minimalists, we believe their practices and values can inform designers concerned with technologies for any sort of space that has long-term engagement. for example, the workplace, second homes, and third places (e.g., libraries, cafes) are all locales we regular interact with and, moreover, contain “other” spaces—spaces we regularly overlook. spaces like dusty corners, closets, and storage boxes can be considered other spaces. attuning ourselves to empty space suggests that we scrutinize the relationship between object and empty space, the ways we process empty space, and how we appreciate and interact directly with empty space. future work should investigate how technologies can support these three focal points of empty space. for instance, while previous designs have examined gazing at spaces, these studies have the end-goal of designing new technologies to be placed in these spaces. instead, we ask whether we can study the ways in which we interact with (e.g,. gaze upon) space for the sake of designing technologies that support empty space rather than inserting and thus destroying the very qualities of empty space that people enjoy. such technologies show promise to give the same aesthetic, mental, and spiritual benefits that so transformed our minimalists’ perspectives on space.",48
Disorder or Driver?: The Effects of Nomophobia on Work-Related Outcomes in Organizations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656528,"nomophobia, which refers to discomfort or anxiety caused by being unable to use one's smartphone, has become prevalent among smartphone users. however, the influence of nomophobia on employees' work-related outcomes remains unclear. drawing on the job demands-resources theory, this study develops a model that explores the interplay between employees' nomophobia, work engagement, emotional exhaustion, work interruption, and job productivity. the proposed model was tested using data collected from 187 employees in one organization. the results demonstrate that some employees with high levels of nomophobia feel more engaged with their work and more productive, yet others tend to be emotionally exhausted and feel they are less productive. by illuminating the dual effects of nomophobia on employees' work-related outcomes, this study extends our understanding of how smartphone use positively and negatively affects employees in the workplace. the notion of nomophobia in the workplace is discussed, along with new directions for research. this research extends the existing literature by proposing the dual effects of nomophobia on work-related outcomes. previous research has shown that employee productivity can be positively predicted by work engagement and negatively predicted by emotional exhaustion. by investigating how nomophobia influences work engagement and emotional exhaustion, our work expands on the studies regarding technology use and employee productivity. we conclude from our empirical test of the model we developed, that although nomophobia can induce work engagement, it also can increase emotional exhaustion, thereby adversely affecting job productivity. hence, organizations need to pay attention to the paradoxical mechanisms related to employees’ nomophobia. we hope that our findings will assist researchers and managers in understanding the phenomenon of nomophobia in the workplace.",49
"My Telepresence, My Culture?: An Intercultural Investigation of Telepresence Robot Operators' Interpersonal Distance Behaviors",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656529,"interpersonal distance behaviors can vary significantly across countries and impact human social interaction. do these cross-cultural differences play out when one of the interaction partners participates through a teleoperated robot? emerging research shows that when being approached by a robot, people tend to hold similar cultural preferences as they would for an approaching human. however, no work yet has investigated this question from a robot teleoperator's perspective. toward answering this, we conducted an online study (n = 774) using a novel simulation paradigm across two countries (u.s. and india). results show that in the role of a telepresence robot operator, participants exhibited cross-cultural differences in interpersonal distance behavior in line with human-human proxemic research, indicating that culture-specific distance behavior can manifest in the way a robot operator controls a robot. we discuss implications for designers who seek to automate path planning and navigation for teleoperated robots. in an increasingly technological and global world, one may find oneself interacting with a coworker from another country through a company’s telepresence robot. what do we need to be aware of in these situations, and how should we design the next level technology to support the social and emotional functioning of those involved? the present study provided initial evidence that a robot teleoperator’s culture-specific behaviors can be transmitted to the intermediary robot through the operator’s actions on the control interface, at least in terms of interpersonal distance behaviors. we also presented a new robot teleoperation simulation paradigm that can facilitate chi 2018 paper chi 2018, april 21–26, 2018, montréal, qc, canada paper 51 page 8 future online investigations of remote robot operators’ perspectives and behaviors. finally, our results offer an important design insight for the future development of robot teleoperation that takes into consideration culture-specific behaviors of the robot teleoperator.",50
"Privacy Lies: Understanding How, When, and Why People Lie to Protect Their Privacy in Multiple Online Contexts",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656520,"in this paper, we study online privacy lies: lies primarily aimed at protecting privacy. going beyond privacy lenses that focus on privacy concerns or cost/benefit analyses, we explore how contextual factors, motivations, and individual-level characteristics affect lying behavior through a 356-person survey. we find that statistical models to predict privacy lies that include attitudes about lying, use of other privacy-protective behaviors (ppbs), and perceived control over information improve on models based solely on self-expressed privacy concerns. based on a thematic analysis of open-ended responses, we find that the decision to tell privacy lies stems from a range of concerns, serves multiple privacy goals, and is influenced by the context of the interaction and attitudes about the morality and necessity of lying. together, our results point to the need for conceptualizations of privacy lies-and ppbs more broadly-that account for multiple goals, perceived control over data, contextual factors, and attitudes about ppbs. in this study, we put forth an improved model to predict privacy lies that incorporates actual privacy-protective behaviors, perceived control over data, and attitudes about lying in addition to commonly used scales of privacy-related concerns. we then identified how contextual factors influence privacy lies during interactions with people and with systems, such as perceptions of the request and requestor. finally, we characterized the different types of privacy lies, the functions they serve, and the reasons people have for telling or abstaining from privacy lies in multiple contexts. overall, our findings highlight the need to examine a range of contextual factors and motivations, beyond general privacy concerns, in understanding privacy lies as well as privacy-protective behaviors more generally.",51
"""We Are the Product"": Public Reactions to Online Data Sharing and Privacy Controversies in the Media",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656521,"as online platforms increasingly collect large amounts of data about their users, there has been growing public concern about privacy around issues such as data sharing. controversies around practices perceived as surprising or even unethical often highlight patterns of privacy attitudes when they spark conversation in the media. this paper examines public reaction ""in the wild"" to two data sharing controversies that were the focus of media attention-regarding the social media and communication services facebook and whatsapp, as well as the email service unroll.me. these controversies instigated discussion of data privacy and ethics, accessibility of website policies, notions of responsibility for privacy, cost-benefit analyses, and strategies for privacy management such as non-use. an analysis of reactions and interactions captured by comments on news articles not only reveals information about pervasive privacy attitudes, but also suggests communication and design strategies that could benefit both platforms and users. our analysis of “in the wild” reactions to perceived data sharing and privacy violations supports concepts from prior work around issues such as responsibility [10,24], costbenefit analyses [33,39], the role of privacy policies [6,14,44], non-use as a strategy [39,4,38] trust for platforms [18,47], and expectation violations [31]. because we were examining concrete reactions, our data has strong ecological validity but often lacks information about motivation or user characteristics. there is a strong case for further qualitative work to validate these user attitudes (beyond comparisons to prior work) based on the rich information we have now about specific reactions. there is also potential for future work in conducting studies with commenters on news articles in order to tease out exactly how media portrayals impact their attitudes. additionally, in discussing the trade-offs of potential solutions, we put forth increased transparency about the why of privacy practices (in conjunction with increased accessibility of that information) as a solution that could work particularly well in the context of perceived privacy violations around data sharing. additional next steps would be to study users’ reactions to this proposal, as well as to find out more about their information needs, and to conduct usability studies around the best display mode for this information. our findings also point to the importance of understanding user expectations when it comes to privacy; whether most users agree that it’s okay to be the product or not, shaping expectations with more transparency could help reduce the frequency of these kinds of privacy controversies.",52
FaceDisplay: Towards Asymmetric Multi-User Interaction for Nomadic Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656522,"mobile vr hmds enable scenarios where they are being used in public, excluding all the people in the surrounding (non-hmd users) and reducing them to be sole bystanders. we present facedisplay, a modified vr hmd consisting of three touch sensitive displays and a depth camera attached to its back. people in the surrounding can perceive the virtual world through the displays and interact with the hmd user via touch or gestures. to further explore the design space of facedisplay, we implemented three applications (fruitslicer, spaceface and conductor) each presenting different sets of aspects of the asymmetric co-located interaction (e.g. gestures vs touch). we conducted an exploratory user study (n=16), observing pairs of people experiencing two of the applications and showing a high level of enjoyment and social interaction with and without an hmd. based on the findings we derive design considerations for asymmetric co-located vr applications and argue that vr hmds are currently designed having only the hmd user in mind but should also include non-hmd users. in this work, we presented the design and implementation of facedisplay, a mobile vr hmd prototype consisting of three touch sensitive displays and a depth camera attached to its back. facedisplay enables people in the surrounding to perceive the virtual world through the displays and interact with the hmd user via touch or gestures. we presented three applications (fruitslicer, spaceface and conductor), each focusing on one specific aspect of the asymmetric co-located interaction. we further conducted an exploratory user study (n=16), observing pairs of people experiencing two of the applications. our results showed that facedisplay was able to let the non-hmd user perceive and interact with the hmd user but resulted also in a high level of dominance and responsibility of the non-hmd user over the hmd user. we argue that vr hmds are currently designed having only the hmd user in mind but should also include all the people in the environment to break out of the current isolation an hmd user experiences when using vr hmds.",53
Interactive Guidance Techniques for Improving Creative Feedback,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656523,"good feedback is critical to creativity and learning, yet rare. many people do not know how to actually provide effective feedback. there is increasing demand for quality feedback -- and thus feedback givers -- in learning and professional settings. this paper contributes empirical evidence that two interactive techniques -- reusable suggestions and adaptive guidance -- can improve feedback on creative work. we present these techniques embodied in the critiquekit system to help reviewers give specific, actionable, and justified feedback. two real-world deployment studies and two controlled experiments with critiquekit found that adaptively-presented suggestions improve the quality of feedback from novice reviewers. reviewers also reported that suggestions and guidance helped them describe their thoughts and reminded them to provide effective feedback. looking across the deployments and experiments, adaptive suggestions and interactive guidance significantly improved feedback while static suggestions did not offer significant improvements. these techniques were embodied in the critiquekit system, used by 95 feedback providers and 336 recipients. future work should examine applying other attributes of helpful feedback and further investigate how best to create, curate, and display adaptive suggestions. much knowledge work features both underlying principles and context-specific knowledge of when and how to apply these principles. potentially applicable feedback and review areas include domains as disparate as hiring and employee reviews, code reviews, product reviews, and reviews of academic papers, screenplays, business plans, and any other domain that blends context-specific creative choices with common genre structures. we hope that creativity support tools of all stripes will find value in the ideas and results presented here.",54
Environmental Factors in Indoor Navigation Based on Real-World Trajectories of Blind Users,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656524,"indoor localization technologies can enhance quality of life for blind people by enabling them to independently explore and navigate indoor environments. researchers typically evaluate their systems in terms of localization accuracy and user behavior along planned routes. we propose two measures of path-following behavior: deviation from optimal route and trajectory variability. through regression analysis of real-world trajectories from blind users, we identify relationships between a) these measures and b) elements of the environment, route characteristics, localization error, and instructional cues that users receive. our results provide insights into path-following behavior for turn-by-turn indoor navigation and have implications for the design of future interactions. moreover, our findings highlight the importance of reporting these environmental factors and route properties in similar studies. we present automated and scalable methods for their calculation and to encourage their reporting for better interpretation and comparison of results across future studies. this paper presents an analysis of factors contributing to trajectory variability and deviation in assistive indoor navigation for blind people. we provide evidence that characteristics of the physical environment affect successful navigation, in addition to generally acknowledged variables such as localization error of the system and instructional cues that users receive. for example, we show that users tend to adhere more to a path where scene and layout elements such stairs and pillars are not present (likely due to varying acoustic properties of the path). moreover, we show that factors contributing to pathfollowing behavior calculated over noisy location estimates are well-aligned with factors revealed by annotated, groundtruth location data. given the challenges in annotating blind users trajectories with sub-meter accuracy, we provide a scalable solution for data-driven analysis and evaluation within the field. our findings highlight the importance of including and reporting these environmental factors in future studies. in future work, we plan to replicate this analysis with larger datasets from estimated trajectories of blind users across multiple environments. a larger dataset would also allow us to investigate how dynamic scene elements, e.g., presence of people, affect the performance of indoor navigation systems for blind users.",55
BSpeak: An Accessible Voice-based Crowdsourcing Marketplace for Low-Income Blind People,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656535,"bspeak is an accessible crowdsourcing marketplace that enables blind people in developing regions to earn money by transcribing audio files through speech. we examine accessibility and usability barriers that 15 first-time users, who are low-income and blind, experienced while completing transcription tasks on bspeak and mechanical turk (mturk). our mixed-methods analysis revealed severe accessibility barriers in mturk due to the absence of landmarks, unlabeled ui elements, and improper use of html headings. compared to mturk, participants found bspeak significantly more accessible and usable, and completed tasks with higher accuracy in lesser time due to its voice-based implementation. in a two-week field deployment of bspeak in india, 24 low-income blind users earned rupee 7,310 by completing over 16,000 transcription tasks to yield transcriptions with 87% accuracy. through our analysis of bspeak's strengths and weaknesses, we provide recommendations for designing crowdsourcing marketplaces for low-income blind people in resource-constrained settings. we recommend designers of mainstream crowdsourcing marketplaces to incorporate comprehensible terminologies, design user interfaces within accessibility guidelines, and add a filter to select accessible tasks. we recommend task requesters to provide simple and clear instructions, design accessible content on external webpages, and indicate upfront if a task is inaccessible for blind people. bspeak demonstrated that a simple user interface, use of voice input, and untimed tasks could make a crowdsourcing marketplace more accessible for low-income blind people in resource-constrained settings.",56
Understanding Chatbot-mediated Task Management,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656536,"effective task management is essential to successful team collaboration. while the past decade has seen considerable innovation in systems that track and manage group tasks, these innovations have typically been outside of the principal communication channels: email, instant messenger, and group chat. teams formulate, discuss, refine, assign, and track the progress of their collaborative tasks over electronic communication channels, yet they must leave these channels to update their task-tracking tools, creating a source of friction and inefficiency. to address this problem, we explore how bots might be used to mediate task management for individuals and teams. we deploy a prototype bot to eight different teams of information workers to help them create, assign, and keep track of tasks, all within their main communication channel. we derived seven insights for the design of future bots for coordinating work. in this paper we introduce taskbot, a bot designed to help teams manage their tasks. users delegate the tracking of their chi 2018 paper chi 2018, april 21–26, 2018, montréal, qc, canada paper 58 page 4 tasks to taskbot. we described our approach to designing taskbot, and shared the lessons that we learned from deploying it with eight teams. we focused on identifying design considerations for other bot designers building conversational user interfaces for workplace. as for taskbot, future work will focus on the following features: exploring the use of multiple communication channels (e.g. email, skype, etc.), better handling of multi-threaded conversations, and more sophisticated ways of assigning tasks to people based on the task description.",57
Rich Representations of Visual Content for Screen Reader Users,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656537,"alt text (short for ""alternative text"") is descriptive text associated with an image in html and other document formats. screen reader technologies speak the alt text aloud to people who are visually impaired. introduced with html 2.0 in 1995, the alt attribute has not evolved despite significant changes in technology over the past two decades. in light of the expanding volume, purpose, and importance of digital imagery, we reflect on how alt text could be supplemented to offer a richer experience of visual content to screen reader users. our contributions include articulating the design space of representations of visual content for screen reader users, prototypes illustrating several points within this design space, and evaluations of several of these new image representations with people who are blind. we close by discussing the implications of our taxonomy, prototypes, and user study findings. in this paper, we argued that the status quo experience of alt text, a standard that is more than two decades old, does not take advantage of the capabilities of modern computing technologies that could be used to provide a rich, immersive, and evocative experience of digital imagery for people who are blind. we articulated a taxonomy comprising five categories (interactivity, stability, representation, structure, and personalization) that can be used to create richer representations of visual content for screen reader users. we then introduced prototypes demonstrating six new experiences that supplement or transform standard alt text by combining different properties of this new design space. finally, we presented detailed feedback on three of these novel “alt text” interactions from fourteen screen reader users.",58
"Let's Hate Together: How People Share News in Messaging, Social, and Public Networks",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656538,"there are currently a wide variety of ways to share news with others: from sharing in a personal message, to sharing on a social network, to publicly posting. through a survey with over one thousand people and an artifact analysis of 262 shared articles, we examine differences in motivations and frequency of sharing news on public, social and private platforms. we find that public sharing is more focused on spreading an ideology, while private sharing in messaging is dominated by stories inspired by the recipient's interests or context. the survey revealed three main groups of news sharing practices: those who shared to all channels (public, social, private), those who didn't share at all, and those who shared to private and social. the groups differed in their attitudes toward online discussion; those that shared the most were neutral and those that didn't share had negative attitudes about discussion online. we discuss sharing practices and implications for social systems that support sharing news. in this paper, we presented what we believe to be the first comprehensive look at news sharing behaviors across messaging apps, social media, and public platforms using an analysis of actual artifacts of sharing and a survey. by recruiting a broad sample of online participants from across the us, we were able to explore how a variety of online americans share and don’t share news, digitally. our research addressed differences in attitudes and motivations to share across different audiences and the different types and amounts of stories that were shared. fewer people share news publicly, and on average they share less frequently than through social and private messaging. those who share publicly have more faith in online discourse and are moderately worried about online conflict and those who never share are pessimistic about online discourse and less worried about conflict. public shares have different news content: more political ideology and less information sharing. while we intended to study general sharing during a typical news cycle, data was collected and analyzed in an unprecedented high-intensity election year. it might be argued that our results are evidence that after the american election there continues to be heightened after-effects. we encourage other researchers to continue this work by conducting similar studies outside of the united states and over longer time periods in order to investigate regional or temporal differences in sharing and discussing the news. whether done publicly or toward friends and family, we found that people use news to voice their values and ideology, especially when they believe others will listen and learn from it. people who only share with friends and family are more concerned about pitfalls of online discussion, and share information relevant to their relationships. by studying how people share news, and differences between sharing to different audiences through different platforms, we are understanding how people engage with this type of technology. sharing links is an important part of the diffusion of news and these emotional, behavioral and technological mechanisms are believed to play a key part in swaying the 2016 us election [16]. this work aids researchers and designers to create systems that better support the sharing of news across a variety of platforms as well as engaging users to comment on news with the audiences that they choose.",59
Reinterpreting Schlemmer's Triadic Ballet: Interactive Costume for Unthinkable Movements,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656539,"in the 1920s, oskar schlemmer, artist in the bauhaus movement, created the triadic ballet costumes. these re-strict movement of dancers, creating new expressions. in-spired by this, we designed an interactive wire costume. it restricts lower body movements, and emphasizes arm movements spurring led-light 'sparks' and 'waves' wired in a tutu-like costume. the wire costume was introduced to a dancer who found that an unusual bond emerged be-tween her and the costume. we discuss how sensory altera-tion (sight, kinesthetic awareness and proprioception) and bodily training to adjust to the new soma, can result in nov-el, evocative forms of expression. the interactive costume can foster a certain mood, introduce feelings, and even embody a whole character -- only revealed once worn and danced. we describe a design exploration combining cul-tural and historical research, interviews with experts and material explorations that culminated in a novel prototype. sensory alteration appears to be crucial for novel forms of dancer’s expression. obstruction of vision, metamorphosis of body shape and weight distribution, restriction of movements and means of expression opens a dancer for the new experience. traditional ways of moving, expressing, communicating are disabled or made too complex to perform, providing a dancer and choreographer with a “tabula rasa”, a starting point to experiment with new forms of movement and expression, having an opportunity to create something new, which has not been performed before. at the same time, the restrictions literally “put” the dancer inside of the body of the character, telling its story, temperament, behavior kinesthetically, which is one of the most powerful catalysts of immersion. by affecting kinesthetic awareness and proprioception of the dancers, the costumes contribute to which movements are possible and desirable, therefore having an active role in the construction of the choreography. our work provides the first empirical investigation into the effect of the triadic ballett’s costumes on dancer’s experience of movement, perception and embodied awareness. furthermore, based on the gained understanding of the costumes’ ‘essence’ for experience, we developed a reinterpretation using interactive technology and tested this. our modernized version manages to preserve the aesthetics of the original costume and, even more important, the experience inside it. in addition, the interactivity of the costume adds another degree of freedom in the dialog between the dancer and the costume. while the costume alters the soma of the dancer, the dancer is affecting back, by controlling the lighting effects of the costume. we believe that the hci community can find inspiration from this ‘extreme case study’ of wearables and costumes, which highlights the costumes impact on bodily awareness and movement and shows how design choices (restrictions and limitations on movement) that could be discounted as ‘bad usability’ can be functional and might inspire new uses for wearables.",60
Exploring the Potential of Exergames to affect the Social and Daily Life of People with Dementia and their Caregivers,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656530,"this paper presents the outcomes of an exploratory field study that examined the social impact of an ict-based suite of exergames for people with dementia and their caregivers. qualitative data was collected over a period of 8 months, during which time we studied the daily life of 14 people with dementia and their informal and professional caregivers. we focus on the experiential aspects of the system and examine its social impact when integrated into the daily routines of both people with dementia themselves and their professional and family caregivers. our findings indicate that relatives were able to regain leisure time, whilst people with dementia were able to recapture certain aspects of their social and daily activities that might otherwise have been lost to them. results suggest that the system enhanced social-interaction, invigorated relationships, and improved the empowerment of people with dementia and their caregivers to face daily challenges. the results from the study have illustrated that serious exergames are able to support the self-confidence and wellbeing of relevant stakeholders and enable people with dementia to face the challenges of a self-determined and dignified aging with dementia. with respect to the individual and social impacts of the system, it seemed to re-facilitate certain aspects of an autonomous lifestyle, such as the mobility related activities of daily living, respectively promoting them and maintaining independence as well as offsetting deficits. the results also suggest that the system enhanced social interaction and invigorated relationships, improving empowerment to face the daily challenges of people with dementia in their social surrounding. it thus seemed to improve the quality of life and well-being of people with dementia and their relatives. for professional caregivers in day-care settings, the study suggested that implementing such ict-based systems might support workflows and thus improve institutionalized quality of care. much still needs to be done to build a wider corpus of empirical findings regarding how people with dementia can be supported by the use of these kinds of systems. we also need to further understand the most effective mechanisms for ensuring that this kind of support can be fully integrated into the everyday lives of people with dementia. the aim of this exploratory study was to investigate the integration of a suite of ict-based exergames into the daily routines of people with dementia and their informal and professional caregivers and to explore the social impacts and benefits of the system over a lengthy period of 8-months. a key feature here was the way in which the system was codesigned with relatives, professional caregivers and other stakeholders from related disciplines and the public sector. this process of open collaboration enabled us to reflect different kinds of knowledge, interests, and aspirations so that a mutually tailored and appropriate technical solution could be arrived at.",61
Grafter: Remixing 3D-Printed Machines,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656531,"creating new 3d printed objects by recombining models found in hobbyist repositories has been referred to as ""re-mixing"". in this paper, we explore how to best support users in remixing a specific class of 3d printed objects, namely those that perform mechanical functions. in our survey, we found that makers remix such machines by manually extracting parts from one parent model and combine it with parts from a different parent model. this approach often puts axles made by one maker into bearings made by another maker or combines a gear by one maker with a gear by a different maker. this approach is problem-atic, however, as parts from different makers tend to fit poorly, which results in long series of tweaks and test-prints until all parts finally work together. we address this with our interactive system grafter. grafter does two things. first, grafter largely automates the process of extracting and recombining mechanical elements from 3d printed machines. second, it enforces a more efficient approach to reuse: it prevents users from extracting indi-vidual parts, but instead affords extracting groups of me-chanical elements that already work together, such as axles and their bearings or pairs of gears. we call this mecha-nism-based remixing. in a final user study, all models that participants had remixed using grafter could be 3d printed without further tweaking and worked immediately. in this paper, we presented grafter, a tool that allows users to remix 3d printed mechanical machines. in addition to the system itself, our main contribution is that grafter does not follow common maker practice of extracting and re-assembling parts. instead, grafter extracts self-contained mechanical units, aka mechanisms that remain functional throughout remixing. the main benefit for users is that grafter eliminates the need for tweaking and test printing. as future work, we plan on using the model graphs to make machine designs work across different printers and materials.",62
Depth Conflict Reduction for Stereo VR Video Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656532,"applications for viewing and editing 360° video often render user interface (ui) elements on top of the video. for stereoscopic video, in which the perceived depth varies over the image, the perceived depth of the video can conflict with that of the ui elements, creating discomfort and making it hard to shift focus. to address this problem, we explore two new techniques that adjust the ui rendering based on the video content. the first technique dynamically adjusts the perceived depth of the ui to avoid depth conflict, and the second blurs the video in a halo around the ui. we conduct a user study to assess the effectiveness of these techniques in two stereoscopic vr video tasks: video watching with subtitles, and video search. we explore depth conflicts between ui and stereoscopic video and discuss how they can affect user experience in vr video interfaces. we present two techniques to address this problem. dynamic depth detects and reduces depth conflicts by analyzing the video content and adjusting the depth of ui widgets to the depth of the video. halo blur simply blurs the video around the ui. we evaluated these techniques in a preliminary user study with two video tasks: watching video with subtitles and video searching. our study compares our techniques with a baseline condition where the ui is fixed at a comfortable distance in vr. our results suggest that the severity of depth conflict problems might depend on the task characteristics and the ui design. it also shows that dynamic depth is a promising solution and was most preferred by our participants for video subtitles. our results also show that halo blur did not work as expected in a dynamic vr video environment.",63
"From Pulse Trains to ""Coloring with Vibrations"": Motion Mappings for Mid-Air Haptic Textures",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656533,"can we experience haptic textures in mid-air? typically, the experience of texture is caused by vibration of the fingertip as it moves over the surface of an object. this object's surface also guides the finger's movement, creating an implicit motion-to-vibration mapping. if we wish to simulate a texture in mid-air, such guidance does not exist, making the choice of motion-to-vibration mapping non-obvious. we evaluate the experience of moving a pointer with four different motion-to vibration mappings in an interview study. we found that some mappings lead to a perception shift, transforming the experience. when this occurs, the pointer is no longer perceived as vibrating, interactions become more pleasurable, and users have an increased experience of agency and control. we discuss how to leverage this in the design of haptic interfaces. so, can we experience haptic textures in mid-air? we found that, based on mapping, experiences very similar to texture can be created. if an object just vibrates without reacting to movement, it is experienced as a device, such as a toothbrush or vibrating smartphone. if an object vibrates based on where it is pointed, it feels more useful, but still like a device – maybe a geiger counter or metal detector. in our rotation and translation condition, however, the way the vibrations were experienced transformed, leading to a material experience related to texture. these textures are more pleasing than ‘traditional’ vibration and make moving a device more interesting – as if it had higher material quality. systems using mid-air textures can provide users with a stronger experience of agency and a better sense of control when interacting with them.",64
Collaborative Dynamic Queries: Supporting Distributed Small Group Decision-making,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656534,"communication is critical in small group decision-making processes during which each member must be able to express preferences to reach consensus. finding consensus can be difficult when each member in a group has a perspective that potentially conflicts with those of others. to support groups attempting to harmonize diverse preferences, we propose collaborative dynamic queries (c-dq), a ui component that enables a group to filter queries over decision criteria while being aware of others' preferences. to understand how c-dq affects a group's behavior and perception in the decision-making process, we conducted 2 studies with groups who were prompted to make decisions together on mobile devices in a dispersed and synchronous situation. in study 1, we found showing group preferences with c-dq helped groups to communicate more efficiently and effectively. in study 2, we found filtering candidates based on each member's own filter range further improved a groups' communication efficiency and effectiveness. we examined the role for c-dq to function as a moderator in small group decision-making and found initial evidence that visually externalized group awareness can support a group in making an agreeable and satisfactory decision with reduced cost for communication. we also identified that the way in which the system handles each member’s filter ranges may incur some different effects in different use context. we anticipate that our work sets up the possibility for a deeper understanding of different designs (e.g., group awareness visualization strategies that can consider better privacy, easier persuasion, or indicating different degree of importance each criterion) for c-dq that may work in various situations (e.g., different use context, different platforms, different size of a group).",65
Crowdsourcing Rural Network Maintenance and Repair via Network Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656545,"repair and maintenance requirements limit the successful operation of rural infrastructure. current best practices are centralized management, which requires travel from urban areas and is prohibitively expensive, or intensively training community members, which limits scaling. we explore an alternative model: crowdsourcing repair from the community. leveraging a community cellular network in the remote philippines, we sent sms to all active network subscribers (n = 63) requesting technical support. from the pool of physical respondents, we explored their ability to repair through mock failures and conducted semi-structured interviews about their experiences with repair. we learned that community members would be eager to practice repair if allowed, would network to recruit more expertise, and seemingly have the collective capacity to resolve some common failures. they are most successful when repairs map directly to their lived experiences. we suggest infrastructure design considerations that could make repairs more tractable and argue for an inclusive approach. in this work we explored the idea of “crowdsourcing” repair knowledge and ability for cell network repair from the local community using sms messages. working with a rural community in san andres, rizal, philippines, we sent all active network subscribers (n = 63) an sms asking them to come to the cell site to help fix a technical issue. 24 of these community members responded, of whom 18 were women. we then asked those who came to try to resolve three mock equipment failures. we found that nearly all were able to solve a simple solar panel issue, many had some capability to solve an antenna alignment issue, and only a few were able to correctly address an overheating cpu. exploring further, we found that the biggest barriers to local repair were concerns about authority or liability. we believe that these results demonstrate a large latent capacity for local repair in rural areas, especially for equipment similar to consumer electronics used at home.",66
Interactive Interior and Proxemics Thresholds: Empowering Participants in Sensitive Conversations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656546,"the position and workings of interactive interior elements matter greatly on the relations people may enact. this paper reports on the conception and evaluation of an interactive table and its interior effects designed to support sensitive consultations between healthcare personnel, patients and relatives as they happen during treatment of cancer diseases in a hospital department of oncology. the interior design includes the physical shape of artefact, its digital functionality and how the seating around it is to take place. the design of the table is substantiated through observations of current practice, framing of the design challenge, conceptualization, and exploring form giving alternatives. through a set of evaluations in actual use settings it is argued how the design concept of the table as interactive interior points to how notions in interaction proxemics should be rearticulated. in particular, this paper argues how proxemics thresholds should be regarded as dynamic and relational. in this paper, we presented a design intervention comprised of a prototype interactive table and its seating arrangement serving as an interior design element regulating the way sensitive consultations in an oncology department are carried out. the interactive table serves as control and structuring mechanism for both the conversation and the audio recording of it. the prototype has been designed in a research-through-design/ constructive design research process where field studies, user workshops and theoretical concepts from interaction proxemics have informed the design. a set of use trials in-the-wild revealed that when used according to design intentions the design intervention resulted in successful consultation, and when misused, patients were left frustrated and pacified. the analysis of the use trials pointed to notion that proxemics thresholds as identified by krogh et al.

What's at Stake: Characterizing Risk Perceptions of Emerging Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656548,"one contributing factor to how people choose to use technology is their perceptions of associated risk. in order to explore this influence, we adapted a survey instrument from risk perception literature to assess mental models of users and technologists around risks of emerging, data-driven technologies (e.g., identity theft, personalized filter bubbles). we surveyed 175 individuals for comparative and individual assessments of risk, including characterizations using psychological factors. we report our observations around group differences (e.g., expert versus non-expert) in how people assess risk, and what factors may structure their conceptions of technological harm. our findings suggest that technologists see these risks as posing a bigger threat to society than do non-experts. moreover, across groups, participants did not see technological risks as voluntarily assumed. differences in how people characterize risk have implications for the future of design, decision-making, and public communications, which we discuss through a lens we call risk-sensitive design. the above study applied an instrument from the risk perception literature to analyze thinking about emerging technologies. we found that generally users do not think of risk exposure from technology to be voluntary. there were also considerable differences in how risk is perceived by experts and the lay public, which may explain why problems such as the filter bubble, have become so concerning. our paper ends with a discussion of risk sensitive design, hoping to provoke continued conversation about how technologists should respond when there are large gaps in how the public and experts think about risk. we hope to see hci researchers continue study in this area and advance the conversation further.",69

Making Problems in Design Research: The Case of Teen Shoplifters on Tumblr,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656540,"hci draws on a variety of traditions but recently there have been calls to consolidate contributions around the problems researchers set out to solve. however, with this comes the assumption that problems are tractable and certain, rather than constructed and framed by researchers. we take as a case study a tumblr community of teen shoplifters who post on how to steal from stores, discuss shoplifting as political resistance, and share jokes and stories about the practice. we construct three different ""problems"" and imagine studies that might result from applying different design approaches: design against crime; critical design and value sensitive design. through these studies we highlight how interpretations of the same data can lead to radically different design responses. we conclude by discussing problem making as a historically and politically contingent process that allow researchers to connect data and design according to certain moral and ethical principles. we have argued that framing a problem is not a natural consequence of working with data but rather an act of creative making that shapes design outcomes and satisfies expectations. whether a particular perspective is explicitly stated or not there are no neutral design responses to data. we have illustrated this argument with three different constructions of “problems” relating to the same data from an online community of teen shoplifters. our examples are not intended to cover the whole hci research field but rather, provide a glimpse into the potential to generate diversity in reponse to data and to acknowledge the specific interests and assumptions of any particular research audience. problems and solutions are not “out there” waiting to be identified but are rather the product of particular analytical lenses that foreground certain connections between data and design. in turn, there are no inherent or inevitable relationships between data and design but rather historically and politically informed choices.",71
Group vs Individual: Impact of TOUCH and TILT Cross-Device Interactions on Mixed-Focus Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656541,"cross-device environments (xdes) have been developed to support a multitude of collaborative activities. yet, little is known about how different cross-device interaction techniques impact group collaboration, including how their impact on independent and joint work that often occurs during group work. in this work, we explore the impact of two xde data browsing techniques: touch and tilt. through a mixed-methods study of a collaborative sensemaking task, we show that touch and tilt have distinct impacts on how groups accomplish, and shift between, independent and joint work. finally, we reflect on these findings and how they can more generally inform the design of xdes. we presented results from an exploratory, laboratory-based study in which pairs of participants performed a series of collaborative sensemaking tasks using two cross-device data browsing techniques: touch and tilt. our qualitative analyses show that cross-device interaction techniques can profoundly influence collaborative process. while tilt facilitated access to out-of-reach data, especially during independent data browsing, touch better supported tightly synchronized discussion of data. further investigation is warranted to determine how best to balance these competing group needs in xdes. in particular, they point to a need to better understand how techniques support individual and joint work, but also transitions between the two modes.",72
Back to Analogue: Self-Reporting for Parkinson's Disease,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656542,"we report the process used to create artefacts for self-reporting parkinson's disease symptoms. our premise was that a technology-based approach would provide participants with an effective, flexible, and resilient technique. after testing four prototypes using bluetooth, nfc, and a microcontroller we accomplished almost full compliance and high acceptance using a paper diary to track day-to-day fluctuations over 49 days. this diary is tailored to each patient's condition, does not require any handwriting, allows for implicit reminders, provides recording flexibility, and its answers can be encoded automatically. we share five design implications for future parkinson's self-reporting artefacts: reduce participant completion demand, design to offset the effect of tremor on input, enable implicit reminders, design for positive and negative consequences of increased awareness of symptoms, and consider the effects of handwritten notes in compliance, encoding burden, and data quality. during the agile prototyping of the different self-reporting tools described above, we found out that pen and paper are a suitable method to collect longitudinal day-to-day fluctuations. p1-7’s feedback provided us with a detailed view of the problems and virtues of our prototypes that were the base to conduct each redesign. although our decision process was tied up to a set of constraints, a button-based or app-based tool might be the right choice under different circumstances [8]. for example, when the chosen device does not interfere with other aspects of the monitoring study. therefore, in line with other authors, we do not advocate the use of either analogue or electronic approaches as a silver bullet, but rather recommend tailoring either option to the study’s goals. we highlight the attributes that favour our paper diary compared to some technologies. it is cheap at £3.5 per unit, accessible, frictionless, personalised, portable, low-demand, automatically encoded, straightforward and flexible. these are all characteristics that make it a suitable tool for ground truth data collection in our parent study.",73
The Hide and Seek of Workspace: Towards Human-Centric Sustainable Architecture,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656543,"this contribution exemplifies how the study of space perception and its impact on space-use behavior can inform sustainable architecture. we describe our attempt to integrate the methods of user research in an architectural project that was focused on optimization of space usage. in an office building, two large office rooms were refurbished to provide desk-sharing opportunities through hot-desking. we studied the space-use behavior of 33 office workers over eight weeks in those two rooms as well as their occasional presence in ten other areas (cafeteria, atrium, meeting rooms, etc.). quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed to understand the nature and nuances of space occupancy at the scope of the building and within the refurbished offices. while at the scope of building the patterns of movements between rooms were found to be related to the professional profile of the users, at the scope of office the occupancy patterns were influenced by the spatial design of workspaces. more precisely, certain visual attributes of a workspace, namely visual exposure and visual openness, could determine whether or not it was regularly used. in this paper, we describe our findings in detail and discuss their implications for sustainable building design. our contributions as hci researchers have complemented and guided the architectural project objectives and procedures at different stages of the project. in addition, our involvement with both the inhabitants and stakeholders coalesced their respective perceptions and expectations towards the establishment of a homogeneous framework for dialogue. with the stakeholders, we collaboratively framed the problem related to the less than optimal use of spaces, followed by the identification of intensification as a potential solution. besides, the outcomes of co-design sessions and the user evaluation of refurbished offices were subjected to participatory analyses and discussions with the stakeholders. furthermore, our role in engaging the occupants to collectively devise strategies for the sustainable use of space manifested in the redesign of the connective and calm rooms, followed by their evaluation by the occupants. we experienced that it is only through such continual confluent measures that the human factors can be profoundly assimilated and acknowledged as an essential component in the processes of problem formulation and solution seeking in sustainable architecture.",74
"How Teens with Visual Impairments Take, Edit, and Share Photos on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656544,"we contribute a qualitative investigation of how teens with visual impairments (vip) access smartphone photography, from the time they take photos through editing and sharing them on social media. we observed that they largely want to engage with photos visually, similarly to their sighted peers, and have developed strategies around photo capture, editing, sharing, and consumption that attempt to mitigate usability limitations of current photography and social media apps. we demonstrate the need for more work examining how young people with low vision engage with smartphone photography and social media, as they are heavy users of such technologies and have challenges distinct from their totally blind counterparts. we conclude with design considerations to alleviate the usability barriers we uncovered and for making smartphone photography and social media more accessible and relevant for vips. in this paper, we presented a qualitative investigation of how visually impaired teens engage with smartphone photography and social media platforms popular among their peers. though they encounter challenges using these apps, they leverage several compensatory strategies that inspired our design recommendations. through our interviews with visually impaired teens, we aimed not to provide representative experiences of this user group, but rich accounts that push back on misconceptions about how people with visual impairments experience photography. we learned that teens who are blind or low vision are not disinterested in photography. in fact, they were interested in engaging with photos visually as much as possible, as p4 succinctly described, “i’m a really visual person for being visually impaired.” despite visual impairment, these teens enjoy smartphone photography and social media apps popular among their peers, even when they are premised on photos and ephemerality. we hope these findings serve as motivation for other types of studies on how visually impaired people, and particularly young people who are heavy technology users, engage with popular technologies and social media.",75
Attending to Slowness and Temporality with Olly and Slow Game: A Design Inquiry Into Supporting Longer-Term Relations with Everyday Computational Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656655,"slowness has emerged as a rich lens to frame hci investigations into supporting longer-term human-technology relations. yet, there is a need to further address how we design for slowness on conceptual and practical levels. drawing on the concepts of unawareness, intersections, and ensembles, we contribute an investigation into designing for slowness and temporality grounded in design practice through two cases: olly and slow game. we designed these artifacts over two and a half years with careful attention to how the set of concepts influenced key design decisions in terms of their form, materials, and computational qualities. our designer-researcher approach revealed that, when put into practice, the concepts helped generatively grapple with slowness and temporality, but are in need of further development to be mobilized for design. we critically reflect on insights emerging across our practice-based research to reflexively refine the concepts and better support future hci research and practice. we have described and critically reflected on our collective practice of designing and making olly and slow game. our aim was to generatively inquire into how unawareness, intersections, and ensembles could offer conceptual scaffolding for grappling with slowness and temporality in design. we closely attended to how this set of concepts influenced key design decisions that structured and expressed time across the materiality, form, and computational qualities of our design artifacts. through a reflexive designer-researcher approach, our work provides insights into how the quality of independence generated through unawareness could enable design artifacts to evoke a rich and unique slower temporal expression. intersections and ensembles helped operationalize unawareness through refocusing our attention beyond interactivity toward subtle design qualities that, over time, could give rise to a wider range of relations among people, things, and environments. insights from our research revealed that these concepts need not be treated so rigidly when applied in practice. in summary, the more flexible, revised vision of these concepts offer promise to be scaffolded in future efforts to design for slowness and temporality by shifting the primacy of what we attend to in design: (i) for materials, focus shifts to how they evoke and will persist through time beyond how they feel ‘now’; (ii) for physical form, prominence is given to decisions that explicitly invite encounters with other things as well as other people; (iii) for computation, emphasis expands beyond immediate response time to crafting a temporal pacing that is distinct, indeterminate, and ongoing. importantly, our aim is not to be prescriptive or conclusive. a multiplicity of approaches is needed to open up new ways of conceptualizing and designing diverse expressions of time as technology increasingly becomes embedded in everyday life. we hope our work will inspire future hci research and practice initiatives into designing for slowness and temporality. more generally, we hope the critical reflective reporting of our designer-researcher approach can be appreciated as an effort to better support design-oriented forms of knowledge production in the hci community.",76
VirtualGrasp: Leveraging Experience of Interacting with Physical Objects to Facilitate Digital Object Retrieval,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656656,"we propose virtualgrasp, a novel gestural approach to retrieve virtual objects in virtual reality. using virtualgrasp, a user retrieves an object by performing a barehanded gesture as if grasping its physical counterpart. the object-gesture mapping under this metaphor is of high intuitiveness, which enables users to easily discover, remember the gestures to retrieve the objects. we conducted three user studies to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. progressively, we investigated the consensus of the object-gesture mapping across users, the expressivity of grasping gestures, and the learnability and performance of the approach. results showed that users achieved high agreement on the mapping, with an average agreement score [35] of 0.68 (sd=0.27). without exposure to the gestures, users successfully retrieved 76% objects with virtualgrasp. a week after learning the mapping, they could recall the gestures for 93% objects. we propose virtualgrasp, an object retrieval approach for vr applications. with virtualgrasp, a user retrieves a virtual object by performing an in-air gesture which he/she uses to grasp or interact with its physical counterpart. through three studies, we evaluated the consistency of object-gesture mappings across users, the expressivity of the grasping gestures and the performance of retrieving objects using this approach. results have confirmed that users could reach high agreement on the mappings, that the object-gesture pairs could be accurately recognized by algorithms, and that users could discover the gestures by themselves and also enjoyed the experience. we also discuss the design implications, potential applications and limitations of this approach.",77
Harvesting Caregiving Knowledge: Design Considerations for Integrating Volunteer Input in Dementia Care,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656657,"improving volunteer performance leads to better caregiving in dementia care settings. however, caregiving knowledge systems have been focused on eliciting and sharing expert, primary caregiver knowledge, rather than volunteer-provided knowledge. through the use of an experience prototype, we explored the content of volunteer caregiver knowledge and identified ways in which such non-expert knowledge can be useful to dementia care. by using lay language, sharing information specific to the client and collaboratively finding strategies for interaction, volunteers were able to boost the effectiveness of future volunteers. therapists who reviewed the content affirmed the reliability of volunteer caregiver knowledge and placed value on its recency, variety and its ability to help bridge language and professional barriers. we discuss how future systems designed for eliciting and sharing volunteer caregiver knowledge can be used to promote better dementia care. in this paper, we describe volunteer-provided content in terms of its structure and mechanisms for iterative improvement of content quality. despite using the insights of inexperienced, untrained volunteers, we show that the collaborative sharing of such content provides sufficient knowledge for successive volunteers to be more effective when interacting with people with dementia. additionally, we developed a sense of the relative value of non-expert, non-kin input within the dementia care context. we offered design considerations for further optimizing the contribution of volunteer-provided content to dementia care.",78
Gamification for Self-Tracking: From World of Warcraft to the Design of Personal Informatics Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656658,"world of warcraft (wow) may be a source of inspiration to enrich the personal informatics systems user's experience and, at the same time, improve gamification design. through the findings of a four-year reflexive ethnography in wow, i outline how its game design elements support players in making sense of their own data, emphasizing how ""game numbers"" are turned into meanings. on the basis of the study results, i propose a series of design considerations to be used in the design of self-tracking systems, which recommend to embody data into digital entities, provide different analytical tools depending on the users' expertise through a flexible model, and foster the formation of ""communities of practice"" in order to support learning processes. in this work, i made two main contributions. first, i described how wow’s players learn to manage the quantitative information needed to play the game at best, how they ascribe meaning to numbers, and how they turn them into action. second i provided a series of design considerations to transfer wow’s best practices in supporting players making sense of their data to pi domain.",79
Pinpointing: Precise Head- and Eye-Based Target Selection for Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656659,"head and eye movement can be leveraged to improve the user's interaction repertoire for wearable displays. head movements are deliberate and accurate, and provide the current state-of-the-art pointing technique. eye gaze can potentially be faster and more ergonomic, but suffers from low accuracy due to calibration errors and drift of wearable eye-tracking sensors. this work investigates precise, multimodal selection techniques using head motion and eye gaze. a comparison of speed and pointing accuracy reveals the relative merits of each method, including the achievable target size for robust selection. we demonstrate and discuss example applications for augmented reality, including compact menus with deep structure, and a proof-of-concept method for on-line correction of calibration drift. in summary, this work has taken a close look at a variety of multimodal techniques for precision target selection in ar. we investigated both eye gaze and head pointing combined with refinement provided by a handheld device, hand gesture input and scaled head motion. a user study showed trade-offs of different variations of pinpointing. confirming previous work, eye gaze input alone is faster than head pointing, but the head pointing allows greater targeting accuracy. a previously unexplored use of scaled head refinement proved to be the most accurate, although participants primarily preferred device input and found gestures required the most effort. we further demonstrated two applications for pinpointing, compact menu selection and online correction of eye gaze calibration. further work is required to reproduce these techniques on a wider variety of device hardware and to explore more sophisticated applications such as situated analytics and in-situ cad.",80
Sketch&Stitch: Interactive Embroidery for E-textiles,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656650,"e-textiles are fabrics that integrate electronic circuits and components. makers use them to create interactive clothing, furniture, and toys. however, this requires significant manual labor and skills, and using technology-centric design tools. we introduce sketch&stitch, an interactive embroidery system to create e-textiles using a traditional crafting approach: users draw their art and circuit directly on fabric using colored pens. the system takes a picture of the sketch, converts it to embroidery patterns, and sends them to an embroidery machine. alternating between sketching and stitching, users build and test their design incrementally. sketch&stitch features circuitry stickers representing circuit boards, components, and custom stitch patterns for wire crossings to insulate, and various textile touch sensors such as pushbuttons, sliders, and 2d touchpads. circuitry stickers serve as placeholders during design. using computer vision, they are recognized and replaced later in the appropriate embroidery phases. we close with technical considerations and application examples. this paper introduced sketch&stitch, an interactive system for creating e-textiles quickly and iteratively. it enables a new design workflow that combines physical sketching with an embroidery machine, offering users the benefits of direct making and the power of digital tools. it implements a digitization algorithm for converting a sketch to an embroidery. we described novel stitch patterns for attaching electronics, shielding wire crossings, and integrating sensors (pushbuttons, sliders, touchpads) directly on fabric. an empirical evaluation of the technical stitches was presented. finally, we demonstrated the potential and advantages of our workflow.",81
Using Stakeholder Theory to Examine Drivers' Stake in Uber,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656651,"uber is a ride-sharing platform that is part of the 'gig-economy,' where the platform supports and coordinates a labor market in which there are a large number of ephemeral, piecemeal jobs. despite numerous efforts to understand the impacts of these platforms and their algorithms on uber drivers, how to better serve and support drivers with these platforms remains an open challenge. in this paper, we frame uber through the lens of stakeholder theory to highlight drivers' position in the workplace, which helps inform the design of a more ethical and effective platform. to this end, we analyzed uber drivers' forum discussions about their lived experiences of working with the uber platform. we identify and discuss the impact of the stakes that drivers have in relation to both the uber corporation and their passengers, and look at how these stakes impact both the platform and drivers' practices.",82
"Conversations in the Eye of the Storm: At-Scale Features of Conversational Structure in a High-Tempo, High-Stakes Microblogging Environment",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656652,"this work propels social media research beyond the single post as the unit of analysis toward fuller treatment of interaction by making the construct of the conversation analytically available. we offer a method for constructing @reply conversations in twitter to apprehend social media conversational features at scale. we apply this method to the high-tempo, high-stakes environment of 2012's hurricane sandy, with its high volume of online talk by affected locals and distinct disaster-stage phasing by which to consider interactional difference. we investigate the temporality of conversations; the relationality of who speaks to whom; the number and kind of conversationalists; and how content affects temporal features. the analysis reveals that, during the height of the emergency, people expand conversations both in number and kind of conversational partners-just as their information search intensifies. this expansion contributes to longer, slower-paced conversations in the high-emergency period, suggesting reliance on online relationships during times of greatest uncertainty. this work expands social media research from analyzing single twitter posts to considering whole conversations by placing monologues, dialogues, and group discussions of twitterers who are geographically vulnerable at the analytical center. in offering approaches for making conversations analytically available, this work contributes to social computing research for crisis informatics that can now investigate more nuanced questions about the social roles that twitterers play, how they draw on social capital in protective decision making, and how online conversations interweave with the activities on the ground.",83
Interactive Extraction of Examples from Existing Code,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656653,"programmers frequently learn from examples produced and shared by other programmers. however, it can be challenging and time-consuming to produce concise, working code examples. we conducted a formative study where 12 participants made examples based on their own code. this revealed a key hurdle: making meaningful simplifications without introducing errors. based on this insight, we designed a mixed-initiative tool, codescoop, to help programmers extract executable, simplified code from existing code. codescoop enables programmers to ""scoop"" out a relevant subset of code. techniques include selectively including control structures and recording an execution trace that allows authors to substitute literal values for code and variables. in a controlled study with 19 participants, codescoop helped programmers extract executable code examples with the intended behavior more easily than with a standard code editor. we developed codescoop, a mixed-initiative interaction technique to enable programmers to extract executable code examples from existing code. our study shows that programmers can use such tools to successfully extract examples. furthermore, the resulting “scoops” provide value over automatically extracted slices. we believe tools like codescoop will ultimately enable programmers to more quickly and effectively share their knowledge through examples.",84
"Haptic Revolver: Touch, Shear, Texture, and Shape Rendering on a Reconfigurable Virtual Reality Controller",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656654,"we present haptic revolver, a handheld virtual reality controller that renders fingertip haptics when interacting with virtual surfaces. haptic revolver's core haptic element is an actuated wheel that raises and lowers underneath the finger to render contact with a virtual surface. as the user's finger moves along the surface of an object, the controller spins the wheel to render shear forces and motion under the fingertip. the wheel is interchangeable and can contain physical textures, shapes, edges, or active elements to provide different sensations to the user. because the controller is spatially tracked, these physical features can be spatially registered with the geometry of the virtual environment and rendered on-demand. we evaluated haptic revolver in two studies to understand how wheel speed and direction impact perceived realism. we also report qualitative feedback from users who explored three application scenarios with our controller. haptic revolver is a general-purpose handheld vr controller that goes beyond vibrotactile stimulation to render touch contact with virtual surfaces, motion along a surface, textures, and shapes using interchangeable haptic wheels. by customizing wheels for the virtual environment, designers can use haptic revolver to render realistic haptic feedback on the fngertip. we demonstrated techniques to render motion along a surface in two dimensions and adapt a particular wheel for use in arbitrary scenes. we conducted two user studies to inform and validate the design of our haptic rendering techniques and a third study to elicit qualitative feedback from participants. we believe that haptic revolver offers high-fdelity haptic rendering with clear advantages over vibrotactile solutions and we hope others will build upon our design to continue enabling better haptic experiences for vr.",85
Influences of Human Cognition and Visual Behavior on Password Strength during Picture Password Composition,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656665,"visual attention, search, processing and comprehension are important cognitive tasks during a graphical password composition activity. aiming to shed light on whether individual differences on visual behavior affect the strength of the created passwords, we conducted an eye-tracking study (n=36), and adopted an accredited cognitive style theory to interpret the results. the analysis revealed that users with different cognitive styles followed different patterns of visual behavior which affected the strength of the created passwords. motivated, by the results of the first study, we introduced adaptive characteristics to the user authentication mechanism, aiming to assist specific cognitive style user groups to create more secure passwords, and conducted a second study with a new sample (n=40) to test the adaptive characteristics. results strengthen our assumptions that adaptive mechanisms based on users' differences in cognitive and visual behavior uncover a new perspective for improving the password's strength within graphical user authentication realms. in this paper, we first reported the results of an eye-tracking study aiming to investigate the effects of fd-i cognitive style on the created passwords’ strength using a cued recall gua scheme and explain the results considering the visual behavior. significant differences were revealed between the created passwords’ strength of fds and fis, and on the visual behavior of fds and fis which were strongly correlated with the passwords’ strength. hence, this paper provides evidence that users with different cognitive style follow different strategies when creating graphical passwords on images of varying complexity and their visual behavior suggests whether their choices will lead to strong passwords. triggered by the results of the first study, we designed an assistive mechanism based on the visual behavior of the fds and the fis, which we used as saliency mask on the same background images, and conducted a comparative study. results reveal that the approach we suggested improved the created passwords’ strength, reinforcing our assumption that adaptive mechanisms based on the cognitive styles, can provide a feasible solution for creating stronger passwords. therefore, this work provides evidence that the cognitive styles of the users can be used to provide personalized experiences. the results of our study are summarized in table 2. we are encouraged by the results of our work that using cognitive styles for designing personalized assistive features for gua mechanisms is worth further exploration, and we are eager to design and evaluate more cognitive style-based features to better support the users when creating graphical passwords. apart from password creation, we intend to investigate the effects of cognitive styles in login, and design and test different adaptive policies. considering the shift towards immersive technologies and the increasing role of the eye in such environments, there is room for expanding our research in this context.",86
Supporting Workplace Detachment and Reattachment with Conversational Intelligence,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656666,"research has shown that productivity is mediated by an individual's ability to detach from their work at the end of the day and reattach with it when they return the next day. in this paper we explore the extent to which structured dialogues, focused on individuals' work-related tasks or emotions, can help them with the detachment and reattachment processes. our inquiry is driven with switchbot, a conversational bot which engages with workers at the start and end of their work day. after preliminarily validating the design of a detachment and reattachment dialogue frame-work with 108 crowdworkers, we study switchbot's use in-situ for 14 days with 34 information workers. we find that workers send fewer e-mails after work hours and spend a larger percentage of their first hour at work using productivity applications than they normally would when using switchbot. further, we find that productivity gains were better sustained when conversations focused on work-related emotions. our results suggest that conversational bots can be effective tools for aiding workplace detachment and reattachment and help people make successful use of their time on and off the job. in this study, we reported findings from an in-situ study that indicate bots can be effective tools for helping information workers detach from and reattach with work. we introduced a conversational detachment-reattachment framework in which we included two, unique models of dialogue for detaching from work and reattaching with work. we presented and evaluated switchbot, a bot that implements the detachment-reattachment framework. we showed evidence that suggests interacting with switchbot before the start and end of the workday assists information workers in psychologically detaching from work and reattaching with work the next day. future work includes studying non-information workers, examining more hybrid models of dialogue, and examining how bots can be tools for transitioning between tasks in the workplace as well as at home.",87
iTurk: Turning Passive Haptics into Active Haptics by Making Users Reconfigure Props in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656667,"we present a system that complements virtual reality experiences with passive props, yet still allows modifying the virtual world at runtime. the main contribution of our system is that it does not require any actuators; instead, our system employs the user to reconfigure and actuate otherwise passive props. we demonstrate a foldable prop that users reconfigure to represent a suitcase, fuse cabinet, railing, and a seat. a second prop, suspended from a long pendulum, not only stands in for inanimate objects, but also for objects that move and demonstrate proactive behavior, such as a group of flying droids that physically attack the user. our approach conveys a sense of a living, animate world, when in reality the user is the only animate entity present in the system, complemented with only one or two physical props. in our study, participants rated their experience as more enjoyable and realistic than a corresponding no-haptics condition. in this paper, we presented iturk, a system that complements virtual reality experiences with passive props, yet still allows modifying the virtual world at runtime. the main contribution behind iturk is the idea of using users to reconfigure and animate otherwise passive props in virtual reality. first, user-based reconfiguration of props allows creating arbitrary sequences of rooms, each of which reuses the same physical space and the physical props. second, animated props, such as the pendulum, allow rendering animate objects, which brings liveliness to the resulting virtual worlds. this allows iturk to realize some of the benefits that have traditionally only been achieved with passive haptics such as actuated either by mechanical actuators (robotic graphics [6] or human actuators (turkdeck [2]). as future work, we are planning on exploring self-reconfiguring props based on energy harvesting.",88
"Clusters, Trends, and Outliers: How Immersive Technologies Can Facilitate the Collaborative Analysis of Multidimensional Data",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656668,"immersive technologies such as augmented reality devices are opening up a new design space for the visual analysis of data. this paper studies the potential of an augmented reality environment for the purpose of collaborative analysis of multidimensional, abstract data. we present art, a collaborative analysis tool to visualize multidimensional data in augmented reality using an interactive, 3d parallel coordinates visualization. the visualization is anchored to a touch-sensitive tabletop, benefiting from well-established interaction techniques. the results of group-based, expert walkthroughs show that art can facilitate immersion in the data, a fluid analysis process, and collaboration. based on the results, we provide a set of guidelines and discuss future research areas to foster the development of immersive technologies as tools for the collaborative analysis of multidimensional data. in this work we address the challenge of collaboratively analyzing multidimensional, abstract data. we present art, a system that leverages the strengths of ar environments. the stereoscopic presentation in large-scale space allows for egocentric navigation and can therefore reduce the effects of overplotting when large data sets are visualized. the ar environments further allow for natural communication and coordination between collaborators. art combines the interaction on a touch-sensitive tabletop with a 3d visualization in ar above the tabletop. this combination of ar with touch input potentially enhances interaction over a gesture-based system due to its familiar, precise, physically undemanding, and fluid interaction. the results of group-based expert walkthroughs show that art can facilitate immersion in the data, a fluid analysis process, and collaboration. the interaction based on touch input allowed participants to fluidly operate the feature-rich systems, from which the integrated features provided the means to analyze multidimensional clusters, trends, and outliers. based on these findings, we provide guidelines for the design of interactive visualizations using immersive technologies. in addition, we identify research directions to further facilitate the collaborative analysis of multidimensional data in ar environments.",89
Methods for Evaluation of Imperfect Captioning Tools by Deaf or Hard-of-Hearing Users at Different Reading Literacy Levels,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656669,"as automatic speech recognition (asr) improves in accuracy, it may become useful for transcribing spoken text in real-time for deaf and hard-of-hearing (dhh) individuals. to quantify users' comprehension and opinion of automatic captions, which inevitably contain some errors, we must identify appropriate methodologies for evaluation studies with dhh users, including quantitative measurement instruments suitable to the various literacy levels among the dhh population. a literature review guided our selection of several probes (e.g. multiple-choice comprehension-question accuracy or response time, scalar-questions about user estimation of asr errors or their impact, users' numerical estimation of accuracy), which we evaluated in a lab study with dhh users, wherein their literacy levels and the actual accuracy of each caption stimulus were factors. for some probes, participants with lower literacy had more positive subjective responses overall, and, for participants with particular literacy score ranges, some probes were insufficiently sensitive to distinguish between caption accuracy levels. through a lab study with 107 dhh participants evaluating asr-based captions of various known accuracy levels, we have compared the scores recorded from various question types. we found that some question types are effective at distinguishing accuracy levels of captions, for responses collected from participants within particular literacy ranges. we also found that for some question types, participants with higher literacy levels give more critical subjective responses and have higher comprehension question scores. based on this, we provide the following methodological recommendations to researchers conducting evaluations of captioning technology in studies with dhh participants: • because the literacy level of participants influences their response scores, researchers should report the literacy level of the participants in their studies – or control for this factor through reported screening criteria. • if participants’ literacy levels are diverse, researchers should report results separately for those at each level. • when selecting questions to include in the study, researchers should consider the literacy level of their participants and the accuracy level of their caption stimuli, to select an appropriate question type capable of discriminating caption quality (i.e. consult table 1). • given that question types may differ in their ability to distinguish caption quality at different accuracy levels, researchers should consider their caption accuracy, e.g. using metrics such as wer, and report these values. • since comprehension question scores are based on several factors, including: the quality of the original text, the difficulty of the question, and the reading skill level of the respondent – such questions must be appropriately tailored to the participants’ literacy skills. for instance, participants with above-average fluency may better infer the erroneous/missing information in captions. there were several limitations to our study: we chose the ubiquitous wer as an accuracy metric, but newer metrics that weigh the importance of each word may better represent accuracy perceptions of dhh users [19]. our caption stimuli consisted of a single genre (simulation of a meeting) with a script at a particular reading level (as measured by flesch-kincaid’s formulas); however, we did not experiment with genres or reading-levels of stimuli in this study, and doing so might reveal unforeseen effects. further, while we used wrat to group participants into literacy levels, with our lowest group including the lowest range of wrat scores, we could have recruited greater numbers of participants with high literacy levels, to enable more subdivision at the higher end of the wrat scale – or utilized a different literacy test with greater ability to distinguish individuals at the extremes of the literacy scale. our study included participants recruited from a university campus; researchers should use caution when generalizing our results to other dhh users, e.g. younger students or older adults in the workforce. finally, our study did not include all possible question-type probes, e.g. open-ended questions or eye-tracking metrics, as in some prior work. this methodological study has been conducted as part of a larger research project at our lab to investigate the use of asr-based captioning for use by dhh individuals in oneon-one meetings with hearing colleagues, e.g. in workplace settings. in future work, we plan to design and develop a prototype system, which we will evaluate in user studies. we will make use of the methodological guidelines above, and we may generate revisions to them based on our experiences in conducting further studies with dhh users.",90
Effects of Individual Differences in Blocking Workplace Distractions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656660,"information workers are experiencing ever-increasing online distractions in the workplace, and software to block distractions is becoming more popular. we conducted an exploratory field study with 32 information workers in their workplace using software to block online distractions for one week. we discovered that with online distractions blocked, participants assessed their focus and productivity to be significantly higher. those who benefited most were those who reported being less in control of their work, associated with personality traits of lower conscientiousness and lack of perseverence. unexpectedly, those reporting higher control of work experienced a cost of higher workload with online distractions blocked. those who reported the greatest increase in focus with distractions blocked were those who were more susceptible to social media distractions. without distractions, people with higher control of work worked longer stretches without physical breaks, with consequently higher stress. we present design recommendations to promote focus for our observed coping behaviors. online distractions are a controversial aspect of our current technology-mediated workplaces. a number of commercial solutions, prototypes and workplace policies have been developed to address the perceived negative aspects of online distractions. however, whether these strategies help has not been well studied. rather than ask people hypothetically to report experiences, our participants actually experienced how blocking distractions affected their work. for most, cutting off workplace distractions increases focus and productivity. our study is a first step in suggesting that individual differences in managing distractions is important to consider in designing software to block distractions. people who benefited the most were those who felt less in control of computer work and most susceptible to social distractions. however, our results on the role of personality need to be verified with further research. as we construct workplaces of the future, we need to understand how technology support can help people better manage their distractions, so as to integrate them more beneficially into their work practices.",91
Dynamic Demographics: Lessons from a Large-Scale Census of Performative Possibilities in Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656661,"while much popular discussion of representation in games exists, there is very little rigorously collected data available from which to draw direct conclusions. in this study, we set out to address this gap by performing a census of playable characters across a large sample of contemporary games. we gathered data from 200 games including independently published (""indie"") games and so-called ""aaa"" titles from large publishers. while our initial analysis yielded some insight into the landscape of playable characters, it also highlighted the contingent, negotiated, and interpretive nature of representation in games. this led to additional analysis that emphasized the ways in which this negotiation manifests in research in the methods and metrics used to quantify representation. we argue that researchers studying representation in games need to treat it as a possibility space for a multitude of potential interpretations rather than a singular, measurable, phenomenon. nakamura describes the concept of “menu-driven identities” to indicate how structurally and functionally imposed limitations narrow “the field of representation” and “work to deny the existence of ways of being raced that don’t fit neatly into categorizable boxes” [24]. while nakamura’s focus is race, she includes gender in this analysis as well. nakamura argues how menus serve to constrain possibility, rather than expand it. we might adapt nakamura’s concept by considering “menu-driven bodies,” or “menu-driven performances,” as we are not expressly able to address the identities of either the characters or the players in a study like this, only the possibility space within which identity work may occur. we too are concerned with the ways that race, gender, and more do not fit neatly into boxes, despite our own, and many other scholars’ attempts at classification, and quantification. any discussion of representation in media, especially as it pertains to race and gender carries a risk of poorly translating rigid, marginalizing categorizations from broader culture to the virtual. as we transform our research, we attempt to mitigate this risk by describing characters only as collective, probabilistic, interpretations. for the next steps of this research, rather than coding each character according to a single, or even small consensus reading, we are developing an online tool that enables collaborative, composite readings. instead of a certain character being recorded as white, black, latinx, or asian, etc., they are recorded as being read white x%, latinx y% by those who have contributed their judgements through an online survey-based tool. we may not be able to rely on the perspective of only one or two researchers, but we can invite others to collaborate. this data becomes about so much more than race, or any single identifier as we collect information on apparent sex and gender, ability, age, etc. we live in a world where these identities are complex, contingent, and constructed, and any attempt at capturing that prismatic reality must refrain from foreclosing upon them. in this paper we have provided our reading on a corpus of playable characters that illustrates a certain perspective on the landscape of representation in these games. but, perhaps more importantly, this collection of interpretations and the methodological shift away from inter-rater reliability and toward inter-rater variability that we suggest based on it, should help not only our ongoing research as we continue to develop it, but scholars interested in related work.",92
Philosophers Living with the Tilting Bowl,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656662,"this paper reports on a postphenomenological inquiry of six trained philosophers, who as study participants lived with and reflected on a research product we designed known as the tilting bowl: a ceramic bowl that unpredictably but gently tilts multiple times daily. the tilting bowl is a counterfactual artifact that is designed specifically for this study as part of a material speculation approach to design research. a postphenomenological inquiry looks to describe and analyze accounts of relationships between humans and technological artifacts, and how each mutually shapes the other through mediations that form the human subjectivity and objectivity of any given situation. this paper contributes an empirical account and analysis of the relations that emerged (background and alterity) and the relativistic views that co-constitute the philosophers, tilting bowl, and their specific worlds. the findings demonstrate the relevance of this philosophical framing to fundamentally and broadly understand how people engage digital artifacts. an aim of this study is to enhance our philosophical understanding of digital artifacts through exploring alternatives with a counterfactual artifact and lived-with reflections of trained philosophers. we provided descriptive and analytical accounts of background and alterity relations shared with the tilting bowl that focus on different qualities of presence within these relations. we provide detailed and rich relativistic views of our philosophers, tilting bowl, and their specific worlds that account for technologies in new ways for hci. additionally, we detailed the characteristics of our material speculation and co-speculation approach in the light of the postphenomenological studies, which we see as having great potential to be extended with the support of other hci and design research methods. more generally, we aimed to further a mutually beneficial dialogue between hci and postphenomenology.",93
LumiWatch: On-Arm Projected Graphics and Touch Input,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656663,"compact, worn computers with projected, on-skin touch interfaces have been a long-standing yet elusive goal, largely written off as science fiction. such devices offer the potential to mitigate the significant human input/output bottleneck inherent in worn devices with small screens. in this work, we present the first fully functional and self-contained projection smartwatch implementation, containing the requisite compute, power, projection and touch-sensing capabilities. our watch offers roughly 40 sq. cm of interactive surface area -- more than five times that of a typical smartwatch display. we demonstrate continuous 2d finger tracking with interactive, rectified graphics, transforming the arm into a touchscreen. we discuss our hardware and software implementation, as well as evaluation results regarding touch accuracy and projection visibility. in this paper, we have presented lumiwatch, a first-of-itskind smartwatch with integrated projector and touch sensing in a commercially viable form factor. developing this prototype required solving a number of difficult problems, including development of a suitable projector module, shallow-angle projection onto curved arms, and accurate 2d finger tracking. through a combination of custom hardware and software, our prototype smartwatch provides a large touchscreen-like interface directly on a wearer’s arm. lumiwatch presents a novel combination of hardware and software capabilities, moving the vision of on-skin interaction significantly closer to reality and illuminating the imminent feasibility of projection-enabled wearables.",94
Hit-or-Wait: Coordinating Opportunistic Low-effort Contributions to Achieve Global Outcomes in On-the-go Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656664,"we consider the challenge of motivating and coordinating large numbers of people to contribute to solving local, communal problems through their existing routines. in order to design such ""on-the-go crowdsourcing"" systems, there is a need for mechanisms that can effectively coordinate contributions to address problem solving needs in the physical world while leveraging people's existing mobility with minimal disruption. we thus introduce hit-or-wait, a general decision-theoretic mechanism that intelligently controls decisions over when to notify a person of a task, in ways that reason both about system needs across tasks and about a helper's changing patterns of mobility. through simulations and a field study in the context of community-based lost-and-found, we demonstrate that using hit-or-wait enables a system to make efficient use of people's contributions with minimal disruptions to their routines without the need for explicit coordination. interviews with field study participants further suggest that highlighting an individual's contribution to the global goal may help people value their contributions more.",95
An Empirical Exploration of Mindfulness Design Using Solo Travel Domain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656675,"despite recent popularity of mindfulness smartphone applications and an interest in incorporating mindfulness into new technologies, existing applications tend to focus mainly on its meditation dimension. in this paper, we review existing literature on digital and traditional mindfulness to map its design space and synthesize the findings with our prior research on designing for aesthetic needs. we identify ""recollection"" and ""evaluation"" as two important dimensions of mindfulness that have not yet been incorporated into popular digital tools. through a two-phase design activity over 16 months, we developed coloraway, an innovative tool that promotes mindfulness through interaction with modified travel photos. recruited participants evaluated coloraway and offered unique insights into how mindfulness can be better designed. we also discuss how the process of designing for mindfulness can possibly inform the design of personal technology. this research is part of a larger study that builds on scholarly research and theories with the goal of designing interactive technologies for solo travelers. this research is a small contribution to an ongoing effort to study the design of technology to support mindfulness, in which we identified and focused on two relatively unexplored dimensions of mindfulness: “recollection” and “evaluation.” we presented the results of a qualitative analysis that explored new opportunities to design for these two dimensions. our study consisted of two design phases based on the data from the larger study. in phase 1, we designed coloraway using aesthetics principles. in this phase, we noticed a connection between aesthetics and mindfulness, which led us to redesign coloraway in phase 2 based on the two dimensions of mindfulness. we discussed the challenges of designing for mindfulness and suggested important design considerations. we initially named the project coloraway, envisioning that a coloring book for adults may be a fun way to satisfy their aesthetic needs. however, after phase 2, we realized that the project name and the paper prototype in the shape of a coloring book might have influenced participants’ interactions with the photos. for future developments, we would change the name to something that wouldn’t restrict users to only think of it as a coloring book. we also believe that turning the paper prototype into a digital format can address this concern as well. in addition, abstracting the photos by leaving all the outlines naturally guided and restricted some of the participants to follow the lines and fill them out. in the future developments, we’d like to experiment with other photo alteration techniques to leave more room for creativity and imagination, including activities other than drawing and coloring. we will also look for better ways to engage users in selecting their photos while lowering the burden of going through all their photos. our goal was to gain insights from the iterative humancentered design (hcd) process to both understand and inform the design of personal technology. we suggest that (a) carefully engaging users in the process of collecting data, (b) setting no explicit goals for users to achieve, and (c) providing minimal instructions to allow for creativity and playfulness, might promote broader adoption of personal technology by addressing some of the challenges and mental burden identified in other research [6, 18]. our findings led us to ask: how can we design personal technology to support users without limiting them to achieve specific goals? how would this be different from other applications that require achieving specific goals? we plan to conduct future research to investigate these questions as they also fit well within our larger study. we believe this project helped identify the connections between mindfulness, aesthetic needs, and aesthetic principles. we explored potential technologies that combine these three concepts. we also identified future research directions in developing new technologies to support mindfulness through the use of photos. given the growing popularity of photography, the omnipresence of smartphone cameras, and new applications such as instagram and snapchat, we believe there is potential for digital technology to leverage photography to support mindfulness while satisfying users’ needs for aesthetical experience.",96
Inspiring AWE: Transforming Clinic Waiting Rooms into Informal Learning Environments with Active Waiting Education,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656676,"this research explores patient education in pediatric hematology and oncology clinics. based on interviews, observations, and a review of existing patient materials, we argue that education in clinic waiting rooms is in need of reform. we applied design principles from research in science museums along with tangible interaction techniques to create the sickle cell station, an interactive learning experience about sickle cell disease. to evaluate the effectiveness of this design we observed approximately 580 participants in a pediatric hematology clinic waiting area in four different design conditions. these observations included detailed video analysis of 81 patients and their parents to understand their interaction and learning with the sickle cell station. our results show an engaging learning experience with relevant conversation, inquiry, and collaboration. we describe how patient engagement varied in the four design conditions and conclude with implications for new designs in the area of active waiting education (awe). waiting room education has had static form and progression for decades. museums, on the other hand, have spent years formulating designs and experiences that engage users, and are inviting and effective. we used the ape and flp learning standards in addition to montessori design concepts to create a station that plays to the waiting room community. the design aims to inspire patients’ intrinsic motivations to use their wait time to learn about relevant life-dependent issues. the vessel pulled in more users than any other form of material. with the exception of retention, all rates for the vessel show improvement over other material types - especially in regards to young children with average dwell times well over museum standards. we see inquiry and exploration, reading quietly and aloud, reading to answer questions, and reading because the poster is there, and commentary and explanations of the exhibit parts and their behaviors. users mapped the poster information to their work with the vessel and vice versa, tying in what they were reading to encourage their explorations. the conversations among participant groups were rich with biological content, covering blood composition, definitions of blood cells, clots, the heart beat, and blood transfusions to name a few. we heard many examples of personal associations, primarily relating the blood vessel to veins in the child’s own body, but also to friends with sickle cell and even chemotherapy. users demonstrated an understanding that sickle cells are stiff and that this causes blockages in the blood vessels. beyond the potential collaborations and learning experiences with the station, children enjoyed using it, showing verbal confirmations of fun, and dwell times well over the ape goals. naturalistic studies show substantial increases in interest from patients groups using interactive technologies for learning. interaction analysis show learning through inquiry, exploration, and collaboration with adults, children, family, and strangers that mimic those found in museum literature. this evidence supports the idea of active waiting education as a means to improve patient involvement in their own health education.",97
Object Manipulation in Virtual Reality Under Increasing Levels of Translational Gain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656677,"room-scale virtual reality (vr) has become an affordable consumer reality, with applications ranging from entertainment to productivity. however, the limited physical space available for room-scale vr in the typical home or office environment poses a significant problem. to solve this, physical spaces can be extended by amplifying the mapping of physical to virtual movement (translational gain). although amplified movement has been used since the earliest days of vr, little is known about how it influences reach-based interactions with virtual objects, now a standard feature of consumer vr. consequently, this paper explores the picking and placing of virtual objects in vr for the first time, with translational gains of between 1x (a one-to-one mapping of a 3.5m*3.5m virtual space to the same sized physical space) and 3x (10.5m*10.5m virtual mapped to 3.5m*3.5m physical). results show that reaching accuracy is maintained for up to 2x gain, however going beyond this diminishes accuracy and increases simulator sickness and perceived workload. we suggest gain levels of 1.5x to 1.75x can be utilized without compromising the usability of a vr task, significantly expanding the bounds of interactive room-scale vr. the physical space available for room-scale virtual reality (vr) is limited by common home or office spaces. utilising translational gain, the size of fully explorable virtual environments can be quickly and easily expanded with existing hardware. for the first time, this research has shown how these movement amplifications impact common object interactions such as reaching and picking. this paper has explored how the picking and placing of virtual objects in vr is affected by translational gains of up to 3.0x the physical movement. we found that reaching accuracy is maintained at up to 2x gain, however, going beyond this diminishes accuracy and increases simulator sickness and perceived workload. we have provided guidelines regarding how translational gain can be utilized by practitioners without compromising the vr user’s capability to interact with their virtual surroundings.",98
Watch Me Play: Does Social Facilitation Apply to Digital Games?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656678,"the presence of observers and virtual characters can significantly shape our gaming experience. researchers suppose that most of the basic socio-psychological phenomena are also applicable for digital games. however, the social processes in gaming setups can differ from our experience in other social situations. our work emphasizes that awareness. insights are needed for the purposeful design of a game's social setting, specifically in applied contexts of learning and training. here, we focus on the social facilitation effect, which describes an unconscious change in performance due to the presence of others, by investigating the impact of real observers and virtual agents on player experience and performance in four different games. the results of our four studies show that, in contrast to previous assumptions, in-game success was not significantly influenced by the presence of any social entity, indicating that social facilitation does not generally apply to the context of playing digital games. our four studies do not provide evidence for the effectiveness of social facilitation in the context of digital gaming. neither a virtual agent nor the presence of a co-located observer during play has significantly influenced the performance of players. although this finding is not generalizable to all kinds of gaming situations, we have discussed several reasons why the social facilitation effect is supposed to be less influential in most gaming scenarios compared to other social situations due to the special characteristics of digital games. these assumptions illustrate possible directions of future work in this area and will be addressed in follow-up studies. the different theoretical approaches to explain social facilitation (arousal, attention, social valuation) can be further illuminated by measuring the physiological arousal of players while facing different challenges, testing their level of distraction as well as their feeling of being evaluated. furthermore, the effect should be tested in other social settings with observers with different characteristics, which can be systematically varied according to the factors depicted in our model (see figure 1). our work contributes to the understanding of social processes in digital games and provide guidance for game designers and researchers who seek to take advantage of social effects like social facilitation in their games. this is particularly useful in applied areas like digital game-based learning. furthermore, our results demonstrate that the applicability of basic sociopsychological phenomena to digital games has to be proven before being used as rationale for game design decisions. otherwise, false assumptions regarding social effects may lead to game designs that induce unintended experiences or unwanted player behavior.",99
Do You Think What I Think: Perceptions of Delayed Instant Messages in Computer-Mediated Communication of Romantic Relations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656679,"in romantic relationships, instant messaging (im) can serve as a communication channel to maintain a sense of mutual presence and relational closeness when being physically separated. however, im is asynchronous by design. there can exist time delay for people to receive and reply to incoming messages, which may violate romantic partner's mutual expectation. limited understanding is available around how unintended and intended delays affect the relationship of romantic partners. this work examines how romantic partners grow, perceive, and use mutual knowledge about each other in delayed im to resolve the expectancy violation. we conducted a 7-day diary study on 16 pairs of romantic couples and used the diary entries as probes for post-study one-on-one interviews. our findings show that couples employ different strategies of information grounding to parse and resolve delayed im. based on these findings, we propose several theoretical and practical implications. in this paper, we explore grounding mechanisms between romantic couples in delayed im communication, and through the theoretical lens of expectancy violation theory. we conducted a 7-day diary study on 16 pairs of romantic couples and post one-on-one interviews. our findings show that couples employ different strategies of information grounding to parse and resolve delayed im, including status grounding, process grounding, and context grounding. different sources of grounding provide cues to resolve expectancy violations between romantic partners. based on our findings, we present research and design implications to understand and support romantic communication.",100
From Research to Practice: Informing the Design of Autism Support Smart Technology,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656670,"smart technologies (wearable and mobile devices) show tremendous potential in the detection, diagnosis, and management of autism spectrum disorder (asd) by enabling continuous real-time data collection, identifying effective treatment strategies, and supporting intervention design and delivery. though promising, effective utilization of smart technology in aiding asd is still limited. we propose a set of implications to guide the design of asd-support technology by analyzing 149 peer-reviewed articles focused on children with autism from acm digital library, ieee xplore, and pubmed. our analysis reveals that technology should facilitate real-time detection and identification of points-of-interest, adapt its behavior driven by the real-time affective state of the user, utilize familiar and unfamiliar features depending on user-context, and aid in revealing even minuscule progress made by children with autism. our findings indicate that such technology should strive to blend-in with everyday objects. moreover, gradual exposure and desensitization may facilitate successful adaptation of novel technology. we investigated how to design effective asd-support smart technologies for children. to uncover needs, challenges and opportunities, we conducted an extensive literature review on acm dl, ieee xplore, and pubmed. our findings indicate that smart technologies have been utilized to support different areas pertaining to asd - early detection of autism, gaze and facial expression recognition and understanding, affect detection, identifying and managing repetitive and stereotypical behavior, and improving social, educational, and learning skills. despite this wide coverage of clinical challenges unique to asd, we believe smart technologies are still under-utilized. specifically, such technologies were rarely used for continuous real-time data collection, monitoring, and intervention, in the natural environment and/or for longer periods. we also found that at present asd-research is primarily conducted in the developed countries. as autism is a global phenomenon and developing countries lack advanced technologies and trained professionals [96, 134], we argue that developing countries deserve the same, if not more, attention from the asd research community. we propose a set of actionable guidelines collectively drawing from our findings, research on assistive technology design, and our experience of working with related stakeholders. we believe that to be effective, smart technologies should facilitate real-time collection, detection, and identification of events-of-interest such as the beginning of a lapse episode or distress triggered by a specific context. these technologies should be capable of adapting their behavior in real-time based on user’s preference, affective state, and user and environmental context. smart technologies should also act as analytical tools, facilitating capture, detection, and highlighting even small progress made by children with autism. we argue that to be effective, smart technologies need to be inconspicuous and low-burden. we believe that our findings and insights would lead to better asd-support smart technologies.",101
Explanations as Mechanisms for Supporting Algorithmic Transparency,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656671,"transparency can empower users to make informed choices about how they use an algorithmic decision-making system and judge its potential consequences. however, transparency is often conceptualized by the outcomes it is intended to bring about, not the specifics of mechanisms to achieve those outcomes. we conducted an online experiment focusing on how different ways of explaining facebook's news feed algorithm might affect participants' beliefs and judgments about the news feed. we found that all explanations caused participants to become more aware of how the system works, and helped them to determine whether the system is biased and if they can control what they see. the explanations were less effective for helping participants evaluate the correctness of the system's output, and form opinions about how sensible and consistent its behavior is. we present implications for the design of transparency mechanisms in algorithmic decision-making systems based on these results.",102
On the Design of OLO Radio: Investigating Metadata as a Design Material,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656672,"with the massive adoption of music streaming services globally, metadata is being generated that captures people's music listening histories in more precise detail than ever before. these metadata archives offer a valuable and overlooked resource for designing new ways of supporting people in experiencing the music they have listened to over the course of their lives. yet, little research has demonstrated how metadata can be applied as a material in design practice. we describe the design of olo radio, a device that leverages music listening history metadata to support experiences of exploring and living with music from one's past. we unpack and reflect on design choices that made use of the exacting precision captured in listening history metadata archives to support relatively imprecise qualities of feedback and interaction to encourage rich, open-ended experiences of contemplation, curiosity, and enjoyment over time. we conclude with implications for hci research and practice in this space. through grounding our research in the creation of a highly finished design artifact, our work contributes concrete insights into a design approach that responds to growing calls in hci to design technologies capable of: (i) sustaining longer-term experiences [19,33], (ii) opening new possibilities for forming relations to our personal data in everyday life [8,51], and (iii) expressing more diverse perspectives on temporality through design [32,44,54]. insights from our design process revealed the practical need for richer, more expressive tools to support interaction designers in making use of metadata archives as a design material early in the exploratory stages of the design process. our work also suggests opportunities for future hci research to design new ways of temporally organizing, manifesting, and engaging with other forms of personal content and their attendant metadata (e.g., photos, video, digital messages, etc.) in everyday life. beyond personally generated content, this approach could equally help extend nascent and growing design efforts exploring how dynamic ready-made data (e.g., related to climate [26], seismic [47], or transportation patterns [16]) could be meaningfully situated in people’s everyday lives over time. importantly, our aim is not to be prescriptive or conclusive. rather, we intend to unpack the olo radio design artifact in the service of inspiring and framing future designoriented work inquiring into the role, place, and pace of digital data in everyday life. in our future work, we aim to produce low-volume productions of olo radio to explore people’s experiences with it over time in their everyday lives. on a broader level, we hope that our detailed unpacking the design of olo radio and discussion of the resulting implications can be appreciated as an effort to better support design-oriented forms of knowledge production in the hci community.",103
"Engage Early, Correct More: How Journalists Participate in False Rumors Online during Crisis Events",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656673,"journalists are struggling to adapt to new conditions of news production and simultaneously encountering criticism for their role in spreading misinformation. against the backdrop of this ""crisis in journalism"", this research seeks to understand how journalists are actually participating in the spread and correction of online rumors. we compare the engagement behaviors of journalists to non-journalists- and specifically other high visibility users-within five false rumors that spread on twitter during three crisis events. our findings show journalists engaging earlier than non-journalists in the spread and the correction of false rumors. however, compared to other users, journalists are (proportionally) more likely to deny false rumors. journalists are also more likely to author original tweets and to be retweeted-underscoring their continued role in shaping the news. interestingly, journalists scored high on ""power user"" measures, but were distinct from other power users in significant ways-e.g. by being more likely to deny rumors. in this research, we compare the rumoring behaviors of journalists and non-journalists. our analyses revealed that journalists and non-journalists differ in terms of the content they produce, their propensity to correct false rumors, and their temporal patterns of participation. journalists produced significantly more original tweets than non-journalists. journalists were more likely to deny a false rumor, an effect that held up even when we controlled for power user status. journalists also tended to engage in both affirming and denying a rumor earlier than other users. these findings suggest that journalists remain a distinct professional community of practice within the social media crowd. though we did not find consistent evidence to support journalists utilizing the “publish first, then correct” strategy (or the more traditional “confirm first, then publish” one), when compared with other users we did see an “engage earlier, correct more” strategy. these findings demonstrate journalists both struggling to adapt to the new conditions of real-time news reporting and continuing to serve a distinguished role in reporting breaking news and helping to correct misinformation.",104
Measuring the “Why” of Interaction: Development and Validation of the User Motivation Inventory (UMI),https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656674,"motivation is a fundamental concept in understanding people's experiences and behavior. yet, motivation to engage with an interactive system has received only limited attention in hci. we report the development and validation of the user motivation inventory (umi). the umi is an 18-item multidimensional measure of motivation, rooted in self-determination theory (sdt). it is designed to measure intrinsic motivation, integrated, identified, introjected, and external regulation, as well as amotivation. results of two studies (total n = 941) confirm the six-factor structure of the umi with high reliability, as well as convergent and discriminant validity of each subscale. relationships with core concepts such as need satisfaction, vitality, and usability were studied. additionally, the umi was found to detect differences in motivation for people who consider abandoning a technology compared to those who do not question their use. the central role of motivation in users' behavior and experience is discussed. we present the development and validation of a multidimensional measurement tool rooted in self-determination theory that helps to deepen our understanding of why users interact with a technology. the development and validation followed best practices and all data collected in the two studies together with the materials and analysis code is available online. the umi has been tested with over 900 participants and shows promising psychometric properties, high reliability, convergent and discriminant validity. the umi has implications for theory and practice and opens up opportunities for future research on motivation and user experience.",105
GestureWiz: A Human-Powered Gesture Design Environment for User Interface Prototypes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656685,"designers and researchers often rely on simple gesture recognizers like wobbrock et al.'s $1 for rapid user interface prototypes. however, most existing recognizers are limited to a particular input modality and/or pre-trained set of gestures, and cannot be easily combined with other recognizers. in particular, creating prototypes that employ advanced touch and mid-air gestures still requires significant technical experience and programming skill. inspired by $1's easy, cheap, and flexible design, we present the gesturewiz prototyping environment that provides designers with an integrated solution for gesture definition, conflict checking, and real-time recognition by employing human recognizers in a wizard of oz manner. we present a series of experiments with designers and crowds to show that gesturewiz can perform with reasonable accuracy and latency. we demonstrate advantages of gesturewiz when recreating gesture-based interfaces from the literature and conducting a study with 12 interaction designers that prototyped a multimodal interface with support for a wide range of novel gestures in about 45 minutes. we have presented the gesturewiz prototyping environment that provides designers with an integrated solution for gesture definition, conflict checking, and recognition in nearly realtime using wizard of oz or crowdsourcing set-ups. informed by initial experiments with crowd workers, we developed optimized interfaces for requesters and workers and suitable strategies for recognition. to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, we prototyped and tested three applications featuring different input modalities and kinds of gestures, which would typically require multiple gesture recognition libraries and significant programming skills. an explorative study with 12 interaction designers revealed benefits and limitations of our approach. participants generally appreciated the possibility to quickly and easily define and test new gestures, as well as the integrated conflict resolution functionality and enjoyed using gesturewiz. all of the interaction designers, in pairs of two, were able to create and test gesture sets from scratch and have them recognized by a woz and crowd workers in about 45 minutes. code and data are available at https://github.com/mi2lab/gesturewiz. our larger vision behind this work is to enable interactive surfaces and spaces anytime, anywhere. gesturewiz provides an important first step towards this vision. it is now possible to walk into an interactive room, experiment with different kinds of non-trivial gestures and test them on the spot, without having to write a single line of gesture recognition code. in the future, it will be interesting to formalize the gesture definition and recognition approach using crowds to support guessability studies while enabling quick testing and revision using gesturewiz. on the crowdsourcing side, future work needs to investigate how to mitigate the shortcomings related to accuracy and latency that were revealed during the user study. another direction of work we intend to address is making use of the data provided by woz and crowds to automatically train corresponding machine learning models, thus facilitating recognition after the prototyping stage.",106
In Search of the Dream Team: Temporally Constrained Multi-Armed Bandits for Identifying Effective Team Structures,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656686,"team structures---roles, norms, and interaction patterns---define how teams work. hci researchers have theorized ideal team structures and built systems nudging teams towards them, such as those increasing turn-taking, deliberation, and knowledge distribution. however, organizational behavior research argues against the existence of universally ideal structures. teams are diverse and excel under different structures: while one team might flourish under hierarchical leadership and a critical culture, another will flounder. in this paper, we present dreamteam: a system that explores a large space of possible team structures to identify effective structures for each team based on observable feedback. to avoid overwhelming teams with too many changes, dreamteam introduces multi-armed bandits with temporal constraints: an algorithm that manages the timing of exploration--exploitation trade-offs across multiple bandits simultaneously. a field experiment demonstrated that dreamteam teams outperformed self-managing teams by 38%, manager-led teams by 46%, and teams with unconstrained bandits by 41%. this research advances computation as a powerful partner in establishing effective teamwork. effective teamwork is a wicked problem [48]: it cannot be planned in advance, and requires adaptation to the people, task, and environment. prior work focused on pre-selecting effective structures, such as convening the right members or using the right collaborative system. acknowledging that this correct identification is impossible in the limit, we introduce a system that helps teams adaptively identify a set of roles, norms, and interaction patterns that is effective for them. to enable dreamteam, we contribute a model for multi-armed bandits with temporal constraints, which ensures that these structures evolve at a feasible pace and at the right period in a team’s overall arc. evidence from our evaluation suggests that teams using dreamteam can be far more effective than existing modes of organizing for these rapidly convened teams. we envision computation as a partner in helping groups achieve their goals. it can aid us when we exhibit biases or limited self-knowledge—such as identifying effective team structures—and it will help us re-plan when the environment shifts. dreamteam represents a step toward this future of computationally augmented teams and organizations.",107
Troubling Vulnerability: Designing with LGBT Young People's Ambivalence Towards Hate Crime Reporting,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656687,"hci is increasingly working with 'vulnerable' people, yet there is a danger that the label of vulnerability can alienate and stigmatize the people such work aims to support. we report our study investigating the application of interaction design to increase rates of hate crime reporting amongst lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people. during design-led workshops, participants expressed ambivalence towards reporting. while recognizing their exposure to hate crime, they simultaneously rejected being identified as victim as implied in the act of reporting. we used visual communication design to depict the young people's ambivalent identities and contribute insights into how these fail and succeed to account for the intersectional, fluid and emergent nature of lgbt identities through the design research process. we argue that by producing ambiguously designed texts alongside conventional outcomes, we 'trouble' our design research narratives as a tactic to disrupt static and reductive understandings of vulnerability within hci. making space for stories of experiences of hate crime and resilience to circulate is one of the ways in which design research can support vulnerable people [46]. however, there is a need for reflexive awareness of our role in shaping such stories and a need to actively work to disrupt narratives that cast participants as passive victims [29]. as we learnt from our experience presenting our research at a pride event, it is easy for research accounts to become static clichés that close down meaning making, and so the troubling of narratives needs to be an ongoing process. ambiguity is often cited as a resource for design within hci and design research [22], but its role in design research has been less clearly defined. in the context of this project, we found that ambiguity was a resource for an ongoing ‘troubling’ of artefacts, narratives and identities which emerged from the research process. it forces us to be engaged with reflexivity, not as a one-time declaration of our positions, but an on-going practice of looking hard at oneself and listening carefully to others. it draws our attention to the edges and outliers of our data, but, perhaps most importantly, opens up space from which new meanings and understandings can emerge.",108
PHUI-kit: Interface Layout and Fabrication on Curved 3D Printed Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656688,"we seek to make physical user interface (phui) design more like graphical user interface (gui) design by using a drag-and drop interface to place widgets, allowing widgets to be repositioned and by hiding implementation details. phuis are interfaces built from tangible widgets arranged on the surfaces of physical objects. phui layout will become more important as we move from rectangular screens to purpose-built interactive devices. approaches to phui layout based on sculpture make it difficult to reposition widgets, and software approaches do not involve placing widgets on the device exterior. we created phui-kit, a software approach to phui layout on 3d printed enclosures, which has a drag-and-drop interface, supports repositioning of widgets, and hides implementation details. we describe algorithms for placing widgets on curved surfaces, modifying the enclosure geometry, and routing wiring inside the enclosure. the tool is easy to use and supports a wide range of design possibilities. making phui layout more like gui layout on physical interfaces(3d models) will likely lead ta a better set of interface design tools. better interface design tools may accelerate the creation of physical interactive devices which do not look like rectangular boxes with screens as found in cellphones and tablets. curved elements are prominent in physical devices and phui works well with curved geometry. we have identified core problems associated with this approach and proposed a set of solutions. future work might explore different approaches to the core problems we supported only basic operations of interface layout such as place, move, rotate and delete. additional work will be needed to support more complex operations such as aligning a group of widgets and scaling the interface in response to changing the cuvature or size of the enclosure.",109
Crowd-Guided Ensembles: How Can We Choreograph Crowd Workers for Video Segmentation?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656689,"in this work, we propose two ensemble methods leveraging a crowd workforce to improve video annotation, with a focus on video object segmentation. their shared principle is that while individual candidate results may likely be insufficient, they often complement each other so that they can be combined into something better than any of the individual results---the very spirit of collaborative working. for one, we extend a standard polygon-drawing interface to allow workers to annotate negative space, and combine the work of multiple workers instead of relying on a single best one as commonly done in crowdsourced image segmentation. for the other, we present a method to combine multiple automatic propagation algorithms with the help of the crowd. such combination requires an understanding of where the algorithms fail, which we gather using a novel coarse scribble video annotation task. we evaluate our ensemble methods, discuss our design choices for them, and make our web-based crowdsourcing tools and results publicly available. we introduced two novel crowd-guided ensemble methods that combine multiple inputs from the crowd as well as automated algorithms to generate final segmentations that are better than any of their individual components. first, our results show that we can acquire image segmentations of higher quality by combining the work of multiple individuals. they confirm that negative polygon annotations are effective for crowdsourced segmentation. they also show that using our scribble-based ensemble method, we can delegate the review process of our oracle to the crowd to a certain extent. in practice, the oracle may well be required because rotoscoping work is often tied to some artistic decision that requires human validation. on the propagation side, our scribble-based ensembles are promising given their flexibility and the potential quality increase over naive ensembles, although they do not achieve cost efficiency compared to increase segmentation rates. finally, the web interfaces, tools, and data of our experiments will be made public for future research.",110
Phone vs. Tangible in Museums: A Comparative Study,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656680,"despite years of hci research on digital technology in museums, it is still unclear how different interactions impact on visitors'. a comparative evaluation of smart replicas, phone app and smart cards looked at the personal preferences, behavioural change, and the appeal of mobiles in museums. 76 participants used all three interaction modes and gave their opinions in a questionnaire; participants interaction was also observed. the results show the phone is the most disliked interaction mode while tangible interaction (smart card and replica combined) is the most liked. preference for the phone favour mobility to the detriment of engagement with the exhibition. different behaviours when interacting with the phone or the tangibles where observed. the personal visiting style appeared to be only marginally affected by the device. visitors also expect museums to provide the phones against the current trend of developing apps in a ""bring your own device"" approach. in conclusion, our study showed the limited effect of the interaction mode on the visiting behaviour and preferences. instead it highlights the importance of the personal attitude and visiting style. key to appreciation and engagement is the match between the personal visiting style and the interaction that better affords that style. our findings offer museum professionals, exhibition designers and interaction designers evidence that multiple options are possible and how they affect visitors. finally, we provide researchers working on tangible interaction in museums with some important elements that can help explain why some people do not engage with the design as expected, e.g. not all visiting style appreciate the form of “forced” engagement proposed by tangibles.",111
Evaluating User Satisfaction with Typography Designs via Mining Touch Interaction Data in Mobile Reading,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656681,"previous work has demonstrated that typography design has a great influence on users' reading experience. however, current typography design guidelines are mainly for general purpose, while the individual needs are nearly ignored. to achieve personalized typography designs, an important and necessary step is accurately evaluating user satisfaction with the typography designs. current evaluation approaches, e.g., asking for users' opinions directly, however, interrupt the reading and affect users' judgments. in this paper, we propose a novel method to address this challenge by mining users' implicit feedbacks, e.g., touch interaction data. we conduct two mobile reading studies in chinese to collect the touch interaction data from 91 participants. we propose various features based on our three hypotheses to capture meaningful patterns in the touch behaviors. the experiment results show the effectiveness of our evaluation models with higher accuracy on comparing with the baseline under three text difficulty levels, respectively. as the first step to provide personalized typography designs, evaluating user satisfaction without interrupting reading is still a challenge for designers. in this study, we conduct two reading studies and demonstrate that users’ touch behaviors in reading can reflect their satisfaction with the typography design. we also find out text difficulty has an influence on the touch behaviors. the results show that evaluation models based on our features lead to higher accuracy than the baseline.",112
"Keeping a Low Profile?: Technology, Risk and Privacy among Undocumented Immigrants",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656682,"undocumented immigrants in the united states face risks of discrimination, surveillance, and deportation. we investigate their technology use, risk perceptions, and protective strategies relating to their vulnerability. through semi-structured interviews with latinx undocumented immigrants, we find that while participants act to address offline threats, this vigilance does not translate to their online activities. their technology use is shaped by needs and benefits rather than risk perceptions. while our participants are concerned about identity theft and privacy generally, and some raise concerns about online harassment, their understanding of government surveillance risks is vague and met with resignation. we identify tensions among self-expression, group privacy, and self-censorship related to their immigration status, as well as strong trust in service providers. our findings have implications for digital literacy education, privacy and security interfaces, and technology design in general. even minor design decisions can substantially affect exposure risks and well-being for such vulnerable communities. for undocumented immigrants living in the united states, typical struggles of immigration and integration are exacerbated by a fear of discovery and deportation. how undocumented immigrants perceive and manage status-related risks in technology use has not been well understood previously. through our interviews with 17 latinx undocumented immigrants, we provide insights into this community’s technology use practices, risk perceptions and protective strategies. we find that many struggle to translate awareness and risk mitigation strategies they employ in the physical world to technology use and the online environment. due to uncertain risks of various kinds, including surveillance and a sense that the government knows a lot about them already, many do not fully consider how their behavior online may affect risks of discovery. for others, technology use is associated with tensions among convenience, intimate engagement, self-disclosure, self-censorship and community participation. furthermore, we find latent yet uncertain concerns about what others in their network might inadvertently reveal about them. these tensions and boundary turbulences create stress that may affect the well-being of themselves and their families. our findings demonstrate an opportunity for the design and provision of educational resources, and the design of transparency and privacy mechanisms. community organizations, such as schools or churches, as well as service providers, such as facebook, also have an important role to play in mitigating, or potentially exacerbating, risks from technology use for the undocumented immigrant community and vulnerable communities more broadly.",113
Comparing Computer-Based Drawing Methods for Blind People with Real-Time Tactile Feedback,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656683,"in this paper, we present a drawing workstation for blind people using a two-dimensional tactile pin-matrix display for in- and output. four different input modalities, namely menu-based, gesture-based, freehand-stylus and a time-of-flight (tof) depth segmentation of real-world object silhouettes, are utilized to create graphical shapes. users can freely manipulate shapes after creation. twelve blind users evaluated and compared the four image creation modalities. during evaluation, participants had to copy four different images. the results show that all modalities are highly appropriate for non-visual drawing tasks. there is no generally preferred drawing modality, but most participants rated the robust and well-known menu-based interaction as very good. furthermore, menu was second in performance and the most accurate drawing modality. our evaluation demonstrated direct manipulation works well for blind users at the position of the reading hand. in general, our drawing tool allows blind users to create appealing images. in this paper, we have presented a powerful drawing workstation for blind users with real-time tactile feedback. within our evaluation, we enabled blind users to draw accurate images. the used input modality was effecting the quality of the result but not the satisfaction felt by the user. none of the offered drawing modalities was preferred in general, but we saw that visually impaired users often rated the reliable, robust and well-known menu modality as one of their favorites. the participants stated out, that they would prefer a combination of different modalities, choosing that one that suites best for the current needs. however, only a few users would accept the additional technical equipment and effort for searching a suitable object for drawing by camera-based object segmentation. the results show that the human factor has a high influence on the tools that people like to use, especially when it comes to creativity tasks. of course, the evaluation design does not give the two free form creation methods (freehand stylus and object segmentation) the chance to shine. drawings with more complex figures or real-world objects could enable these methods to outperform the conservative methods (menu and gestures). our workstation is designed to allow the user to draw and interact with any kind of black and white images. however, this advantage in flexibility leads to the lack of automation in creating specific kinds of graphics (e. g. diagrams). compared to more specialized tools, in our workstation the user must compose his/her image from standard or free form shapes. our system is best suited for creativity tasks as well as cooperation with sighted people (e. g. presenting ideas graphically). our evaluation demonstrated that direct manipulation works well for blind users at the position of the reading hand, but not far beyond the current region of interest. a better understanding of the mental model related to operations along symmetry axes pertinent to shapes is needed. referring the list of requirements and recommendations for digital drawing tools for blind people from [9], the crucial requirements named (1) tactile feedback, (2) error correction methods and (4) sharing the resulting images are met. the next step is to check our system against the whole list of requirements, including (3) compatibility with common at. based on the evaluation results, it became clear that blind users want to have even more drawing support than what is offered yet. for instance, they want to have more predefined shapes in the menu and gesture drawing modality, such as different kinds of triangles, polygons, circle segments or complex figures. more predefined shape palettes lead to more complex menus, making the search for the desired shape even more time-consuming. to counteract this problem, additional speech input could support usability. we saw that drawing freehand figures is a hard task, especially for congenitally blind users. we all know how hard it is to draw a complex shape in a single stroke. as kamel and landay [21] noticed, connecting two lines exactly to each other is one of the main problematic tasks while drawing. therefore, the support for drawing complex shapes by connecting different subparts to each other is the next important feature to offer. in general, users often criticized the fact that vectorized shapes lack in straight edges and sharp corners. to overcome this problem it is possible to add shape recognition functionality to detect standard shapes in freehand sketches or segmented objects like other sketching systems do.",114
Enabling People with Visual Impairments to Navigate Virtual Reality with a Haptic and Auditory Cane Simulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656684,"traditional virtual reality (vr) mainly focuses on visual feedback, which is not accessible for people with visual impairments. we created canetroller, a haptic cane controller that simulates white cane interactions, enabling people with visual impairments to navigate a virtual environment by transferring their cane skills into the virtual world. canetroller provides three types of feedback: (1) physical resistance generated by a wearable programmable brake mechanism that physically impedes the controller when the virtual cane comes in contact with a virtual object; (2) vibrotactile feedback that simulates the vibrations when a cane hits an object or touches and drags across various surfaces; and (3) spatial 3d auditory feedback simulating the sound of real-world cane interactions. we designed indoor and outdoor vr scenes to evaluate the effectiveness of our controller. our study showed that canetroller was a promising tool that enabled visually impaired participants to navigate different virtual spaces. we discuss potential applications supported by canetroller ranging from entertainment to mobility training. in this paper, we presented canetroller, a haptic controller that simulates white cane interactions, enabling people with visual impairments to navigate a virtual environment by transferring their cane skills into the virtual world. we started with a formative study to understand vips’ cane strategies, and distilled implications to guide the design of canetroller. we also evaluated the effectiveness of canetroller with indoor and outdoor virtual scenarios, showing it to be a promising tool to enable visually impaired users to explore and navigate the virtual world. canetroller has potential in different areas, such as entertainment, o&m training, and environment preparation. we hope our work can inspire researchers and designers to design more effective tools to make vr more inclusive.",115

Exploring New Metaphors for a Networked World through the File Biography,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656696,"we present a body of work undertaken in response to the challenge outlined by harper et al. in their paper, ?'what is a file?' [9]. through a conceptual and design-led exploration of new file metaphors, we developed the 'file biography', a digital entity that encompasses the provenance of a file and allows the user to keep track of how it propagates. we explored this through prototyping and utilised it in two user studies. in the studies, we (i) asked people to sketch out file biographies for their own content, and (ii) deployed a tool enabling users to build their own simple file biographies across multiple versions of word documents. we conclude that new file metaphors may need to play different roles for different types of digital content, with a distinction being drawn between content that is 'in production' and virtual possessions that are, in a sense, a 'finished' artefact. the question of how to design new file metaphors for a networked world is challenging to address. in this paper, we have outlined our approach, which combines research through design, development, and with users, to explore this problem space. our work centres on the file biography, used as an analytic tool to ground prototyping and interviews with users. our research has led us to reflect on how new file metaphors can work across components that are stored in different places or that represent different points in time. it has also pushed us to consider how metaphors might play different roles in different contexts, with a distinction being drawn between content that is ‘in production’ and virtual possessions that are, in some sense, a finished form. we argue that these different lenses require different emphases when developing a new grammar of action; while the former might be bound up with ways of syncing content that enables work to be done in private, the latter might be bound up with more nuanced models of sharing and ownership.",117
Understanding Older Users' Acceptance of Wearable Interfaces for Sensor-based Fall Risk Assessment,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656697,"algorithms processing data from wearable sensors promise to more accurately predict risks of falling -- a significant concern for older adults. substantial engineering work is dedicated to increasing the prediction accuracy of these algorithms; yet fewer efforts are dedicated to better engaging users through interactive visualizations in decision-making using these data. we present an investigation of the acceptance of a sensor-based fall risk assessment wearable device. a participatory design was employed to develop a mobile interface providing visualizations of sensor data and algorithmic assessments of fall risks. we then investigated the acceptance of this interface and its potential to motivate behavioural changes through a field deployment, which suggested that the interface and its belt-mounted wearable sensors are perceived as usable. we also found that providing contextual information for fall risk estimation combined with relevant practical fall prevention instructions may facilitate the acceptance of such technologies, potentially leading to behaviour change. our survey and interview results showed that overall the sfra system implemented in this study achieved high user acceptance (hypothesis h1), and participants consider the fall risk estimation useful and the accessibility is appreciated. participants have also indicated they are more aware of the risk of falling from this experience (hypothesis h2), and they also believe this information can motivate them to adopt fall prevention interventions. with the simulated high risk data, we also found that older users consider fall risk estimation more useful when the fall risk is high, and they have also pointed out the value of estimation is limited when the fall risk is low. this highlights the importance of attaching contextual information to the estimation data to help users interpret and understand their situations better, thus providing more values in the information to keep users engaged. furthermore, it is necessary to provide specific instructions in the case of high risk, in order to guide the older user to take most appropriate actions while they are motivated to improve their situation. in addition, any misconception of technology must be carefully addressed as it could lead to risk-taking behaviours. lastly, feedback from field evaluation were collected regarding features suggested through participatory design, leading to recommendations on improving the design of mobile uis for sfra systems.",118
How People Form Folk Theories of Social Media Feeds and What it Means for How We Study Self-Presentation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656698,"self-presentation is a process that is significantly complicated by the rise of algorithmic social media feeds, which obscure information about one's audience and environment. user understandings of these systems, and therefore user ability to adapt to them, are limited, and have recently been explored through the lens of folk theories. to date, little is understood of how these theories are formed, and how they tie to the self-presentation process in social media. this paper presents an exploratory look at the folk theory formation process and the interplay between folk theories and self-presentation via a 28-participant interview study. results suggest that people draw from diverse sources of information when forming folk theories, and that folk theories are more complex, multifaceted and malleable than previously assumed. this highlights the need to integrate folk theories into both social media systems and theories of self-presentation. in this paper, we have taken the first steps in understanding the folk theory formation process as it applies to algorithmic social media feeds, and provided a preliminary conceptual toolkit for integrating this important process into modern models of self-presentation. these contributions provide guidance to designers on how to aid social media users in fulfilling their presentation goals in a complex, algorithmic online world.",119
Analogy Mining for Specific Design Needs,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656699,"finding analogical inspirations in distant domains is a powerful way of solving problems. however, as the number of inspirations that could be matched and the dimensions on which that matching could occur grow, it becomes challenging for designers to find inspirations relevant to their needs. furthermore, designers are often interested in exploring specific aspects of a product-- for example, one designer might be interested in improving the brewing capability of an outdoor coffee maker, while another might wish to optimize for portability. in this paper we introduce a novel system for targeting analogical search for specific needs. specifically, we contribute an analogical search engine for expressing and abstracting specific design needs that returns more distant yet relevant inspirations than alternate approaches. in this paper, we contribute a novel system for tuning analogical search for specific design needs, consisting of an interface for designers to express their specific needs in abstract terms, and an analogy search engine that uses this focus-abstracted query to find inspirations from a corpus that are both relevant and domain-distant. this work contributes a novel path forward to computational support for mining large databases of potential inspirations on the web to improve design work.",120
Measuring Employment Demand Using Internet Search Data,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656690,"we are in a transitional economic period emphasizing automation of physical jobs and the shift towards intellectual labor. how can we measure and understand human behaviors of job search, and how communities are adapting to these changes? we use internet search data to estimate employment demand in the united states. starting with 225 million raw job search queries in 2015 and 2016 from a popular search engine, we classify queries into one of 15 fields of employment with accuracy and f-1 of 97%, and use the resulting query volumes to estimate per-sector employment demand in u.s. counties. we validate against bureau of labor statistics measures, and then demonstrate benefits for communities, showing significant differences in the types of jobs searched for across socio-economic dimensions like poverty and education level. we discuss implications for macroeconomic measurement, as well as how community leaders, policy makers, and the field of hci can benefit. in this paper, we proposed a new measure of job search trends called employment demand that captures the demands individuals have while searching for a job. we used 225 million search queries in 2015 and 2016 from bing to map and explore trends in employment demand. we developed a classification system that labels these search queries into one of 15 categories of job search that performs with .97 f1. we validated our measure by showing expected correlations with changes in monthly non-farm payrolls, and across geographies by showing relationships to demographic characteristics of u.s. counties such as population size, existing labor force measures, and socio-economic measures. we believe that employment demand can be used to explore many community, policy, and economic trends, and encourage hci to engage in research around gainful employment.",121
Data Illustrator: Augmenting Vector Design Tools with Lazy Data Binding for Expressive Visualization Authoring,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656691,"building graphical user interfaces for visualization authoring is challenging as one must reconcile the tension between flexible graphics manipulation and procedural visualization generation based on a graphical grammar or declarative languages. to better support designers' workflows and practices, we propose data illustrator, a novel visualization framework. in our approach, all visualizations are initially vector graphics; data binding is applied when necessary and only constrains interactive manipulation to that data bound property. the framework augments graphic design tools with new concepts and operators, and describes the structure and generation of a variety of visualizations. based on the framework, we design and implement a visualization authoring system. the system extends interaction techniques in modern vector design tools for direct manipulation of visualization configurations and parameters. we demonstrate the expressive power of our approach through a variety of examples. a qualitative study shows that designers can use our framework to compose visualizations. we present a novel framework that describes the generation of visualizations from the perspective of graphic design. based on the framework, we design and build data illustrator, a system that augments vector design tools with lazy data binding for visualization authoring. we demonstrate the expressivity of our approach through visualization examples. a study with 13 designers shows that the system is learnable and designers can use the framework to compose visualizations. the data illustrator system is available at http://www.data-illustrator.com. the framework we created provides descriptive and generative power for visualization design, but in its current form, it is not complete. the framework needs to be expanded to include area as a shape primitive, so that it can describe visualizations such as area charts and stream graphs. further research is also necessary to include the support for hierarchical, network and geographic data, and the corresponding visualizations. in terms of implementation, data illustrator demonstrates the feasibility and power of a subset of the framework. layouts such as packing and polar coordinate positioning are not yet supported in the system. we also need to implement ring as a shape primitive for creating donut charts. finally, systems such as lyra build on top of vega, which have access to the functionalities offered by d3 , including interpolation methods for lines and curves. data illustrator should provide those capabilities in order to be more powerful. for future work, we would also like to explore how to turn visualization designs into reusable templates. once users create a visualization inside data illustrator, they should be able to export it into formats readable by other tools and to share it with other users, who can customize the design with their own data and visual styles. adding authoring support for interactivity is also a direction to investigate further.",122
Safety vs. Surveillance: What Children Have to Say about Mobile Apps for Parental Control,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656692,"mobile applications (""apps"") developed to promote online safety for children are underutilized and rely heavily on parental control features that monitor and restrict their child's mobile activities. this asymmetry in parental surveillance initiates an interesting research question -- how do children themselves feel about such parental control apps? we conducted a qualitative analysis of 736 reviews of 37 mobile online safety apps from google play that were publicly posted and written by children (ages 8-19). our results indicate that child ratings were significantly lower than that of parents with 76% of the child reviews giving apps a single star. children felt that the apps were overly restrictive and invasive of their personal privacy, negatively impacting their relationships with their parents. we relate these findings with hci literature on mobile online safety, including broader literature around privacy and surveillance, and outline design opportunities for online safety apps. mobile technologies should support children in their developmental goals, including information-seeking, learning about rules and boundaries, and maintaining social relationships [7], in addition to keeping them safe from online risks. however, this goal will only be accomplished once designers listen more intently to children as end users. in the results presented in this paper, we chose to use a purely descriptive approach to present the key themes and unfiltered quotes from the child users. our goal in doing this was to provide a non-judgmental account of what children had to say in their reviews. to conclude, however, we use a more interpretive lens to reflect on our results. we observed a lot of frustration and anger in the child comments. thus, it is possible that the reviews may have been overly biased toward negative impressions of the apps in an angered attempt to retaliate against their parents. however, the direct quotes from the child reviews actually illustrated a rather surprising level of maturity, selfawareness, and reason that researchers do not typically capture when viewing children through the eyes of adults. children in our study wanted their parents to give them more freedom, a chance to prove they can make good online choices, and space to make some mistakes. they were not upset that online safety apps prevent them from risk-seeking behaviors; they were mad that they prevented them from doing other useful tasks. children liked features within apps that helped them with problematic behavior but gave them some level of control, or at least gave them a way to negotiate or compromise with their parents regarding rules and restrictions. given this sociotechnical gap, children provided well-articulated and honest commentary around how these apps did not reinforce positive parenting practices and, based on the literature [62], they were right. these beneficial features are clearly under-supported within the existing app offerings [63]. thus, our conclusion here was that we (as researchers, designers, and parents) might want to consider turning the critical lens around to look at ourselves and understand the negative biases we may hold about children when trying to keep them safe online.",123
Co-performance: Conceptualizing the Role of Artificial Agency in the Design of Everyday Life,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656693,"this paper introduces the notion of co-performance, with the aim to offer human-computer interaction (hci) researchers and practitioners a new perspective on the role of artificial agency in everyday life, from automated systems to autonomous devices. in contrast to 'smartness,' which focuses on a supposed autonomy of artifacts, co-performance considers artifacts as capable of learning and performing next to people. this shifts the locus of design from matters of distributions of agency at design time, to matters of embodied learning in everyday practice for both human and artificial performers. from this perspective, co-performance acknowledges the dynamic differences in capabilities between humans and artifacts, and highlights the fundamentally recursive relation between professional design and use. implications for hci design practice are unpacked through reflections on smart thermostat design in light of historic changes in roles between humans and heating systems, and changing ideas of appropriateness in everyday practices of domestic heating. in this paper we have introduced the concept of coperformance as a novel perspective on the role of artificial agency in everyday life. interest in what is often referred to as smart and autonomous devices, and more recently embedded artificial intelligence, has grown in hci. increased proliferation of such computational artefacts in the messy and unpredictable settings of everyday life, however, poses significant challenges. to address these challenges, we have reflected on smart thermostat design. we have done so from the perspective of historic changes in both human and artificial performances and roles, in relation to the social practice of domestic heating. through the links that can be made between changes in ideas of appropriate indoor climates, we have unpacked the main tenets of co-performance and offered the beginnings of a new research agenda. considering the interplay between humans and artefacts in everyday life is not new, but linking it to the conceptual framework of social theories of practice in hci allows to conceptualize the relations between people and artefacts in a wider context, which includes the relation between everyday use and professional practices of technology development. co-performance opens new avenues for hci researchers and designers to (1) develop richer accounts of the dynamic role of computational artefacts in everyday life, and by implications related design practices; and (2) develop new design theory and strategies that thoughtfully take into account differences in capabilities between human and artificial co-performers, and show sensitivity to the power dynamics involved when different ideas of appropriate practice come together in situated performance.",124
Social Influence and Reciprocity in Online Gift Giving,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656694,"giving gifts is a fundamental part of human relationships that is being affected by technology. the internet enables people to give at the last minute and over long distances, and to observe friends giving and receiving gifts. how online gift giving spreads in social networks is therefore important to understand. we examine 1.5 million gift exchanges on facebook and show that receiving a gift causes individuals to be 56% more likely to give a gift in the future. additional surveys show that online gift giving was more socially acceptable to those who learned about it by observing friends' participation instead of a non-social encouragement. most receivers pay the gift forward instead of reciprocating directly online, although surveys revealed additional instances of direct reciprocity, where the initial gifting occurred offline. thus, social influence promotes the spread of online gifting, which both complements and substitutes for offline gifting. this research makes progress towards gaining a better understanding of the spread of a fundamental social phenomenon in the real world. this required overcoming a number of methodological challenges. we adopted a mixed-methods approach to triangulate and gain a broader picture of online gift exchange. an exploratory analysis of behavioral data provided initial evidence for peer effects and homophily in age, and the quasi-experimental method provided a credible estimate of peer effects in online gift giving. the survey allowed us to fill in the gaps for offline behavior and highlighted variation in perceived social norms. mixed-methods research approaches like this one can be applied in many other domains, in particular for studying the spread of other socio-technical phenomena.",125
Time for Break: Understanding Information Workers' Sedentary Behavior Through a Break Prompting System,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656605,"extended periods of uninterrupted sedentary behavior are detrimental to long-term health. while prolonged sitting is prevalent among information workers, it is difficult for them to break prolonged sedentary behavior due to the nature of their work. this work aims to understand information workers' intentions & practices around standing or moving breaks. we developed time for break, a break prompting system that enables people to set their desired work duration and prompts them to stand up or move. we conducted an exploratory field study (n = 25) with time for break to collect participants' work & break intentions and behaviors for three weeks, followed by semi-structured interviews. we examined rich contexts affecting participants' receptiveness to standing or moving breaks, and identified how their habit strength and self-regulation are related to their break-taking intentions & practices. we discuss design implications for interventions to break up periods of prolonged sedentary behavior in workplaces. we conducted an exploratory study with time for break, a desktop-based prompting system built to collect information workers’ work & break intentions and behaviors, and the contexts around them. from the three weeks of data collection with time for break, pre- & post-study questionnaire, and post-study interviews, we distilled rich contexts affecting participants’ receptiveness to standing or moving breaks, and identified how their habit strength and self-regulation are related to their break-taking intentions & practices. this work opens up a new research avenue going beyond existing works on productivity and interruptibility. we presented many research opportunities to promote healthy workplace environment. specifically, we discussed the importance of “long-term health” as an important design value, needs to promote moving breaks in workplaces, and ways to help information workers form healthy and consistent work & break rhythm. we also identified several ways to extend time for break to be an effective and sustainable intervention to help people break prolonged sedentary behavior in workplaces.",126
Breaking the Tracking: Enabling Weight Perception using Perceivable Tracking Offsets,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656606,"virtual reality (vr) technology strives to enable a highly immersive experience for the user by including a wide variety of modalities (e.g. visuals, haptics). current vr hardware however lacks a sufficient way of communicating the perception of weight of an object, resulting in scenarios where users can not distinguish between lifting a bowling ball or a feather. we propose a solely software based approach of simulating weight in vr by deliberately using perceivable tracking offsets. these tracking offsets nudge users to lift their arm higher and result in a visual and haptic perception of weight. we conducted two user studies showing that participants intuitively associated them with the sensation of weight and accept them as part of the virtual world. we further show that compared to no weight simulation, our approach led to significantly higher levels of presence, immersion and enjoyment. finally, we report perceptional thresholds and offset boundaries as design guidelines for practitioners. in this paper we presented a solely software based approach for tracking based vr interactions to generate a visual perception of weight. our approach is based on introducing a controlled and perceivable tracking offset whereas heavier weights are represented as a higher offset. to gain a deeper understanding of the perception and effectiveness of our approach we conducted two user studies. we were able to show that people associate different tracking offset as different weights. using a two-alternative forced-choice task we could quantify the detection threshold between two weights for light (approx. 2.5 cm) and heavy objects (approx. 3.6 cm). we also found, that users like even obvious and perceivable offsets of 24 cm as weight representation. by testing our approach not only for measuring perceptual thresholds, as it was done in related works, but also in a fully immersive vr game, we contribute to the positive effects on haptic perception as well as presence, immersion and enjoyment. we could show that our pseudohaptic approach results in a significant better experiences than the currently non-existent simulation of weight. since our approach does not require any additional hardware, we argue that our approach can easily be implemented inside all current tracking based vr applications.",127
Remixed Reality: Manipulating Space and Time in Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656607,"we present remixed reality, a novel form of mixed reality. in contrast to classical mixed reality approaches where users see a direct view or video feed of their environment, with remixed reality they see a live 3d reconstruction, gathered from multiple external depth cameras. this approach enables changing the environment as easily as geometry can be changed in virtual reality, while allowing users to view and interact with the actual physical world as they would in augmented reality. we characterize a taxonomy of manipulations that are possible with remixed reality: spatial changes such as erasing objects; appearance changes such as changing textures; temporal changes such as pausing time; and viewpoint changes that allow users to see the world from different points without changing their physical location. we contribute a method that uses an underlying voxel grid holding information like visibility and transformations, which is applied to live geometry in real time. in this work we introduced remixed reality, a novel form of mixed reality. it allows users to see the actual physical world but perform changes as easily as in virtual reality. this is enabled by presenting and modifying a live 3d reconstruction of the environment, captured through multiple external depth cameras. we believe this approach allows for applications that require altering users’ surrounding space such as diminished reality, as well applications where users want to make temporal changes like pausing time, or recording and playing back specific events.",128
Mapping Machine Learning Advances from HCI Research to Reveal Starting Places for Design Innovation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656608,"hci has become particularly interested in using machine learning (ml) to improve user experience (ux). however, some design researchers claim that there is a lack of design innovation in envisioning how ml might improve ux. we investigate this claim by analyzing 2,494 related hci research publications. our review confirmed a lack of research integrating ux and ml. to help span this gap, we mined our corpus to generate a topic landscape, mapping out 7 clusters of ml technical capabilities within hci. among them, we identified 3 under-explored clusters that design researchers can dig in and create sensitizing concepts for. to help operationalize these technical design materials, our analysis then identified value channels through which the technical capabilities can provide value for users: self, context, optimal, and utility-capability. the clusters and the value channels collectively mark starting places for envisioning new ways for ml technology to improve people's lives. the goal of this paper was to provide an analysis of the current landscape of hci research in relation to ml, and organize the diverse design opportunities that comprise this field. to do so, we categorized the hci-ml work into two frameworks. we created seven topic clusters of ml technologies and a conceptual model showing how users experience value from ml enhanced systems. the technical topics and value channels can serve as descriptors for what has been done and provide starting points for future ux innovations. we encourage fellow researchers to use, evaluate, discuss and improve these frameworks, and join us in releasing the potential for better, more creative, more sophisticated design with ml. we also want to step back for a moment to more broadly consider the idea of mining ml advances in research to inform and inspire design researchers. one limitation of the presented frameworks is a lack of evaluation. the intended outcome of this approach — inspiring design researchers and making them desire to create sensitizing concepts or undertaking research on ml — is a very difficult thing to measure because it is nearly impossible to control for. instead, if hci design researchers accept the argument that ml as a design material adds value to ux, what our frameworks provide is a concrete way for them to begin to investigate ml in their own research and design. in addition, the ml research topic landscape and the inference-acting ml capability schema offer the practical value for their design, taking stock of what is known and to identify major unknown topics as a basis for their future research endeavor. we strongly encourage the ux and hci research community to join us and start a serious discussion around the innovation issues related to the idea that ml is the new ux.",129
Pentelligence: Combining Pen Tip Motion and Writing Sounds for Handwritten Digit Recognition,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656609,"digital pens emit ink on paper and digitize handwriting. the range of the pen is typically limited to a special writing surface on which the pen's tip is tracked. we present pentelligence, a pen for handwritten digit recognition that operates on regular paper and does not require a separate tracking device. it senses the pen tip's motions and sound emissions when stroking. pen motions and writing sounds exhibit complementary properties. combining both types of sensor data substantially improves the recognition rate. hilbert envelopes of the writing sounds and mean-filtered motion data are fed to neural networks for majority voting. the results on a dataset of 9408 handwritten digits taken from 26 individuals show that motion+sound outperforms single-sensor approaches at an accuracy of 78.4% for 10 test users. retraining the networks for a single writer on a dataset of 2120 samples increased the precision to 100% for single handwritten digits at an overall accuracy of 98.3%. we reported the design of a digital pen for common writing surfaces, such as paper, that does not require a special pattern and is not confined to a particular area or drawing order. the designed pen does not strongly differ from regular pens in appearance (except for a wired usb connection) and is built from cheap and robust components. the evaluation based on a corpus of digit data shows that the pen achieves high recognition rates. the combination of motion and audio data performs substantially better than motion data alone or audio data alone. it turns out that these types of sensor data have complementary characteristics. it was also shown that majority voting neural networks, each with the same topology, provide a more accurate classification than single networks. furthermore we found that combining the strengths of audio and motion features achieves better results when motion data are classified first and then the result is evaluated by classifiers trained on the sound emissions of the pen tip. retraining the classifiers for a single writer on a dataset of 900 samples turned out to achieve very high recognition rates of 98.33%. it was also stated from a survey that users accept the recording of their handwriting for individualizing the neural networks. in future research the wired connection should be replaced by a wireless implementation, which was also the outcome of the questionnaire. to provide a wide field of application the dataset has to be extended to letters and gestures. deep neural networks with a higher amount of training data and different topologies could be observed to achieve higher recognition rates on all test users before individualization as well as the impact of different surfaces or background noises. a live application such as a phone number dialing or a calculator as well was numeral password entry can be implemented to evaluate the user experience. writer identification is also a research topic in which this pen could be applied. future research will focus on letters, bigrams, and words with subsequent auto-correction to cover a wide spectrum of handwriting recognition.",130
Exploring Multimodal Watch-back Tactile Display using Wind and Vibration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656600,"a tactile display on the back of a smartwatch is an attractive output option; however, its channel capacity is limited owing to the small contact area. in order to expand the channel capacity, we considered using two perceptually distinct types of stimuli, wind and vibration, together on the same skin area. the result is a multimodal tactile display that combines wind and vibration to create ""colored"" tactile sensations on the wrist. as a first step toward this goal, we conducted in this study four user experiments with a wind-vibration tactile display to examine different ways of combining wind and vibration: individual, sequential, and simultaneous. the results revealed the sequential combination of wind and vibration to exhibit the highest potential, with an information transfer capacity of 3.29 bits. in particular, the transition of tactile modality was perceived at an accuracy of 98.52%. the current results confirm the feasibility and potential of a multimodal tactile display combining wind and vibration. in this study, we investigated the feasibility of a multimodal watch-back tactile display using wind and vibration. we proposed a series of application scenarios for combining wind and vibration patterns. to verify if the scenarios are feasible, we conducted four pattern recognition experiments. the results revealed that the sequential patterns are highly perceivable. we hope that the experimental results of the current study will contribute toward motivating further studies on multimodal wearable tactile displays.",131
eKichabi: Information Access through Basic Mobile Phones in Rural Tanzania,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656601,"this paper presents ekichabi, a tool for retrieving contact information for agriculture-related enterprises in tanzania. ekichabi is an unstructured supplementary service data (ussd) application which users can access through basic mobile phones. we describe our focus groups, a design iteration, deployment in four villages, and follow up interviews by phone. this work demonstrates the feasibility of ussd for information access applications that have the potential for deployment on a large scale in the developing world. from user interviews, we identified strong evidence of ekichabi fulfilling an unmet need for business related information, both in identifying business contacts in other villages, as well locating specific service providers. one of our key findings demonstrates that users access information through multiple modes, including text search, in addition to menu navigation organized by both business sector category and geographic area. the initial deployment of the ekichabi demonstrated the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of a third-party ussd application for on-demand information access. the use of ussd for applications such as the ekichabi is well suited to people living in rural, developing areas, as ussd functions on all mobile phones, and can be deployed inexpensively. the ekichabi project also demonstrates the successful conversion of a paper phone book into an electronic application, which is the only feasible method of scaling such a directory to include more businesses, cover a larger geographical area, and reach a greater number of users.",132
Understanding Identity Presentation in Medical Crowdfunding,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656602,"people desire to present themselves favorably to others. however, medical crowdfunding beneficiaries are often expected to present their dire medical conditions and financial straits to solicit financial support. to investigate how beneficiaries convey their situation on medical crowdfunding pages and how contributors perceive the presented information, we interviewed both medical crowdfunding beneficiaries and contributors. while beneficiaries emphasized the serious of their medical situations to signal their deservedness of support, contributor participants gave less attention to that content. rather, they focused on their impression of the beneficiary's character formed by various features of contributions such as the contributor's names, messages, and shared pictures. these contribution features further signaled common connections between the beneficiary and contributors and each contributor's unique involvement in the beneficiary's medical journey. however, the contribution amount resulted in judgement about other contributors. we suggest design opportunities and challenges that apply these results to the design of medical crowdfunding interfaces. in this work we first examined how medical crowdfunding beneficiaries present their identity on a campaign and how contributors perceive them. we then explored how beneficiaries and contributors prefer to present monetary and non-monetary contributions. from the interviews with both beneficiaries and contributors of medical crowdfunding campaigns, we found that beneficiary participants often felt obligated to emphasize their ailing identity to signal that they deserved financial support. however, contributor participants were more interested in signals conveying the beneficiary’s character and their common connections to the beneficiary. interestingly, the beneficiary’s character and common connections were often inferred from various contribution features (e.g., contributor names, messages, shared images). these contribution features also supported beneficiary participants in telling stories about how each contributor was involved in their medical journey. furthermore, the storytelling aspect allowed beneficiary participants to view themselves as people who are valued members of a community. however, our participants did not want to publicly display the contribution amount because the amounts sometimes made contributors judge others negatively. thus, we suggest designing a medical crowdfunding interface that can better assist storytelling rather than focus on the donation amount. we hope this medical crowdfunding storytelling interface can help both beneficiaries and contributors be more aware of how they are involved in a supportive community throughout the process of medical crowdfunding.",133
Pocket Transfers: Interaction Techniques for Transferring Content from Situated Displays to Mobile Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656603,"we present pocket transfers: interaction techniques that allow users to transfer content from situated displays to a personal mobile device while keeping the device in a pocket or bag. existing content transfer solutions require direct manipulation of the mobile device, making inter-action slower and less flexible. our introduced tech-niques employ touch, mid-air gestures, gaze, and a mul-timodal combination of gaze and mid-air gestures. we evaluated the techniques in a novel user study (n=20), where we considered dynamic scenarios where the user approaches the display, completes the task, and leaves. we show that all pocket transfer techniques are fast and seen as highly convenient. mid-air gestures are the most efficient touchless method for transferring a single item, while the multimodal method is the fastest touchless method when multiple items are transferred. we provide guidelines to help researchers and practitioners choose the most suitable content transfer techniques for their systems. we presented pocket transfers: interaction techniques that allow content being transferred from a situated display to a personal mobile device, while keeping the mobile device in a pocket or bag throughout the interaction process. in a 20- participant user study, we evaluated four techniques employing touch, mid-air gestures, gaze, and a multimodal technique combining mid-air gestures and gaze, and compared them to qr codes, which served as a baseline condition. we found that pocket transfers are fast and convenient across different modalities and designs. users highly appreciate not having the manipulate the mobile device, independent of the technique used. touch and mid-air gestures were the fastest techniques for quick interactions wherein only a single content item is transferred. touch and multimodal were the fastest techniques for interactions wherein multiple items are transferred. for situations where other people are present, gaze was the most preferred technique due to its subtlety. our work is useful to researchers and practitioners in a multitude of ways. first, we showed that content transfer methods where the recipient device remains in a pocket are generally fast and useful, and are therefore a solid consideration for a variety of content transfer systems. second, we presented four designs for state-of-the-art pocket transfer techniques employing three different modalities as well as a combination of two modalities. third, we recognized strengths and weaknesses for each technique, and presented guidelines to help researchers and practitioners choose the most suitable modalities and techniques for their content transfer systems. finally, we presented a novel user study design, wherein participants completed tasks that included the full interaction process, including preparation for, and halting of, the interaction. this way, we argue we reached more ecologically valid results. we encourage researchers to utilize such approaches in future studies.",134
"Understanding the Family Perspective on the Storage, Sharing and Handling of Family Civic Data",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655416,"across social care, healthcare and public policy, enabled by the ""big data"" revolution (which has normalized large-scale data-based decision-making), there are moves to ""join up"" citizen databases to provide care workers with holistic views of families they support. in this context, questions of personal data privacy, security, access, control and (dis-)empowerment are critical considerations for system designers and policy makers alike. to explore the family perspective on this landscape of what we call family civic data, we carried out ethnographic interviews with four north-east families. our design-game-based interviews were effective for engaging both adults and children to talk about the impact of this dry, technical topic on their lives. our findings, delivered in the form of design guidelines, show support for dynamic consent: families would feel most empowered if involved in an ongoing co-operative relationship with state welfare and civic authorities through shared interaction with their data. using our novel family design games technique, we have shown that families – both adults and children – can be engaged in meaningful conversation about the complex and esoteric topic of family civic data. through these homebased activities we have gained a rich qualitative understanding of families’ requirements for the handling of their data, and derived guidelines that can inform the design of future data-handling systems and associated organizational processes: state organizations must support a dynamic consent model of data handling, and plan for a new paradigm of co-operative, data-based relationships with families, one where meaningful, representative data is nurtured for mutual benefit and families remain involved throughout.",135
The Effects of Adding Search Functionality to Interactive Visualizations on the Web,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655417,"the widespread use of text-based search in user interfaces has led designers in visualization to occasionally add search functionality to their creations. yet it remains unclear how search may impact a person's behavior. given the unstructured context of the web, users may not have explicit information-seeking goals and designers cannot make assumptions about user attention. to bridge this gap, we observed the impact of integrating search with five visualizations across 830 online participants. in an unguided task, we find that (1) the presence of text-based search influences people's information-seeking goals, (2) search can alter the data that people explore and how they engage with it, and (3) the effects of search are amplified in visualizations where people are familiar with the underlying dataset. these results suggest that text-search in web visualizations drives users towards more diverse information seeking goals, and may be valuable in a range of existing visualization designs. across the web, designers build thousands of data-dense visualizations for the public to explore and comprehend. surprisingly, only a very small subset of these visualizations are accompanied by text-based search mechanisms. while textbased search has often been used in conjunction with large datasets for analysts, our results suggest that its inclusion in everyday visualizations, even those with relatively small amounts of data, may encourage engagement and support user information seeking goals that are difficult with other forms of interaction. through experiments with five visualizations, we find that in most visualizations, a majority of users will use text-based search features if present, and that search can shape people’s experience and behavior with visualizations. results of the experiments also indicate the average participant who used text-based search engaged with individual data items for longer, and explored different parts of the data. the results of these experiments have practical implications for design, and more broadly serve as a case study in how interactive data visualizations can be augmented to support diverse information seeking goals.",136
Towards Design Principles for Visual Analytics in Operations Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655418,"operations engineering teams interact with complex data systems to make technical decisions that ensure the operational efficacy of their missions. to support these decision-making tasks, which may require elastic prioritization of goals dependent on changing conditions, custom analytics tools are often developed. we were asked to develop such a tool by a team at the nasa jet propulsion laboratory, where rover telecom operators make decisions based on models predicting how much data rovers can transfer from the surface of mars. through research, design, implementation, and informal evaluation of our new tool, we developed principles to inform the design of visual analytics systems in operations contexts. we offer these principles as a step towards understanding the complex task of designing these systems. the principles we present are applicable to designers and developers tasked with building analytics systems in domains that face complex operations challenges such as scheduling, routing, and logistics. tasked with improving the workflow for mars exploration rover telecommunications operators, we transformed a complex, distributed process into a singular interface that supports efficient and flexible decision-making. reflecting on our design process, we discovered that many of our findings could be distilled into principles broadly applicable across similar domains. in this paper, we have presented seven design principles to inform the design of visual analytics systems in operations contexts. we hope that this contribution inspires continued examination of this space, enhancing the experience of individuals and teams engaged in this constant yet supple work practice.",137
Displaying Invisible Objects: Why People Rarely Re-read E-books,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655419,"this study of paper and e-books investigates how specific affordances of physical and digital objects relate to people's valuations and uses of those objects over time. we found that while the visibility of paper books amplified the meaningfulness of organizational and display actions taken with regards to those objects, the systems that supported interactions with e-books instead tended to make such actions less meaningful. we argue that these systems also discouraged re-uses of e-books for most participants -- the important exceptions being several participants who used the book-focused social networking site goodreads. this paper details how the affordances and limitations that resulted from the material constructions of paper and e-books impacted participants' uses of and feelings towards those objects, and examines the implications of using a supplementary online system for displaying digital objects. through an examination of people’s practices of usage for paper and e-books, this paper has demonstrated how visibility of paper books made maintenance practices meaningful and supported object re-use, both of which had important implications for identity-related uses of objects. we also established an understanding of how returning to favorite objects over time (through re-reading, in this case) contributed to participants’ changing understandings of their own identities, and how this practice was not typically undertaken with e-books – unless their owners engaged in supplementary display practices. finally, we explored the implications of these supplementary display practices, highlighting in particular how they separated display from ownership. we close by noting that research from hci on human interactions with physical and digital objects, in establishing an understanding of how the visibility of physical objects (in contrast to digital objects) reinforces people’s relationships of ownership to those objects, has contributed not only to knowledge within this field but to the field of material culture studies as well.",138
A Visual Interaction Cue Framework from Video Game Environments for Augmented Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655410,"based on an analysis of 49 popular contemporary video games, we develop a descriptive framework of visual interaction cues in video games. these cues are used to inform players what can be interacted with, where to look, and where to go within the game world. these cues vary along three dimensions: the purpose of the cue, the visual design of the cue, and the circumstances under which the cue is shown. we demonstrate that this framework can also be used to describe interaction cues for augmented reality applications. beyond this, we show how the framework can be used to generatively derive new design ideas for visual interaction cues in augmented reality experiences. video game designers have developed and honed a visual language for interaction cues. our interaction cue framework illuminates the roles of purpose, visual design and interaction design for these cues. further, we find that it can describe interaction cues from ar experiences, and we show how designers can use this framework to generate new designs for interaction cues in ar. designers of ar experiences as well as those building ar platforms (e.g. [7]) will be able to build from this work to develop a parallel visual language of interaction cues for ar.",139
HARK No More: On the Preregistration of CHI Experiments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655411,"experimental preregistration is required for publication in many scientific disciplines and venues. when experimental intentions are preregistered, reviewers and readers can be confident that experimental evidence in support of reported hypotheses is not the result of harking, which stands for hypothesising after the results are known. we review the motivation and outcomes of experimental preregistration across a variety of disciplines, as well as previous work commenting on the role of evaluation in hci research. we then discuss how experimental preregistration could be adapted to the distinctive characteristics of human-computer interaction empirical research, to the betterment of the discipline. many scientific disciplines have concluded that experimental preregistration is an essential part of their discipline. it overcomes or reduces many substantial problems that are demonstrable in their literature, including harking, publication bias, and the file drawer effect. when registries are appropriately equipped, experimental preregistration also facilitates replication and meta-analyses. the nature of hci empirical research raises some challenges for preregistration, particularly its strong and appropriate reliance on iterative exploratory design and evaluation. however, preregistration can offer advantages even for exploratory work. regardless of exploratory studies, much of the research knowledge within hci is derived from formal experiments that make use of nhst, and for these studies our discipline is every bit as susceptible to problems of absent preregistration as any other; the potential benefits are equivalent too. ideally preregistration would promote empirical publications being judged on the quality of the research, including the potential interest of the hypothesis, not simply whether they give the ‘right’ results. hci research can sharpen its methods and rigour by introducing experimental preregistration.",140
Designing Coherent Gesture Sets for Multi-scale Navigation on Tabletops,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655412,"multi-scale navigation interfaces were originally designed to enable single users to explore large visual information spaces on desktop workstations. these interfaces can also be quite useful on tabletops. however, their adaptation to co-located multi-user contexts is not straightforward. the literature describes different interfaces, that only offer a limited subset of navigation actions. in this paper, we first identify a comprehensive set of actions to effectively support multi-scale navigation. we report on a guessability study in which we elicited user-defined gestures for triggering these actions, showing that there is no natural design solution, but that users heavily rely on the now-ubiquitous slide, pinch and turn gestures. we then propose two interface designs based on this set of three basic gestures: one involves two-hand variations on these gestures, the other combines them with widgets. a comparative study suggests that users can easily learn both, and that the gesture-based, visually-minimalist design is a viable option, that saves display space for other controls. this paper presents and structures a space of sixteen multiscale navigation actions for collaborative work on tabletops. a guessability study supports the hypothesis that users expect an interaction vocabulary based on a core set of three basic gestures (slide, pinch and turn), which have now become a standard for touch-based interfaces, popularized by applications such as google maps. we propose and evaluate two possible designs for triggering this set of sixteen desirable actions without resorting to complex gestures. interestingly, even if our gesture-based design provides less visual guidance than our widget-based design, participants in our study were able to recall how to trigger actions equally well with one or the other, and this even when coming back more than a day after having learnt how to use them. this suggests that interface designers could include a quick start guide for gesture-based navigation controls, in order to get a minimalist, more pleasant design and potentially save display space for other controls. by giving users the possibility to manipulate text elements (labels, annotations, etc.) independently from the rest of the representation, we hint at multi-layer manipulation in touchbased multi-scale interfaces. we plan to work on a design solution that scales with more than two layers. this probably requires considering a hybrid approach mixing widgets, gestures and tangibles in order to avoid using complex gestures and generating too much visual clutter. we also plan to study multi-scale navigation in multi-surface environments that feature several large screens (tabletops and walls), and small devices (tablets and smartphones). our distributed architecture and web-based implementation already support the instantiation of detailed views on separate devices, facilitating the implementation of tangible personal views similar to those in, e.g., [30]. besides the technical aspects, these complex setups raise many interesting research questions in terms of interaction design, such as how to facilitate the transition between the context and the personal views, or how to have a personal view linked to several contexts.",141
HindSight: Enhancing Spatial Awareness by Sonifying Detected Objects in Real-Time 360-Degree Video,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655413,"our perception of our surrounding environment is limited by the constraints of human biology. the field of augmented perception asks how our sensory capabilities can be usefully extended through computational means. we argue that spatial awareness can be enhanced by exploiting recent advances in computer vision which make high-accuracy, real-time object detection feasible in everyday settings. we introduce hindsight, a wearable system that increases spatial awareness by detecting relevant objects in live 360-degree video and sonifying their position and class through bone conduction headphones. hindsight uses a deep neural network to locate and attribute semantic information to objects surrounding a user through a head-worn panoramic camera. it then uses bone conduction headphones, which preserve natural auditory acuity, to transmit audio notifications for detected objects of interest. we develop an application using hindsight to warn cyclists of approaching vehicles outside their field of view and evaluate it in an exploratory study with 15 users. participants reported increases in perceived safety and awareness of approaching vehicles when using hindsight. we introduced hindsight, a wearable system that increases spatial awareness by detecting relevant objects in live, egocentric 360-degree video and sonifying their attributes through bone conduction headphones. hindsight draws upon advances in computer vision and work in delivering continuous feedback for physical tasks to identify points of interest in a user’s surroundings and notify the user when necessary to redirect their attention. our analysis suggests that at current detection performance, bicyclists can be notified in time to react to dangers when vehicles travel up 8.6 m/s faster than the cyclists. this margin may be sufficient for many, but not all urban cycling situations. progress in camera technology and object classification can further improve on this threshold. in our exploratory study, we find hindsight increased users’ reported comfort, awareness, reaction time, and safety, and identify potential avenues for future work, such as reducing the recall rate of object detection and designing broader audio experiences for users. while our prototype is somewhat limited by the need to wear a laptop with a powerful gpu, multiple hardware companies are currently developing chips can run deep neural networks in real time, which would make a truly portable solution feasible. beyond the domain of cycling, we believe that combining an enhanced awareness of visual periphery with the rich semantic understanding of objects and scenes from computer vision techniques has the potential to enable an entire new class of applications that improve on unaided human capabilities.",142
Uncertainty Displays Using Quantile Dotplots or CDFs Improve Transit Decision-Making,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655414,"everyday predictive systems typically present point predictions, making it hard for people to account for uncertainty when making decisions. evaluations of uncertainty displays for transit prediction have assessed people's ability to extract probabilities, but not the quality of their decisions. in a controlled, incentivized experiment, we had subjects decide when to catch a bus using displays with textual uncertainty, uncertainty visualizations, or no-uncertainty (control). frequency-based visualizations previously shown to allow people to better extract probabilities (quantile dotplots) yielded better decisions. decisions with quantile dotplots with 50 outcomes were(1) better on average, having expected payoffs 97% of optimal(95% ci: [95%,98%]), 5 percentage points more than control (95% ci: [2,8]); and (2) more consistent, having within-subject standard deviation of 3 percentage points (95% ci:[2,4]), 4 percentage points less than control (95% ci: [2,6]).cumulative distribution function plots performed nearly as well, and both outperformed textual uncertainty, which was sensitive to the probability interval communicated. we discuss implications for real time transit predictions and possible generalization to other domains. in this paper, we demonstrate that including uncertainty displays in realtime transit decision-making can produce higher quality decisions. using a method adapted from experimental economics, we successfully tracked serial decision making to evaluate what type of uncertainty displays produced the highest quality decisions. we found that cumulative distribution function (cdf) plots and low-density quantile dotplots produce more accurate and consistent decisions compared to other uncertainty visualizations, textual displays, and displays with no uncertainty. we also found that when using uncertainty displays, decision quality can improve over time. the types of displays that we have found to be the best for supporting decision-making in the transit have also been shown to be more accurate at estimating probability intervals more generally, suggesting that our results may generalize to similar situations where the same type of uncertainty information would help inform decision-making.",143
What to Put on the User: Sensing Technologies for Studies and Physiology Aware Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655425,"fitness trackers not just provide easy means to acquire physiological data in real-world environments due to affordable sensing technologies, they further offer opportunities for physiology-aware applications and studies in hci; however, their performance is not well understood. in this paper, we report findings on the quality of 3 sensing technologies: ppg-based wrist trackers (apple watch, microsoft band 2), an ecg-belt (polar h7) and reference device with stick-on ecg electrodes (nexus 10). we collected physiological (heart rate, electrodermal activity, skin temperature) and subjective data from 21 participants performing combinations of physical activity and stressful tasks. our empirical research indicates that wrist devices provide a good sensing performance in stationary settings. however, they lack accuracy when participants are mobile or if tasks require physical activity. based on our findings, we suggest a textitdesign space for wearables in research settings and reflected on the appropriateness of the investigated technologies in research contexts. by this work, we first contribute a comparison between ppg, wrist devices (apple watch, microsoft band 2) against an ecg chest strap (polar h7 chest belt) and a laboratory measurement instrument with stick-on ecg technology (nexus 10 kit) under different physical and stressful conditions. to evaluate the reliability of the named sensing technologies, we investigated the differences in physiological data measured by the devices (hypotheses 1a and h1b) confirming that ppgwearables tend to be less accurate in movement and the data gets less suitable for sensitive research settings. we further checked the influence of stress on physiological data under stationary and physical activity (hypothesis 2) which could be only partly confirmed owed to the lack of accuracy in the devices. as another contribution, we could show that perceived stress and arousal (tense and wake) correlate with the physiological data suggesting a strong relation between physiological and subjectively felt stress, whereas there no correlations for valence and dominance observed (hypotheses 3). based on our findings, we lastly contribute a design space for wearables used in research settings addressing five dimension covering important criteria for choosing an appropriate measurement tool for research purposes. in future work, we plan to investigate noise reduction by using the accelerometer data, which is readily available in most consumer devices. therefore, we will compare more wearables involving new products using improved sensors and data extraction algorithms. also most of these wearables are not scientifically validated for their accuracy and validity. novel consumer devices even target well-being aspects and stress such as the garmin vivosmart 310, which claims to use hrv to calculate a proprietary stress score throughout the day. in terms of stress and emotion detection, we plan to have a closer look at stress detection through wearables in the wild as there are already approaches based on mobile sensing data [10, 40]. the combination of those approaches with wearable physiological data could lead to more accurate predictions and models [20]. by this work we believe to have presented a first step towards assessing sensing technologies in wearables for their reliability and accuracy, as well as having provided fruitful insights for other researchers when it comes to decide which measurement tool to use in a study.",144
Lost in Migration: Information Management and Community Building in an Online Health Community,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655426,"the ever-growing volume of information within online health communities (ohcs) presents an urgent need for new solutions that improve the efficiency of information organization and retrieval for their members. to meet this need, ohcs may choose to adopt off-the-shelf platforms that provide novel features for information management, but were not specifically designed to meet these communities' needs. the questions remain, however, as to the impact of these new platforms on social dynamics within ohcs and their well-being. to examine these questions, we qualitatively studied a migration of a popular ohc, focusing on diabetes self-management, between two off-the-shelf social computing platforms. despite improving information management, the migration served as a catalyst to reveal the importance of features for identity management and closed circle communication that were not apparent to either the management or the membership of the community. we describe the study and draw implications for research and design for ohcs. in this work we studied changes in the attitudes, perception, and social dynamics of an ohc after migration to a new technical platform. the study further highlighted the need to balance informational and socio-emotional support features in the scp for ohcs. further, it pointed to the difficulty and the importance of recognizing the true importance of social behaviors in the community and their connections to scp features, and provided descriptions of these connections. finally, the study suggested the need for new approaches to the design of ohc platforms that allow for easy and flexible configuration of features based on prioritization of the value-driven behaviors types, and monitoring tools for discovering new potential connections between those behaviors and scp features.",145
On Visual Granularity: Collocated Sales Meeting Interactions in the Machine Industry,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655427,"visual representations are being used in typical sales meetings of the machine industry to exchange information and support social interactions. in these meetings, sales representatives design for granularity by taking into account verbal and visual details of communication. our article builds on increasingly occurring collocated interactions in sales meetings investigating the social relevance of mobile devices in face-to-face settings. the article aims to understand the supporting and disturbing role of visual granularity in sales meetings and develops design implications for interaction designers. we conducted an ethnographic study of sales meetings in material handling and paper machine industries, including conversation analysis (ca) of video recordings, and involving groups of professional analysts that are seldom used in hci. our findings draw evidence from sales meetings and design processes on successful and unsuccessful use of granularity in visual representations. finally, we propose seven design guidelines for visual granularity striving to understand buyers' perceptions and visual qualities. sales representatives of the machine industry increasingly use mobile devices in collocated settings, taking into account how granularity in spoken and visual form and details shape the conversation during meetings. the article focused on visual granularity either supporting or disturbing sales conversation. we conducted two years of collaboration with two machine industries obtaining different types of data from sales settings. these included multiple conversation analysis (ca) sessions of videoed excerpts by groups of researchers from the fields of interaction design, sociology, linguistics and organisational management. findings elaborate insights on granularity in understanding specific messengers and recipients, contexts, allocating senses on visual details and original ownership of information in sales conversation. seven design implications firstly revolve around seeking information about devices and buyers from sales reps, customer databases and meetings. secondly, these result as qualities of designing glanceable visualisations, being relevant to buyers with considerations of time used in designing, complexity and adaptability. the study contributes to the hci community in terms of visualising granularity in contexts involving extensive information flow and using groups of professional conversations analysts. in future research, we concentrate on gaze detection and sound to enrich the understanding on connections of utterances and visual details.",146
Distance and Attraction: Gravity Models for Geographic Content Production,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655428,"volunteered geographic information (vgi), such as contributions to openstreetmap and geotagged wikipedia articles, is often assumed to be produced locally. however, recent work has found that peer-produced vgi is frequently contributed by non-locals. we evaluate this approach across hundreds of content types from wikipedia, openstreetmap, and ebird, and show that these models can describe more than 90% of ""vgi flows"" for some content types. our findings advance geographic hci theory, suggesting some spatial mechanisms underpinning vgi production. we also discuss design implications that can help (a) human and algorithmic consumers of vgi evaluate the perspectives it contains and (b) address geographic coverage variations in these platforms (e.g. via more effective volunteer recruitment strategies). in this paper, we showed that vgi contributions can be modeled effectively using spatial interaction techniques, and gravity models in particular. we also explored the implications of these findings for our understanding of vgi, for stakeholders currently managing large vgi communities, and for the development of future vgi platforms.",147
MatchSticks: Woodworking through Improvisational Digital Fabrication,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655429,"digital fabrication tools have broadened participation in making and enabled new methods of rapid physical prototyping across diverse materials. we present a novel smart tool designed to complement one of the first materials employed by humans - wood - and celebrate the fabrication practice of joinery. our tool, matchsticks, is a digital fabrication system tailored for joinery. combining a portable cnc machine, touchscreen user interface, and parametric joint library, matchsticks enables makers of varying skill to rapidly explore and create artifacts from wood. our system embodies tacit woodworking knowledge and distills the distributed workflow of cnc tools into a hand tool; it operates on materials existing machines find difficult, produces assemblies much larger than its workspace, and supports the parallel creation of geometries. we describe the workflow and technical details of our system, present example artifacts produced by our tool, and report results from our user study. in this paper, we introduced matchsticks, a digital fabrication system for joinery. our tool introduces complementary capabilities to the domain of digital and hand tools used in woodworking while further exploring the area of interactive smart tools. we introduced novel hardware that is capable of expressing a large vocabulary of joints as well as software for design and fabrication that is similarly tuned to the domain of joinery. our system enables the fabrication of geometries and assemblies that are (1) difficult to create using other tools, (2) larger than the tool itself, and (3) parallelizable in production. by eliminating the need to interact with a separate computer for the design of these joints, we explore how users can much more easily express their design intent directly to the cnc fabrication tool. this directness both empowers novices to incorporate joinery into their practice, while providing experts with an adaptive palette of joinery designs. we validate capabilities of our tool through the production of example artifacts, and a user study of a tutorial workflow.",148
Visuo-Haptic Illusions for Improving the Perceived Performance of Shape Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655420,"in this work, we utilize visuo-haptic illusions to improve the perceived performance of encountered-type haptic devices, specifically shape displays, in virtual reality. shape displays are matrices of actuated pins that travel vertically to render physical shapes; however, they have limitations such as low resolution, small display size, and low pin speed. to address these limitations, we employ illusions such as redirection, scaling, and retargeting that take advantage of the visual dominance effect, the idea that vision often dominates when senses conflict. our evaluation of these techniques suggests that redirecting sloped lines with angles less than 40 degrees onto a horizontal line is an effective technique for increasing the perceived resolution of the display. scaling up the virtual object onto the shape display by a factor less than 1.8x can also increase the perceived resolution. finally, using vertical redirection a perceived 3x speed increase can be achieved. shape displays can provide realistic haptic feedback in virtual reality, however the low resolution, small display size, and the low pin speed of these devices limit their usage. visuo-haptic illusions such as scaling, retargeting, and redirection can be utilized to address these limitations and improve the perceived performance of shape displays. we suggest two methods, angle redirection and upscaling, for improving the perceived resolution of shape displays. we also propose two approaches, retargeting and downscaling, for increasing the perceived size of the display. finally, we increase the perceived speed of the pins by retargeting and vertical redirection. the results of our evaluation suggest that redirecting sloped lines with angles less than 40◦ onto a horizontal line, and scaling up to 1.8x are effective techniques for increasing the perceived resolution of the display. moreover, a 3x perceived speed increase can be achieved by vertical redirection and modifying the c/d ratio.",149
A Schnittmuster for Crafting Context-Sensitive Toolkits,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655421,"diy-making can be an expensive pastime if makers are relying on ready-made toolkits, specialised materials and off-shelf components. many prefabricated commercial kits seek to lower the learning barrier of making and to help beginners to successfully take their first steps in engineering. however, as soon as the novices become a little more advanced, these toolkits often do not fit the specific requirements of personal maker projects anymore. we introduce the idea of a schnittmuster (or a meta-toolkit) as a novel approach to toolkit design that seeks to address these creativity-limiting factors as well as practical entrance hurdles. to demonstrate the adaptive power of the schnittmuster concept, we discuss an exemplar in the context of capacitive touch sensing (flexe-touch). implemented under the constraints of materials, user skill sets and making environments, we illustrate how the schnittmuster facilitated four cheap and flexible toolkit instantiations for crafting custom touch sensor electrodes. in this paper, we presented a schnittmuster approach to designing custom toolkits and illustrated it using the example of flexe-touch tailored for crafting capacitive touch sensor electrodes. a schnittmuster is highly flexible and if used by empathic facilitators can react to a range of otherwise limiting project constraints. if funding is the matter, the costs can be lowered by using cheaper materials. if time and the availability of contributors are limited, it can adapt the manufacturing process by distributing the tasks. if learning about the underlying electronic concepts is the main goal, the activity can provide steps for guided recreation while maintaining space for personalisation and self-paced meaning-making. with the schnittmuster, we contribute a novel critical perspective on and an alternative approach to designing maker toolkits that can assist facilitators of diy electronics activities for novice makers.",150
Repurposing Emoji for Personalised Communication: Why 🍕 means “I love you”,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655422,"the use of emoji in digital communication can convey a wealth of emotions and concepts that otherwise would take many words to express. emoji have become a popular form of communication, with researchers claiming emoji represent a type of ""ubiquitous language"" that can span different languages. in this paper however, we explore how emoji are also used in highly personalised and purposefully secretive ways. we show that emoji are repurposed for something other than their ""intended"" use between close partners, family members and friends. we present the range of reasons why certain emoji get chosen, including the concept of ""emoji affordance"" and explore why repurposing occurs. normally used for speed, some emoji are instead used to convey intimate and personal sentiments that, for many reasons, their users cannot express in words. we discuss how this form of repurposing must be considered in tasks such as emoji-based sentiment analysis. in this paper we have highlighted how people using computer and mobile mediated communication have come to repurpose certain emoji. by using the ambiguity in meaning that emoji naturally have, users can create a shared personal meaning between themselves and another person, or small group, creating a new cultural understanding of particular emoji. this in turn can help people feel closer to one another. previous work has tended to explore emoji understanding on a large cultural level, whereas this work looks at emoji understanding at a micro scale. results of this paper will contribute to future work into emoji sentiment analysis, as the work highlights that emoji do not always correspond to their intended, nor culturally accepted meanings. at times emoji are chosen at random to mean a specific concept, and equally some emoji are chosen purposefully because they convey the complete opposite of the intended sentiment. this implies caution is required when using machine learning techniques to understand the meaning and use of emoji. as with other papers in this area [13,21], we also conclude that a universal rendering of emoji may be required to standardise how they appear across platforms. it is well understood that emoji facial expressions can be misconstrued, for example, but this paper also highlights that discrepancies in rendering can also affect a whole range of emoji that people choose to use due to the way they are drawn. the current method of rendering emoji in a range of different ways may be preventing users from using the implicit affordance of emoji. additionally, the redrawing of emoji must be carefully considered. just as users reacted badly to apple redrawing the peach emoji, smaller communities of other users may be affected by redrawing of any number of emoji currently in use because of how they look, and not what they represent.",151
More Stars or More Reviews?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655423,"the large majority of reputation systems use features such as star ratings and reviews to give users a reputation in online peer-to-peer markets. both have been shown to be effective for signaling trustworthiness. however, the exact extent to which these features can change perceptions of users' trustworthiness remains an open question. using data from an online experiment conducted on airbnb users, we investigate which of the two types of reputation information --average star rating or the number of reviews --is more important for signaling a user's trustworthiness. we find that the relative effectiveness of ratings and reviews differ depending on whether reputation has a strong or a weak differentiation power. our findings show that reputation effects are contingent on and susceptible to the context created by the alternative choices presented to users, highlighting how reputation information is displayed can drastically alter their efficacy for engendering trust. we set out to accomplish two things with our current study. first, we wanted to test for the exact effects of the two core components of the conventional reputation system –average star ratings and review counts –on perceptions of trustworthiness. we tried to achieve this by conducting an investment game on a large population of airbnb users. second, we wanted to understand how design choices can affect assessment of trustworthiness by investigating users’ responses to reputation contexts. we achieved this by constructing and randomly assigning subjects to two reputation conditions – “reputational contexts"" –whereby we varied the distributional characteristics of the reputations of profiles we displayed to subjects. we found that the effect of a profile going from having an average rating of 4 stars to 5 stars is roughly equivalent to having a review count increase of 10 or more –from having 1-3 reviews to having 11+ reviews. yet we also found that when a reputation system has enough differentiating power, the number of review carries more weight than the average ratings. indeed, what is interesting about these results is that the same exact reputation information can have varying efficacy for signaling trustworthy behavior depending on what alternatives that users have. our work thus contributes to the existing work on reputation systems by quantifying exactly how two conventional feature of these systems affect users’ perceptions of others’ trustworthiness and identifying how their effects vary depending on various design choices.",152
Self-Reflection and Personal Physicalization Construction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655424,"self-reflection is a central goal of personal informatics systems, and constructing visualizations from physical tokens has been found to help people reflect on data. however, so far, constructive physicalization has only been studied in lab environments with provided datasets. our qualitative study investigates the construction of personal physicalizations in people's domestic environments over 2-4 weeks. it contributes an understanding of (1) the process of creating personal physicalizations, (2) the types of personal insights facilitated, (3) the integration of self-reflection in the physicalization process, and (4) its benefits and challenges for self-reflection. we found that in constructive personal physicalization, data collection, construction and self-reflections are deeply intertwined. this extends previous models of visualization creation and data-driven self-reflection. we outline how benefits such as reflection through manual construction, personalization, and presence in everyday life can be transferred to a wider set of digital and physical systems. our study provides a first exploration of constructive physicalization in a personal real-world context. we found that the process facilitated deep reflections on the data, personal context, actions and values. we discussed how these reflections are deeply embedded in and supported by the manual construction. the process allowed people to personalize representations and integrate these within their personal environment to spark moments of reflection and conversations. our findings point to exciting directions for design and future research in the context of both physicalization creation and tools for self-reflection. our results further highlight the potential of physicalization construction in a personal context, including the fluid integration with people’s routines, benefits for capturing qualitative and subjective aspects, supporting shared experiences, as well as the potential of using constructive visualizations as a generative tool for planning and creative exploration.",153
G2G: The Design and Evaluation of a Shared Calendar and Messaging System for Grandparents and Grandchildren,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655435,"distance separated grandparents and grandchildren often face challenges in staying connected. to explore this topic, we designed g2g, a shared calendar and video messaging system to connect young children (ages 5-10) with their grandparents over distance. our design focused on providing grandparents and grandchildren with an awareness of each other's lives to support conversations and design elements to help reduce the need for parent scaffolding. a field study with two grandparent-grandchild pairs over two months showed that systems designed around structured communication can help young children develop a routine around staying in touch with their remote grandparents. autonomy in maintaining awareness can help children to be engaged more easily. this suggests that designs focusing on connecting young children to their grandparents over distance should be flexible yet structured and designing to reduce parental scaffolding can lead to positive effects and strengthened relationships.",154
Playing Close to Home: Interaction and Emerging Play in Outdoor Play Installations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655436,"outdoor play is becoming an increasingly marginalised activity in the urban landscape. even in hci, research on interactive solutions for outdoor play has largely been limited to special areas and in particular playgrounds. but children play everywhere, and especially play close to home is central in children's play activities. in this article we draw upon knowledge about designing for children's play in interaction design as well as in landscape architecture, to study how interactive play installations can be integrated in outdoor environments of a residential area. we present a field study in which digitally enhanced play installations were installed, in dialogue with the landscape, in between the buildings of a residential area. we focus on how emerging play activities made use of the installations as well as of the surrounding landscape in expected as well as unexpected ways. based on the observations, we discuss how residential play is special, and how this affects how to design for it. the design for play close to home meets with specific challenges, related to the ways in which children have access, to and learn to know, such installations. through our study, we have highlighted how both the physical aspects of the space and the social practices of a residential area work to influence the play behavior that emerges around such installations. the installations in this trial were temporary, which made it difficult to fully arrive at an integrated design of technology and landscape. the digifys project is currently approaching its final phase, in which we will be making permanent installations in close to home places. through the close collaboration with municipality representatives, we have been given the opportunity to include interactive installations in the rebuilding of two recreational areas in the immediate vicinity of housing areas. these installations will allow us to design for, and study, long term engagement, as well as force us to address organizational issues related to the upkeep and maintenance of equipment over time. creating permanent installations provides the opportunity to not only adapt the installations to an existing landscape, but allows us to also in part shape that landscape. the permanency of these installations wiil also be the ultimate challenge for and final test of the longevity of the play activities that emerge around this type of installations.",155
"CFar: A Tool to Increase Communication, Productivity, and Review Quality in Collaborative Code Reviews",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655437,"collaborative code review has become an integral part of the collaborative design process in the domain of software development. however, there are well-documented challenges and limitations to collaborative code review---for instance, high-quality code reviews may require significant time and effort for the programmers, whereas faster, lower-quality reviews may miss code defects. to address these challenges, we introduce cfar, a novel tool design for extending collaborative code review systems with an automated code reviewer whose feedback is based on program-analysis technologies. to validate this design, we implemented cfar as a production-quality tool and conducted a mixed-method empirical evaluation of the tool usage at microsoft. through the field deployment of our tool and a laboratory study of professional programmers using the tool, we produced several key findings showing that cfar enhances communication, productivity, and review quality in human--human collaborative code review. in this paper, we introduced the novel cfar tool design for extending collaborative code review systems with an automated code reviewer that uses program analyses to enhance communication, productivity, and review quality in human–human collaborative code review. our mixed-method empirical evaluation of cfar produced several key findings: • rq1 (communication): 45% of programmers who used cfar for their work indicated that the tool increased communication, and over 60% indicated that it enhanced collaboration. (only 7% and 14% of participants, respectively, disagreed with these benefits.) • rq2 (productivity): 38% of programmers who used cfar indicated that it increased their productivity (versus only 19% who disagreed), and multiple participants indicated that a key reason was that it freed them from dealing with shallow defects. • rq3 (code quality): 48% of programmers who used cfar indicated that it helped increase code quality (versus one who disagreed), and several expressed that a key reason was that it identified defects that a human reviewer would miss. • rq4 (user opinions): all but one programmer who used cfar found it useful, and 69% expressed that they liked the tool (versus only one programmer who did not). we hope that cfar and our findings represent a substantial step toward more efficient and more effective collaborative code review systems. a promising direction for future work is to explore novel ways in which a human may interact with an automated code reviewer. for instance, to debug an analysis comment, a review participant might require more information than that provided by the analysis warning. in such cases, the automated reviewer could display, upon request, the code parts that are to blame for the warning and even suggested fixes. our tool design and implementation elicited considerable optimism from programmers at microsoft, which revealed an even larger opportunity for tools to improve code reviewing. tools like cfar could continue to help programmers, as was the case for one of our participants.",156
Announcing Pregnancy Loss on Facebook: A Decision-Making Framework for Stigmatized Disclosures on Identified Social Network Sites,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655438,"pregnancy loss is a common experience that is often not disclosed in spite of potential disclosure benefits such as social support. to understand how and why people disclose pregnancy loss online, we interviewed 27 women in the u.s. who are social media users and had recently experienced pregnancy loss. we developed a decision-making framework explaining pregnancy loss disclosures on identified social network sites (sns) such as facebook. we introduce network-level reciprocal disclosure, a theory of how disclosure reciprocity, usually applied to understand dyadic exchanges, can operate at the level of a social network to inform decision-making about stigmatized disclosures in identified snss. we find that 1) anonymous disclosures on other sites help facilitate disclosure on identified sites (e.g., facebook), and 2) awareness campaigns enable sharing about pregnancy loss for many who would not disclose otherwise. finally, we discuss conceptual and design implications. caution: this paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss. this work contributes a framework that explains disclosures of pregnancy loss on identified snss. this framework includes six types of decision factors: self-related, audiencerelated, societal, platform and affordance-related, networklevel, and temporal. while pregnancy loss was the focus in this paper, we suggest that this framework could be applicable to other sensitive disclosures on identified snss where people connect with others they know and use their physical world identities. we encourage researchers to evaluate our framework in other contexts. within our framework, we introduce a theoretical construct, networklevel reciprocal disclosure, as a concept that can motivate social computing system designs to better promote sensitive disclosures and social support exchange. further, we found that prior anonymous online participation facilitated disclosures of pregnancy loss on facebook, that one-to-many disclosures on facebook are appreciated because by doing so people in distress can avoid many painful one-to-one disclosures, and that social media awareness campaigns prompt disclosures motivated by network-level, societal, and temporal factors. taken together, awareness campaigns, the efficiency of one-to-many disclosures, and opportunities for anonymous lower-risk disclosures elsewhere contribute to women’s decisions to disclose pregnancy loss experiences on identified snss, which, through the mechanism of network-level reciprocation, creates an increasingly disclosure-friendly context for those who come after.",157
Conceptualizing Disagreement in Qualitative Coding,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655439,"collaborative qualitative coding often involves coders assign- ing different labels to the same instance, leading to ambiguity. we refer to such an instance of ambiguity as disagreement in coding. analyzing reasons for such a disagreement is essential-- both for purposes of bolstering user understanding gained from coding and reinterpreting the data collaboratively, and for negotiating user-assigned labels for building effective machine learning models. we propose a conceptual definition of collective disagreement using diversity and divergence within the coding distributions. this perspective of disagreement translates to diverse coding contexts and groups of coders irrespective of discipline. we introduce two tree-based ranking metrics as standardized ways of comparing disagreements in how data instances have been coded. we empirically validate that, of the two tree-based metrics, coders' perceptions of dis- agreement match more closely with the n-ary tree metric than with the post-traversal tree metric. human intuition for comparing across different states of disagreement can be severely challenged with increasing amounts of data to be coded and limited available resources for coding it. this is further complicated by coder bias when dealing with the complexity of disagreement [26]. however, a state of (dis)agreement is independent of the labels used for coding data instances. the paper presents a conceptual understanding of collaborative disagreement that remains indifferent to the coding context and groups of coders irrespective of their discipline. we use this conceptual formulation to offer tree-based ranking metrics that allow coders to order different states of coding disagreements to discern ambiguity. our proposed approach of dealing with disagreement treats all the labels uniformly, and remains unchanged with new coding schemes provided the number of unique labels is preserved. this agnostic property offers qualitative coders an opportunity to easily analyze disagreement, resolve minor disputes, single out irregular instances, and help improve coding of the data. with such properties, the metrics successfully represent ambiguous instances such that they match the coder’s perceptions of disagreement.",158
Intermodulation: Improvisation and Collaborative Art Practice for HCI,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655430,"this paper integrates theory, ethnography, and collaborative artwork to explore improvisational activity as both topic and tool of multidisciplinary hci inquiry. building on theories of improvisation drawn from art, music, hci and social science, and two ethnographic studies based on interviews, participant observation and collaborative art practice, we seek to elucidate the improvisational nature of practice in both art and ordinary action, including human-computer interaction. we identify five key features of improvisational action -- reflexivity, transgression, tension, listening, and interdependence -- and show how these can deepen and extend both linear and open-ended methodologies in hci and design. we conclude by highlighting collaborative engagement based on 'intermodulation' as a tool of multidisciplinary inquiry for hci research and design. this paper explores the value and possibility of improvisation and collective art practice as a mode of hci research and inquiry. as the theories and cases reviewed above make clear, the core engine that enables improvisation is neither a predetermined plan nor sheer extemporaneousness (or put simply, just ‘making stuff up’.). instead, it is enabled through processes of dialogue and intermodulation that continually arbitrate between freedom and structure, similarity and otherness, tension and relaxation, and self-conviction and external validity. from this complex and precarious interaction, the subject ‘i’ can be stimulated to emerge from his or her existing narrowness in the world, and develop creativity and knowledge in a mutually reciprocal way with others. this paper identifies five key features that enable such learning opportunities, and explain how these can deepen and extend notions of creativity and collaboration in hci and design. our work has attempted to provide one useful model of multidisciplinary research wherein musicians, artists, and hci researchers learn to come together – “to bend for the common result” – to achieve outcomes, insights and ideas unavailable to each individually.",159
OptiMo: Optimization-Guided Motion Editing for Keyframe Character Animation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655431,"the mission of animators is to create nuanced, high-quality character motions. to achieve this, the careful editing of animation curves---curves that determine how a series of keyframed poses are interpolated over time---is an important task. manual editing affords full and precise control, but requires tedious and nonintuitive trials and errors. numerical optimization can automate such exploration; however, automatic solutions cannot always be perfect, and it is difficult for animators to control optimization owing to its black-box behavior. in this paper, we present a new framework called optimization-guided motion editing, which is aimed at maintaining a sense of full control while utilizing the power of optimization. we have designed interactions and developed a set of mathematical formulations to enable them. we discuss the framework's potential by demonstrating several usage scenarios with our proof-of-concept system, named optimo. we presented a new framework called optimization-guided motion editing, in which numerical optimization is utilized as a tool for animators to effectively edit character motions. to enable this, we set the three design goals: editability of the optimized motion, controllability of the optimization behavior, and transparency of the optimization process. based on these goals, we presented a set of interactions and their mathematical formulations, and developed a proof-of-concept system, named optimo. we showed how this system could support animators by demonstrating several usage scenarios. to validate our approach, we interviewed domain experts using our system, and obtained comments for each feature of the system as well as its potential usages in the professional production.",160
Medley: A Library of Embeddables to Explore Rich Material Properties for 3D Printed Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655432,"in our everyday life, we interact with and benefit from objects with a wide range of material properties. in contrast, personal fabrication machines (e.g., desktop 3d printers) currently only support a much smaller set of materials. our goal is to close the gap between current limitations and the future of multi-material printing by enabling people to explore the reuse of material from everyday objects into their custom designs. to achieve this, we develop a library of embeddables--everyday objects that can be cut, worked and embedded into 3d printable designs. we describe a design space that characterizes the geometric and material properties of embeddables. we then develop medley---a design tool whereby users can import a 3d model, search for embeddables with desired material properties, and interactively edit and integrate their geometry to fit into the original design. medley also supports the final fabrication and embedding process, including instructions for carving or cutting the objects, and generating optimal paths for inserting embeddables. to validate the expressiveness of our library, we showcase numerous examples augmented by embeddables that go beyond the objects' original printed materials. to approximate a future of multi-material printing, we have constructed a library (and the tool support) of embeddables– everyday objects that can be cut, worked and embedded into 3d printed designs to augment their material properties. we hope this work can promote future research on end-user material literacy, as well as inspiring designers and makers to explore the material aspects of personal fabrication.",161
GeoCoin: Supporting Ideation and Collaborative Design with Smart Contracts,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655433,"design and hci researchers are increasingly working with complex digital infrastructures, such as cryptocurrencies, distributed ledgers and smart contracts. these technologies will have a profound impact on digital systems and their audiences. however, given their emergent nature and technical complexity, involving non-specialists in the design of applications that employ these technologies is challenging. in this paper, we discuss these challenges and present geocoin, a location-based platform for embodied learning and speculative ideating with smart contracts. in collaborative workshops with geocoin, participants engaged with location-based smart contracts, using the platform to explore digital 'debit' and 'credit' zones in the city. these exercises led to the design of diverse distributed-ledger applications, for time-limited financial unions, participatory budgeting, and humanitarian aid. these results contribute to the hci community by demonstrating how an experiential prototype can support understanding of the complexities behind new digital infrastructures and facilitate participant engagement in ideation and design processes. in this paper, we have introduced geocoin, an example of unfinished software aimed at creating a shared environment for speculative ideating and collaborative designing with locationbased smart contracts. we contribute to the hci community by developing the concept of unfinished software. in particular, we have used it to: • make smart contracts experientially accessible to nonspecialists. we have discussed how this experiential prototype can support non-specialists in understanding complex technological systems such as smart contracts. • explore values and concerns of smart contracts for smart cities. we have discussed insights from a series of geocoin workshops with a number of audiences ranging from arts organisations, artists, designers to academics, industry and blockchain experts. • allow participants to ideate with smart contracts. we have presented a series of design ideas emerging from the workshops which shows how geocoin facilitated participant engagement in ideation and design processes, through the concept of open, unfinished software. geocoin.site is freely available to hci researchers as a web platform for creating open geo-located smart contract experiences. more generally, we demonstrate how employing unfinished software platforms can engage non-specialist audiences in location-based value exchange and peer-to-peer systems in a way that is meaningful and empowering to them.",162
Evaluating Attack and Defense Strategies for Smartphone PIN Shoulder Surfing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655434,"we evaluate the efficacy of shoulder surfing defenses for pin-based authentication systems. we find tilting the device away from the observer, a widely adopted defense strategy, provides limited protection. we also evaluate a recently proposed defense incorporating an ""invisible pressure component"" into pin entry. contrary to earlier claims, our results show this provides little defense against malicious insider attacks. observations during the study uncover successful attacker strategies for reconstructing a victim's pin when faced with a tilt defense. our evaluations identify common misconceptions regarding shoulder surfing defenses, and highlight the need to educate users on how to safeguard their credentials from these attacks. we conducted experiments using 30 subjects to understand shoulder surfing defenses and attack strategies on smartphone pins. our experiments show that it is quite easy to correctly guess pins with two observations, on average. furthermore, attackers were surprisingly effective in shoulder surfing pins from across the room. we also subject the most commonly used defense, tilting the device screen away from the observer, to shoulder surfing attacks and show its limited efficacy. we show that while tilting the device screen away from the attacker with an angle of 70° or higher prevents complete guessing of pins, smart attackers look for other clues (such as the proximity of the finger to the corner of the smartphone) to partially guess the pin. finally, we conduct experiments and gather empirical evidence to show that forcepin has an inherent timing side channel, which renders it completely ineffective against shoulder surfing attacks. our work calls attention to educating users about the threat of shoulder surfing and common misconceptions. first, it shows that smartphone users need to be careful even when the observer is located across the room. second, while tilting the device screen may hide its contents, it does not prevent shoulder surfing attacks on pins. therefore, it is important to educate smartphone users on the inefficacy of this defense.",163
VR-OOM: Virtual Reality On-rOad driving siMulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655445,"researchers and designers of in-vehicle interactions and interfaces currently have to choose between performing evaluation and human factors experiments in laboratory driving simulators or on-road experiments. to enjoy the benefit of customizable course design in controlled experiments with the immediacy and rich sensations of on-road driving, we have developed a new method and tools to enable vr driving simulation in a vehicle as it travels on a road. in this paper, we describe how the cost-effective and flexible implementation of this platform allows for rapid prototyping. a preliminary pilot test (n = 6), centered on an autonomous driving scenario, yields promising results, illustrating proof of concept and indicating that a basic implementation of the system can invoke genuine responses from test participants. vr-oom is the first on-road vr driving simulator. the driving simulation environment features the controlled events and scenarios of traditional driving simulators with the physical sensations, immediacy and presence of actual driving. our initial validation tests indicate that it can serve functionally as a driving simulation environment for autonomous driving scenarios to test driver situation awareness and intervention. further validation studies are ongoing to ensure that this novel driving simulator can help bridge the gap between safe testing of human response and effective prediction of human performance. by using the system description and protocol described in this paper, researchers can have access to a highly immersive driving simulation environment for relatively low cost and effort. we hope this broadens the pool of people who will design future interactions and interfaces for automobiles, and encourage broader empirical testing to understand human response in the road ahead.",164
KickAR: Exploring Game Balancing Through Boosts and Handicaps in Augmented Reality Table Football,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655446,"when player skill levels are not matched, games provide an unsatisfying player experience. player balancing is used across many digital game genres to address this, but has not been studied for co-located augmented reality (ar) tabletop games, where using boosts and handicaps can adjust for different player skill levels. in the setting of an ar table football game, we studied the importance of game balancing being triggered by the game system or the players, and whether player skill should be required to trigger game balancing. we implemented projected icons to prominently display game balancing mechanics in the ar table football game. in a within-subjects study (n=24), we found players prefer skill-based control over game balancing and that different triggers are perceived as having different fairness. further, the study showed that even game balancing that is perceived as unfair can provide enjoyable game experiences. based on our findings, we provide suggestions for player balancing in ar tabletop games. co-located social games involving physical movement facilitate enjoyment and engagement. due to their frequent occurrence in diverse social settings, game balancing for skill mismatch is particularly important for these games. in this paper, we presented kickar, a custom-made arenhanced foosball table, to explore game balancing with boosts and handicaps. with this game table, we explored our research question on different triggers for this kind of game balancing, and their effects on player experience. in a within-subjects study, we compared system-based control to player-based control over the game balancing triggers, as well as the importance of designing for different types of player control: skill-based as opposed to non-game-related. in summary, our contribution consists of three main findings regarding the use of game balancing for ar table games: • players clearly prefer skill-based control over the game balancing triggers, rather than control by the game system or player control that is not tied to skill. • perceived fairness of game balancing does not necessarily impact the player experience. chi 2018 paper chi 2018, april 21–26, 2018, montréal, qc, canada paper 166 page 9 • the appearance of game balancing challenges alone already negatively affects players’ perceived competence, regardless of game interference. with these results in mind, ar table game designers can improve player experience and increase enjoyment in games that feature a disparity in skill levels. while these findings are particularly important for table games, future work will explore to what degree these findings generalize to team-vsteam gameplay, and video games with players that are not co-located.",165
Digital Joinery For Hybrid Carpentry,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655447,"the craft of carpentry relies on joinery: the connections between pieces of wood to create multipart structures. in traditional woodworking, joints are limited to the manual chisel skills of the craftsperson, or to capabilities of the machines, which favorite 90° or 180° angle joints with no more than two elements. we contribute an interactive design process in which joints are generated digitally to allow for unrestricted beam connectors, then produced from nylon-12 using selective laser sintering (sls) 3d printing. we present our generative joinery design tool and demonstrate our system on a selection of stools. the paper exemplifies the potential of digital joinery to enhance carpentry by incorporating a hybrid and interactive level of design sophistication and affordances that are very hard to achieve with traditional skills and tools. in this paper we presented digital joinery, a woodworking design paradigm aiming to liberate carpentry from traditional construction limitations. we contribute a new joinery design software tool that supports new types of connectors, to let multiple pieces of lumber meet at unconventional angles, manifesting a new type of aesthetics and structure for furniture. we demonstrated our tool in a collection of three stools, each of which illustrates a different aspect of new joints for stool making. our work aims at reinforcing the bridge that has already started to pave the way for makers, designers, and researchers to merge computational practices with craft [26,29]. in doing so, we continue the lines of prior work [36] aiming to keep computational design open and allow for some sort of manual freedom to encourage makers to explore the full potential of the hybrid medium. in addition to the technical work presented here, we discussed our work with professional carpenters and designers. the designers seemed a bit more open-minded about the affordances of such technology, envisioning a new type of human-computer interaction via the furniture design process. yet, as our work aims to assist craftpersons as well as designers, we believe that hybrid design tools may be most fruitful in the hands of hybrid makers. otherwise, a broader introduction is needed to expose traditional craftpersons to digital design and fabrication prior to training them to use digital joinery. considering future work, digital joinery can be extended to serve as a connecting agent between other ready-made artifacts (not just wood). moreover, we would like to extend the deployment of digital joinery to a diverse community of makers wishing for hybrid design prosperity. we envision future craftpersons equipped with manual and digital machines, mastering handwork and computational work. while this community of professional hybrid makers chi 2018 honourable mention chi 2018, april 21–26, 2018, montréal, qc, canada paper 167 page 9 already exists, more tools and technology for hybrid practice is required, and our work aims at this need. finally, and on a slightly different track, we would like to learn how digital joinery could personalize mass furniture manufacturing. for instance, given a warehouse with a huge amount of lumber in a finite set of dimensions and types, how can consumers interact with parametric and generative tools to customize their furniture? how can we optimize the use for this collection of raw material, yet maximize the design freedom of the end users? for example, let us assume a warehouse includes 4 cm x 4 cm wooden beams in lengths of 80 cm and 50 cm. when a customer requests a chair that will support a load of 100 kg, or a table in a specific dimension, the software will be able to generate an optimal or semi-optimal (using a minimal amount of wood) solution enabled by 3d-printed joints and an optimizing design algorithm. in addition, the user can specify a finished style and other details. this vision require extensive research on (1) finite-set catalog selection mechanisms integrated into generative design software; and (2) extended generative design procedures that optimize full furniture architecture for production, considering wood costs, 3d printing costs, and the system’s abilities. this will be the topic of our future research, and hopefully will interest other researchers in the hci and cg communities.",166
What Makes an Automated Vehicle a Good Driver?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655448,"an automated vehicle needs to learn how human road users experience the intentions of other drivers and understand how they communicate with each other in order to avoid misunderstandings and prevent giving a negative external image during interactions. the aim of the present study is to identify a cooperative lane change indication which other drivers understand unambiguously and prefer when it comes to lane change announcements in a dense traffic situation on the highway. a fixed-base driving simulator study is conducted with n = 66 participants in germany in a car-following scenario. participants rated, from the lag driver's perspective, different lane change announcements of another driver which varied in lateral movements (i.e., duration, lateral offset). main findings indicate that a medium offset and moderate duration of lateral movement is experienced as most cooperative. the results are crucial for the development of lane change strategies for automated vehicles. the study results extend the available literature in the following ways: current literature on modelling human lane change strategies, called gap acceptance models [2,8,14,19,23], only distinguish between courtesy and forced merging models. this implies that either the other vehicle is willing to allow a lane change or the driver has to enforce his/her desire but neglect the fact that a driver can actively announce a lane change desire without appearing reckless or too passive. therefore, the results of the study contribute to enhancing the current literature on human interaction behaviour in dense traffic situations. secondly, it represents a first approach when it comes to modelling the interaction between automated vehicles and human drivers in order to be unambiguously understood.",167
"Feel My Pain: Design and Evaluation of Painpad, a Tangible Device for Supporting Inpatient Self-Logging of Pain",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655449,"monitoring patients' pain is a critical issue for clinical caregivers, particularly among staff responsible for providing analgesic relief. however, collecting regularly scheduled pain readings from patients can be difficult and time-consuming for clinicians. in this paper we present painpad, a tangible device that was developed to allow patients to engage in self-logging of their pain. we report findings from two hospital-based field studies in which painpad was deployed to a total of 78 inpatients recovering from ambulatory surgery. we find that painpad results in improved frequency and compliance with pain logging, and that self-logged scores may be more faithful to patients' experienced pain than corresponding scores reported to nurses. we also show that older adults may prefer tangible interfaces over tablet-based alternatives for reporting their pain, and we contribute design lessons for pain logging devices intended for use in hospital settings. in this paper we presented painpad, a device that enables selflogging of pain by hospitalised patients. painpad was wellreceived by participants, and was shown to facilitate improved compliance compared to equivalent nurse scoring. allowing patients to self-score their pain circumvents the need for nurses to engage in burdensome data collection, and lowers the data management and processing time for clinicians [6, 13] by autopopulating each patient’s data into a secure database for use in research and service improvement. in future work, we plan to explore other input techniques for inpatient pain logging. the present work compared a device with physical buttons and two tablet alternatives, but one could conceivably create a device that incorporates a physical slider and compare this to a keypad alternative. likewise, unlock journaling [44] represents an alternative, low-effort method for collecting pain scores on mobile phones and tablets. beyond this, it is worth noting that the pain data collected in our study did not factor into clinical decision-making, yet could easily do so in future. we plan to allow nurses to monitor the pain curve of multiple patients from the convenience of the nurse’s station, combining self-logged data with live pain monitoring interfaces to support decision making. similarly, logging pain scores alongside analgesic dosing times might allow clinicians to identify correlations and make better decisions based on real-time data collected about their patients.",168
Challenges and Opportunities for Technology-Supported Activity Reporting in the Workplace,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655440,"effective communication of activities and progress in the workplace is crucial for the success of many modern organizations. in this paper, we extend current research on workplace communication and uncover opportunities for technology to support effective work activity reporting. we report on three studies: with a survey of 68 knowledge workers followed by 14 in-depth interviews, we investigated the perceived benefits of different types of progress reports and an array of challenges at three stages: collection, composition, and delivery. we show an important interplay between written and face-to-face reporting, and highlight the importance of tailoring a report to its audience. we then present results from an analysis of 722 reports composed by 361 u.s.-based knowledge workers, looking at the influence of the audience on a report's language. we conclude by discussing opportunities for future technologies to assist both employees and managers in collecting, interpreting, and reporting progress in the workplace. we presented results from a mixed-methods investigation of activity reporting in the workplace. our survey and interviews highlighted challenges with recalling, composing and delivering reports, and uncovered the prevalence of communicating progress across multiple channels. our corpus of real-world weekly reports highlighted the ways in which people tailored reports differently based on presumed audience. as activity reporting continues to be an important means of achieving workplace awareness, our work provides insight into promising areas in which technology can support the power dynamic between workers and managers. we highlight opportunities for researchers and designers to further streamline the process of recording activity for different audiences, across multiple places and channels, so that the outcomes can benefit all stakeholders.",169
Supporting Meaningful Personal Fitness: the Tracker Goal Evolution Model,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655441,"while the number of users sporting fitness trackers is constantly increasing, little is understood about how tracking goals can evolve over time. as recent studies have shown that the long-term health effects of trackers are limited, we need to readdress how trackers engage users. we conducted semi-structured interviews and an online survey to explore how users change their tracking goals. based on our results, we created the tracker goal evolution model. the model describes how tracker goals can evolve from internal user needs through qualitative goals to quantitative goals that can be used with trackers. it also includes trust and reflection as key contextual factors contributing to meaningful transitions between goals. we postulate showing how tracker goals relate to other personal fitness goals as key for long-term engagement with trackers. our model is useful for designers of future trackers as a tool to create evolving and meaningful tracking goals. in this paper, we introduced the tracker goal evolution model. our model describes the user practices around fitness tracker goals on three levels: hedonic and eudaimonic needs, qualitative goals and quantitative goals. these three levels are connected with two transitions: manifestation and translation. we based our model on a series of semi-structured interviews and an online survey. our model enables charting an individual’s goals in order to build more engaging and evolving tracking experiences. the model can be used as a complement to models of personal informatics as it offers a new perspective on how a user’s goals evolve through the journey through personal tracking. we hope that our work will help researchers and designers address new challenges with personal tracking and build trackers that offer long-term benefits. our model aims to contribute to a new generation of trackers that offer engaging experiences and tangible benefits. in future work, we hope to investigate how it can help generate alternative designs for fitness trackers and ways to communicate its levels and transitions to the user in a meaningful way.",170
Everybody's Hacking: Participation and the Mainstreaming of Hackathons,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655442,"hackathons have become a popular tool for bringing people together to imagine new possibilities for technology. despite originating in technology communities, hackathons have now been widely adopted by a broad range of organisations. this mainstreaming of hackathons means they encompass a very different range of attendees and activities than they once did, to the extent that some events billed as hackathons may involve no coding at all. given this shift away from production of code, they might instead be seen as an increasingly popular participatory design activity, from which designers and researchers in hci can learn. through fieldwork at six hackathons that targeted non-technical communities, we identify the types of activities and contributions that emerge through these events and the barriers and tensions that might exist. in doing so, we contribute a greater understanding of hackathons as a growing phenomenon and as a potential tool for participatory research. in this paper, we have explored the ongoing mainstreaming of hackathons from a largely technical pursuit into participatory events that engage with a much wider audience. we have shown the motivations for organisers in running these events, the ways in which people are able to participate without coding, and the tensions that arise between the hackathon format and the desire for wider participation. we believe that the popularity experienced by these events poses many opportunities for participatory research, both in terms of repurposing hackathons themselves and in informing the configuration of other participatory research activities. future work will need to focus on how new types of activity can be configured while also avoiding some of the acknowledged inclusion pitfalls of hackathons. however, despite these challenges, there is clear potential for engaging people with the design of technologies in new ways.",171
Pointing at a Distance with Everyday Smart Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655443,"large displays are becoming commonplace at work, at home, or in public areas. however, interaction at a distance -- anything greater than arms-length -- remains cumbersome, restricts simultaneous use, and requires specific hardware augmentations of the display: touch layers, cameras, or dedicated input devices. yet a rapidly increasing number of people carry smartphones and smartwatches, devices with rich input capabilities that can easily be used as input devices to control interactive systems. we contribute (1) the results of a survey on possession and use of smart devices, and (2) the results of a controlled experiment comparing seven distal pointing techniques on phone or watch, one- and two-handed, and using different input channels and mappings. our results favor using a smartphone as a trackpad, but also explore performance tradeoffs that can inform the choice and design of distal pointing techniques for different contexts of use. our work investigates the use of handheld devices, the smartphone and the smartwatch, as remote pointing devices to interact with large displays. we first explore the design space for high-level dimensions and describe the implementation of 7 feasible techniques. through a controlled pointing study, we suggest the use of the smartphone as a relative trackpad, utilizing landscape orientation and two hands for best performance. we then explore design challenges and offer alternative recommendations for dimensionally-constrained contexts such as when one or both hands are unavailable for use. most importantly, our work demonstrates the sensor and touch capabilities of modern smart devices allow for rich, flexible, and alwaysavailable interactions, which can be dynamically adjusted for real-world contexts without expensive and rigid augmentations to the environment or the large display.",172
The Story in the Notebook: Exploratory Data Science using a Literate Programming Tool,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N655444,"literate programming tools are used by millions of programmers today, and are intended to facilitate presenting data analyses in the form of a narrative. we interviewed 21 data scientists to study coding behaviors in a literate programming environment and how data scientists kept track of variants they explored. for participants who tried to keep a detailed history of their experimentation, both informal and formal versioning attempts led to problems, such as reduced notebook readability. during iteration, participants actively curated their notebooks into narratives, although primarily through cell structure rather than markdown explanations. next, we surveyed 45 data scientists and asked them to envision how they might use their past history in an future version control system. based on these results, we give design guidance for future literate programming tools, such as providing history search based on how programmers recall their explorations, through contextual details including images and parameters. data scientists from a broad range of domains and skill levels are doing impactful work through code. in this study of literate programming we found that programmers do create narrative structure during their exploration, although often by manipulating cell structure rather than using much explanatory markdown. creating a narrative also intersects and conflicts with other objectives, such as participants who prototyped and debugged code by expanding-reducing cell structure, or participants who kept a clutter of old iterations in their notebooks to retain a history of their work. we hope our results will inspire future designs for ways to interact with notebook cells for browsing history, debugging, and other tasks which may improve the effectiveness of literate programming for supporting data science.",173
What Did I Really Vote For?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656555,"e-voting has been embraced by a number of countries, delivering benefits in terms of efficiency and accessibility. end-to-end verifiable e-voting schemes facilitate verification of the integrity of individual votes during the election process. in particular, methods for cast-as-intended verification enable voters to confirm that their cast votes have not been manipulated by the voting client. a well-known technique for effecting cast-as-intended verification is the benaloh challenge. the usability of this challenge is crucial because voters have to be actively engaged in the verification process. in this paper, we report on a usability evaluation of three different approaches of the benaloh challenge in the remote e-voting context. we performed a comparative user study with 95 participants. we conclude with a recommendation for which approaches should be provided to afford verification in real-world elections and suggest usability improvements. based on our usability evaluation, we recommend the mobile approach for deployment during elections. many of the problems that participants reported in the questionnaire could be mitigated by improved implementations. however, the mobile approach’s use is limited to supplementary device owners (e.g. a smartphone), of which there were only 78% in germany, according to the latest survey [46]. therefore, for greater inclusivity we recommend offering the automatic approach as a fall-back. the automatic approach can serve as an alternative for those who do not own smartphones. it has to be acknowledged, however, that the verification data is no longer displayed to the voter in the automatic and mobile approaches. as already proposed by karayumak et al. [32], the verification data should still be available in an auxiliary expert mode. expert voters can then conduct manual verification, perhaps by using their own programmed verifier.",174
Tangible Drops: A Visio-Tactile Display Using Actuated Liquid-Metal Droplets,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656556,"we present tangible drops, a visio-tactile display that for the first time provides physical visualization and tactile feedback using a planar liquid interface. it presents digital information interactively by tracing dynamic patterns on horizontal flat surfaces using liquid metal drops on a programmable electrode array. it provides tactile feedback with directional information in the 2d vector plane using linear locomotion and/or vibration of the liquid metal drops. we demonstrate move, oscillate, merge, split and dispense-from-reservoir functions of the liquid metal drops by consuming low power (450 mw per electrode) and low voltage (8--15 v). we report on results of our empirical study with 12 participants on tactile feedback using 8 mm diameter drops, which indicate that tangible drops can convey tactile sensations such as changing speed, varying direction and controlled oscillation with no visual feedback. we present the design space and demonstrate the applications of tangible drops, and conclude by suggesting potential future applications for the technique. we have presented tangible drops, which can produce visual animations on a flat surface using locomotion of liquid metal droplets. the enabling technology for the novel user experience that it provides is tactile feedback with 2d planar direction information using a liquid material. it demonstrates, for the first time, the locomotion of liquid metal drops from electrode to electrode on an open surface without constraining channels or cells. it also demonstrates for the first time a combination of locomotion and vibration of a material to provide tactile feedback. while this work is still in its prototype stage, we have shown it to be a viable new method of controlling liquid metal alloys for visio-tactile displays, and have therefore laid the foundations for what we hope to be a rich and full area of future work in the area.",175
FingerT9: Leveraging Thumb-to-finger Interaction for Same-side-hand Text Entry on Smartwatches,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656557,"we introduce fingert9, leveraging the action of thumb-to-finger touching on the finger segments, to support same-side-hand (ssh) text entry on smartwatches. this is achieved by mapping a t9 keyboard layout to the finger segments. our solution avoids the problems of fat finger and screen occlusion, and enables text entry using the same-side hand which wears the watch. in the pilot study, we determined the layout mapping preferred by the users. we conducted an experiment to compare the text-entry performances of fingert9, the tilt-based ssh input, and the direct-touch non-ssh input. the results showed that the participants performed significantly faster and more accurately with fingert9 than the tilt-based method. there was no significant difference between fingert9 and direct-touch methods in terms of efficiency and error rate. we then conducted the second experiment to study the learning curve on ssh text entry methods: fingert9 and the tilt-based input. fingert9 gave significantly better long-term improvement. in addition, eyes-free text entry (i.e., looking at the screen output but not the keyboard layout mapped on the finger segments) was made possible once the participants were familiar with the keyboard layout. we introduced fingert9, a novel ssh text-entry approach for smartwatch, combining traditional t9 keyboard and thumb-to-finger interaction. we implemented an experimental prototype with the thin-film capacitive sensors attached on the finger segments. the within-subject controlled experiment showed that fingert9 has significant faster typing speed and lower error rate than the ssh tilt-based input, and has lower error compared with the traditional direct-touch input. experiment ii showed that fingert9 has significant improvement than the tilt-based input over time and users could remember the fingert9 layout. the two experiments revealed that fingert9 performed better than tilt-based input in text entry speed, error rate, efficiency, and learnability. these advantages of fingert9 over the tilt-based method could be due to the simplified typing procedure (i.e. eliminating the step of letter selection) and the reduced physical efforts. in the future, we would like to optimize the keyboard layout, and improve the prototype of thumb-to-finger touch sensing ability by attempting possible finger sensing approaches through tracking finger movement with high resolution electrical impedance tomography (eit). we will investigate ssh smartwatch text entry in more depth with text entry in specific context (such as, walking, standing, and hand holding something), study the performance of ssh text entry with dominant and non-dominant hands and its social acceptance to see how practical ssh smartwatch text entry is in everyday life. besides, we are interested in exploring fingert9 for other language text entry, such as chinese, japanese, and korean, and investigate how it could be applied for eyes-free typing.",176
Time-Turner: Designing for Reflection and Remembrance of Moments in the Home,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656558,"families preserve memories of their special and everyday experiences, though it can be hard to capture all these moments in everyday life. we explore the concept of automated forms of capturing family life and presenting them through situated, tangible everyday artifacts in the home. we designed time-turner, an always-on video recording system along with a set of three drink coasters that allow family members to easily search, filter and replay videos to connect to their past. we engaged households in speculative enactments and interviews to explore the design space. our findings point to the value of witnessing real rather than staged moments and the ways in which the affordances of everyday artifacts can allow media to be 'lived with' as a part of everyday life. yet our design also revealed tensions around sharing and changing perceptions across time and generations. this points to design challenges around safeguarding this media and capturing 'reality' as opposed to curated content. we designed time-turner to critically explore how digital memories might be captured through an always-on video recording system and then embedded in everyday objects in the home for supporting family practices around reflecting and remembering the past. our findings revealed the opportunities, possibilities, and the tensions of this new paradigm of capturing and playing back family life. we provide new insights on how always-on video systems in the home can open opportunities for households to construct value with video archives as well as the social tensions that could emerge. future work should explore non-western ways of accessing time and include a range of family members (kids, grandparents). our work provides an example of new kinds of connected devices that can automate aspects of our lives while helping to fit within the social fabric of domestic life and home environments.",177
Webcam Covering as Planned Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656559,"most of today's laptops come with an integrated webcam placed above the screen to enable video conferencing. due to the risk of webcam spying attacks, some laptop users seem to be concerned about their privacy and seek protection by covering the webcam. this paper is the first to investigate personal characteristics and beliefs of users with and without webcam covers by applying the theory of planned behavior. we record the privacy behavior of 180 users, develop a path model, and analyze it by applying partial least squares. the analysis indicates that privacy concerns do not significantly influence users' decision to use a webcam cover. rather, this behavior is influenced by users' attitudes, social environment, and perceived control over protecting privacy. developers should take this as a lesson to design privacy enhancing technologies which are convenient, verifiably effective and endorsed by peers. this study is the first to investigate laptop users’ webcam covering behavior by applying the theory of planned behavior. our field data collection at public places enabled us to unobtrusively observe this privacy protection behavior as a special kind of human-machine interaction. about a third of the study participants used a webcam cover. we use pls analysis to fit a latent factor path model to understand the drivers that lead users to adopt or abstain from covering their webcam. users perform this behavior largely independent of their stated level of privacy concerns, but rather because of specific beliefs regarding webcam covers. we find that users are heterogeneous in these beliefs. as a consequence, developers should take our results as a lesson on the importance of designing privacy enhancing technologies which are perceived as convenient, effective and socially acceptable.",178
WrisText: One-handed Text Entry on Smartwatch using Wrist Gestures,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656550,"we present wristext - a one-handed text entry technique for smartwatches using the joystick-like motion of the wrist. a user enters text by whirling the wrist of the watch hand, towards six directions which each represent a key in a circular keyboard, and where the letters are distributed in an alphabetical order. the design of wristext was an iterative process, where we first conducted a study to investigate optimal key size, and found that keys needed to be 55º or wider to achieve over 90% striking accuracy. we then computed an optimal keyboard layout, considering a joint optimization problem of striking accuracy, striking comfort, word disambiguation. we evaluated the performance of wristext through a five-day study with 10 participants in two text entry scenarios: hand-up and hand-down. on average, participants achieved a text entry speed of 9.9 wpm across all sessions, and were able to type as fast as 15.2 wpm by the end of the last day. in this paper, we proposed, designed, and studied a onehanded text entry technique on smartwatches. the technique allows users to enter text using the same hand wearing the smartwatch, by whirling the wrist in six directions to select letters in a circular keyboard. we designed the layout of the keyboard in an iterative approach, where we first studied the optimal size of the keyboard keys, and found that keys needed to be 55º or wider to achieve over 90% striking accuracy. we then optimized the keyboard layout by considering factors, including keyboard learnability, striking accuracy, striking comfort, and word disambiguation. this led to a final design which was evaluated in a 5-day study with 10 participants. the result indicates that participants could achieve an average text entry speed of 9.9 wpm across all the sessions, and were able to type as fast as 15.2 wpm in the last day. we believe smartwatches will become the major platform for mobile text entry, and our technique may serve as important groundwork for future work on new text entry techniques for wearable devices.",179
Off-Line Sensing: Memorizing Interactions in Passive 3D-Printed Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656551,"embedding sensors into objects allow them to recognize various interactions. however, sensing usually requires active electronics that are often costly, need time to be assembled, and constantly draw power. thus, we propose off-line sensing: passive 3d-printed sensors that detect one-time interactions, such as accelerating or flipping, but neither require active electronics nor power at the time of the interaction. they memorize a pre-defined interaction via an embedded structure filled with a conductive medium (e.g., a liquid). whether a sensor was exposed to the interaction can be read-out via a capacitive touchscreen. sensors are printed in a single pass on a consumer-level 3d printer. through a series of experiments, we show the feasibility of off-line sensing. this paper has presented off-line sensing: a set of sensors that memorize pre-defined interaction via embedded 3d-printed structures filled with a conductive medium. using off-line sensing, we contribute a variety of off-line sensors that sense load, pressure, acceleration, tilt, flip over, and temperature. whether an object was exposed to the interaction can be readout via placing it on a standard capacitive touchscreen. using a consumer-level fabrication pipeline, off-line sensors can be easily created, printed and used. future work should address more advanced (e.g., continuous) interactions and further applications, where it is beneficial to deploy off-line sensors.",180
Social Computing-Driven Activism in Youth Empowerment Organizations: Challenges and Opportunities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656552,"throughout the world, organizations empower youth to participate in civic engagement to impact social change, and adult-youth collaborations are instrumental to the success of such initiatives. however, little is known about how technology supports this activism work, despite the fact that tools such as social networking applications (snas) are increasingly being leveraged in such contexts. we report results from a qualitative study of sna use within a youth empowerment organization. using the analytical lens of object-oriented publics, our findings reveal opportunities and challenges that youth and staff face when they use snas. we describe the illegibility of youth outreach efforts on snas, and how this illegibility complicated staff attempts to hold youth accountable. we also characterize how youth and staff differed in what they felt were socially appropriate uses of sna features, and tensions that arose in the co-use of these tools. we conclude with implications for the design of collaborative technologies that support youth-led activism in organizational contexts. through a qualitative study, we investigated the practices of an organization engaged in youth-led community organizing. our findings shed light on the ways in which snas mediated the work that youth and adults did, as well as their relationships with one another. we further discussed challenges that arose as staff strove to hold youth accountable for their outreach work. additional tensions resulted from the gap between adults' perception of how youth (should) use snas for their work and the actual challenges that youth face. using our findings, we present recommendations for how new icts could be designed to support youth-adult collaborations and the shifting attachments to issues amongst youth and their peers.",181
AdaM: Adapting Multi-User Interfaces for Collaborative Environments in Real-Time,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656553,"developing cross-device multi-user interfaces (uis) is a challenging problem. there are numerous ways in which content and interactivity can be distributed. however, good solutions must consider multiple users, their roles, their preferences and access rights, as well as device capabilities. manual and rule-based solutions are tedious to create and do not scale to larger problems nor do they adapt to dynamic changes, such as users leaving or joining an activity. in this paper, we cast the problem of ui distribution as an assignment problem and propose to solve it using combinatorial optimization. we present a mixed integer programming formulation which allows real-time applications in dynamically changing collaborative settings. it optimizes the allocation of ui elements based on device capabilities, user roles, preferences, and access rights. we present a proof-of-concept designer-in-the-loop tool, allowing for quick solution exploration. finally, we compare our approach to traditional paper prototyping in a lab study. in this paper we have demonstrated a scalable approach to the automatic assignment of ui elements to users and devices in cross-device user interfaces, during multi-user events. by posing this problem as an assignment problem, we were able to create an algorithm which adapts to dynamic changes due to altering configurations of users, their roles, their preferences and access rights, as well as advertised device capabilities. underpinning adam, is a milp solver which given an objective function decides the assignment of elements to multiple devices and users. measures for both quality, completeness along with constraints, help to guide the optimization toward satisfactory solutions, which are represented by suitable assignments of ui elements. following this, the layout problem is performed by responsive design practices common in web design, as shown in our application scenarios. the adam application platform itself is web-based and enables collaborative prototyping and rapid iterations of adam applications. in addition, our simulator environment allows us to instantiate a wide range of simulated devices. we report on scenarios with up to 1000 users and 2200 devices along with a user study involving six participants, who are asked to assign and adapt ui-element configurations. our qualitative results indicate that adam can reduce both designer and user effort in attaining ideal dui configurations. the results are promising and suggest further exploration is warranted into the automatic ui element assignment approach introduced here. the mathematical formulation introduced here may be extended to incorporate other issues present in collaborative multi-user interfaces including, extended device parameterization, social acceptability factors, user attention, proxemic dimensions, display switching, display contiguity, field of view, spatio-temporal interaction flow, inter-device consistency, sequential and parallel device use along with synchronous and asynchronous device arrangements.",182
SymbiosisSketch: Combining 2D & 3D Sketching for Designing Detailed 3D Objects in Situ,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656554,"we present symbiosissketch, a hybrid sketching system that combines drawing in air (3d) and on a drawing surface (2d) to create detailed 3d designs of arbitrary scale in an augmented reality (ar) setting. symbiosissketch leverages the complementary affordances of 3d (immersive, unconstrained, life-sized) and 2d (precise, constrained, ergonomic) interactions for in situ 3d conceptual design. a defining aspect of our system is the ongoing creation of surfaces from unorganized collections of 3d curves. these surfaces serve a dual purpose: as 3d canvases to map strokes drawn on a 2d tablet, and as shape proxies to occlude the physical environment and hidden curves in a 3d sketch. symbiosissketch users draw interchangeably on a 2d tablet or in 3d within an ergonomically comfortable canonical volume, mapped to arbitrary scale in ar. our evaluation study shows this hybrid technique to be easy to use in situ and effective in transcending the creative potential of either traditional sketching or drawing in air. symbiosissketch is a hybrid system aiming to blend design knowledge and expertise from the traditional 2d sketching domain to the new and exciting world of direct 3d sketching in ar/vr. by devising a novel method for defining constrained drawing canvases in 3d and building tools to support interaction with physical objects, we have built a system for 3d conceptual design in situ. our user evaluation confirmed that our toolset is useful, effective, and is able to support a variety of design tasks for users with diverse artistic backgrounds. we hope that this work guides future research in visual communication, furthering our ability to efficiently transform mental design concepts into digital models.",183
Video Game Selection Procedures For Experimental Research,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656565,"videogames are complex stimuli, and selecting games that consistently induce a desired player experience (px) in an experimental setting can be challenging. the number of relatively high-quality games being released each year continues to increase, which makes deriving a shortlist of plausible candidate games from this pool increasingly problematic. despite this, guidance for structuring and reporting on the game selection process remains limited. this paper therefore proposes two approaches to game selection: the first leverages online videogame databases and existing px research, and is structured with respect to widely-applicable videogame metadata. the second process applies established game design theory to serve researchers when insufficient connections between desired px outcomes and recognisable game elements exist. both methods are accompanied by example reports of their application. the present work aims to assist experimental researchers in selecting videogames likely to meet their needs, while encouraging more rigorous standards of reporting in the field. this paper has proposed two approaches to videogame selection in experimental px research. the first, based on videogame metadata, can quickly and accurately remove large numbers of games from consideration, and is bestsuited to studies with strong theoretical connections to existing px research. the second approach, based on the mda framework, provides a means for researchers to derive a list of game elements likely to support a desired experience – and a corresponding set of appropriate games – when existing literature is less readily applicable. example applications of both methods demonstrate that reporting the selection process clarifies the relationship between candidate games and research goals. rigour in designing and reporting videogame research is crucial for study replication and the credibility of the field; both would make funding px research a more viable prospect.",184
Animated Edge Textures in Node-Link Diagrams: a Design Space and Initial Evaluation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656566,"network edge data attributes are usually encoded using color, opacity, stroke thickness and stroke pattern, or some combination thereof. in addition to these static variables, it is also possible to animate dynamic particles flowing along the edges. this opens a larger design space of animated edge textures, featuring additional visual encodings that have potential not only in terms of visual mapping capacity but also playfulness and aesthetics. such animated edge textures have been used in several commercial and design-oriented visualizations, but to our knowledge almost always in a relatively ad hoc manner. we introduce a design space and web-based framework for generating animated edge textures, and report on an initial evaluation of particle properties - particle speed, pattern and frequency - in terms of visual perception.",185
Silicone Devices: A Scalable DIY Approach for Fabricating Self-Contained Multi-Layered Soft Circuits using Microfluidics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656567,"we present a scalable do-it-yourself (diy) fabrication workflow for prototyping highly stretchable yet robust devices using a co2 laser cutter, which we call silicone devices. silicone devices are self-contained and thus embed components for input, output, processing, and power. our approach scales to arbitrary complex devices as it supports techniques to make multi-layered stretchable circuits and buried vias. additionally, high-frequency signals are supported as our circuits consist of liquid metal and are therefore highly conductive and durable. to enable makers and interaction designers to prototype a wide variety of silicone devices, we also contribute a stretchable sensor toolkit, consisting of touch, proximity, sliding, pressure, and strain sensors. we demonstrate the versatility and novel opportunities of our technique by prototyping various samples and exploring their use cases. strain tests report on the reliability of our circuits and preliminary user feedback reports on the user-experience of our workflow by non-engineers. in this paper, we presented a scalable and accessible diy fabrication approach for making silicone devices. these devices are highly stretchable, and seamlessly embed all components for sensing, processing, and powering the circuit. our diy approach scales to arbitrarly complex devices as it supports multi-layered circuits which are interconnected using stretchable buried vias. circuit traces use galinstan as conductors in tiny micro-fluidic channels. galinstan has superior conductive properties and maintains it conductive performance while stretching. hence, silicone devices always self heal after stretching. to enable makers and interaction designers to prototype a wide variety of silicone devices, we also demonstrated how to make basic stretchable input sensors, including a highly reliable strain sensor, using our approach. we demonstrated the versatility and novel opportunities of our technique by prototyping a diverse set of samples and exploring their use cases. finally, strain tests report on the reliability of our circuits and preliminary user feedback reports on the user-experience of our workflow by non-engineers.",186
RFIBricks: Interactive Building Blocks Based on RFID,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656568,"we present rfibricks, an interactive building block system based on ultrahigh frequency radio-frequency identification (rfid) sensing. the system enables geometry resolution based on a simple yet highly generalizable mechanism: an rfid contact switch, which is made by cutting each rfid tag into two parts, namely antenna and chip. a magnetic connector is then coupled with each part. when the antenna and chip connect, an interaction event with an id is transmitted to the reader. on the basis of our design of rfid contact switch patterns, we present a system of interactive physical building blocks that resolves the stacking order and orientation when one block is stacked upon another, determines a three-dimensional (3d) geometry built on a two-dimensional base plate, and detects user inputs by incorporating electromechanical sensors. because it is calibration-free and does not require batteries in each block, it facilitates straightforward maintenance when deployed at scale. compared with other approaches, this rfid-based system resolves several critical challenges in human-computer interaction, such as 1) determining the identity and the built 3d geometry of passive building blocks, 2) enabling stackable token+constraint interaction on a tabletop, and 3) tracking in-hand assembly. this paper presents rfibricks, a lightweight and reliable interactive building block system based on uhf rfid sensing. this simple yet effective physical design transforms an rfid tag into an rfid contact switch and therefore enables the localization of the tag in 3d using a 2d grid of rfid contact switches. the proposed sensing algorithm effectively enables resolution of the 3d position and orientations of building blocks as well as the assembled geometry. the interactivity can be further enhanced by connecting the rfid contact switches with other electromechanical sensors to support more vibrant tangible and embodied interaction. the system evaluation addresses the limitations and design opportunities of our prototype system, which lays a foundation for further investigation of interactive tangible interaction platforms involving physical building blocks.",187
Let Me Be Implicit: Using Motive Disposition Theory to Predict and Explain Behaviour in Digital Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656569,"we introduce explicit and implicit motives (i.e., achievement, affiliation, power, autonomy) into player experience research and situate them in existing theories of player motivation, personality, playstyle, and experience. additionally, we conducted an experiment with 109 players in a social play situation and show that: 1. as expected, there are several correlations of playstyle, personality, and motivation with explicit motives, but few with implicit motives; 2. the implicit affiliation motive predicts in-game social behaviour; and 3. the implicit affiliation motive adds significant variance to explain regression models of in-game social behaviours even when we control for social aspects of personality, the explicit affiliation motive, self-esteem, and social player traits. our results support that implicit motives explain additional variance because they access needs that are experienced affectively and pre-consciously, and not through cognitive interpretation necessary for explicit expression and communication, as is the case in any approaches that use self-report. understanding the choices that players make and the behaviours that they exhibit in games are two of the central goals of player experience research. in this paper, we introduce motive disposition theory as a new lens for understanding players, contrast the use of explicit and implicit motives with existing player experience methods, and demonstrate that the implicit affiliation motive can predict behaviour in a social play setting, even when controlling for explicitly-accessed social constructs of play style, personality, and motivation. our results demonstrate the utility of implicit motives in player experience research as they access affective preferences, not conscious ones. we discuss how explicit motives explain the choices that we consciously make, but implicit motives describe the aspects of our experiences that bring us pleasure – both notions that are relevant to play. motive disposition theory – and implicit motives in particular – bring a valuable new perspective and set of assessment tools that can help us better understand players, the choices that they make, and what drives their behaviour in digital games.",188
Single or Multiple Conversational Agents?: An Interactional Coherence Comparison,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656560,"chatbots focusing on a narrow domain of expertise are in great rise. as several tasks require multiple expertise, a designer may integrate multiple chatbots in the background or include them as interlocutors in a conversation. we investigated both scenarios by means of a wizard of oz experiment, in which participants talked to chatbots about visiting a destination. we analyzed the conversation content, users' speech, and reported impressions. we found no significant difference between single- and multi-chatbots scenarios. however, even with equivalent conversation structures, users reported more confusion in multi-chatbots interactions and adopted strategies to organize turn-taking. our findings indicate that implementing a meta-chatbot may not be necessary, since similar conversation structures occur when interacting to multiple chatbots, but different interactional aspects must be considered for each scenario. this paper compared users’ behaviors when interacting with single or multiple chatbots to gather information for decision-making. human participants reported different communication experience, but the conversation structure remained similar between conditions. more specifically, users reported feeling more confused in multi-chatbots interactions, where they tried to adopt strategies to organize turn-taking. also, we found that the conversational agents’ proactive behaviors disrupt sequential coherence, but also help users to explore a knowledge database; hence, proactive behavior should be developed with a well-defined protocol that reduces disruptive messages. our results suggest that when designing a conversational agent to help users make decisions, there is no evident reason to split the knowledge amongst more than one agent. therefore, it is possible to leverage already available conversational agents and combine their knowledge to build a richer database. in this case, designers can choose between: a meta-chatbot user interface that orchestrates multiple agents in the background and overrides the multi-party aspect of interaction; or a multi-chatbot user interface with a well-defined interactional protocol that reduces stimuli overload. in both cases, designers should consider the importance of providing clues on how to explore chatbots’ knowledge, but also avoid sequential coherence disruption caused by unimportant messages.",189
Understanding the Use and Impact of the Zero-Rated Free Basics Platform in South Africa,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656561,"companies are offering zero-rated, or data-charge free internet services to help bring unconnected users online where internet access is less affordable. however, it is unclear whether these services achieve this goal or how they shape internet use. to inform evidence-based policy around and the design of zero-rated services, we show in this paper how mobile users are making use of facebook's controversial free basics platform. we present findings from interviews of 35 free basics users in south africa: current low-income users and non-regular student users. our findings suggest that free basics does shape internet usage, for instance, users spend more time online because of 'free' apps. second, free basics saves users money but adoption of the platform depends on access to other 'free' internet options. finally, most users are confused about how zero-rated services work and what 'free' means. based on our findings, we make recommendations for future work. zero-rated services are increasingly being used to connect low-income and unconnected users around the globe to the internet. our findings suggest that first, free basics does shape users’ internet use and their choices of which online services to use. users can get online more frequently and are driven to use ‘free’ services especially when they have fewer resources to get online. second, the impact of zero-rated services is highest on the lowest income users but can be a supplemental help to more well resourced users who need to get online. finally, users find the concept of zero-rating confusing which complicates the process of managing mobile internet costs. we suggest that zero-rated platforms give users agency to influence what is included in these platforms and a voice about the impact of these services on them. we also suggest that alternative models of zero-rating be examined for comparative impact assessment. lastly, we suggest more interface design work is needed to help users form an improved mental model of zero-rated services.",190
Cooperating to Compete: the Mutuality of Cooperation and Competition in Boardgame Play,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656562,"this paper examines the complex relationship between competition and cooperation in boardgame play. we understand boardgaming as distributed cognition, where people work together in a shared activity to accomplish the game. although players typically compete against each other, this competition is only possible through ongoing cooperation to negotiate, enact and maintain the rules of play. in this paper, we report on a study of people playing modern boardgames. we analyse how knowledge of the game's state is distributed amongst the players and the game components, and examine the different forms of cooperation and collaboration that occur during play. further, we show how players use the material elements of the game to support articulation work and to improve their awareness and understanding of the game's state. our goal is to examine the coordinative practices that the players use during play and explicate the ways in which these enable competition. in this paper, we have explored the complex relationship between cooperation and competition in boardgame play. using the lens of distributed cognition, we have demonstrated that forms of cooperation occur not only in overtly cooperative games but also in competitive games, and that they are found in both teaching situations and in the play of those with considerable experience in the game. cooperation is necessary to enable the artificial conflicts within the game, and takes many forms – it is not limited simply to articulation activities. essentially, cooperation occurs not only between the players themselves; the game components play an important role. boardgame play is a form of cooperative work that is situated, embodied, distributed and articulated. as we have shown, the play of a game encompasses complex relationships between the players and the material game components. at times, this extends to allowing the players to renegotiate rules, for example in allowing a player to change their selected action (vignette 5). not only are the components used to enact the game, they are also used by the players in epistemic tasks of sorting and ordering (v6). these tasks help players to remember key information as well as to plan for their future actions, allowing them to offload key cognitive work onto the components, and to observe the state of the game (v2, v3, v6). in some cases, the tasks are prescribed by the game rules to control how the components are used to manage information; in others, they are formulated and introduced by the players themselves to simplify or clarify gameplay, either in the form of a negotiated rule or as an imposed convention. an example of this is v4; julie’s insistence that max place his chosen card above his tableau. knowledge of the game’s state is distributed not only amongst the players but also amongst the material components of the game, and moves between and amongst them throughout the game. this appropriation of the pieces for offloading cognitive tasks has important ramifications for designers of boardgames as well as of the growing number of digital implementations of boardgames and boardgame-like games. currently, digital games typically show a player’s money and resources as numbers, rather than as objects that can be manipulated. making this manipulation visible, as sally does in v4, ensures that the transaction is evident to her opponents and helps players to understand the implications of certain actions [63]; but automatic implementation in a computer game prevents deliberate and accidental cheating. given that players seek to offload cognitive tasks and plans onto the game components, designers of digital games should develop flexible interfaces [12] that allow players to group and reorient representations of the game components within the digital interface, “reorganiz[ing] the distributed cognitive system” [24] as they do in a material boardgame. this preferences the player’s own use of the components to implement the game over the designer’s view of how the components should be implemented and recognises the rich trajectories along which information moves between and amongst players and components. in digital games, as in their material counterparts, the player should be allowed to make sense of their components by grouping, sorting and ordering them to support their own cognitive processes, mirroring the way this activity is observed to occur in material play (v6). digital representations often remove the possibility for cognitive off-loading of information through these core epistemic tasks by neglecting the affordances of the material resource tokens. through careful attention to the play environment, we have shown how both players and observers make use of the various use-histories and other sources of information available to them through the game environment: their own and others’ played pieces, discarded pieces, cards in hand and other tokens, as well as the game rules themselves. players plan their actions not only during their own turn but during other players’ actions as well, when they maintain active engagement with the game (v1), and even before the game starts (v6). lastly, we have demonstrated that in playing a game, players collaborate in a variety of ways, not only in adhering to the prescribed and negotiated rules but also in making sense of them within the play environment: enacting and interpreting them, supporting one another in this process and even in playing with the theme of the game (v6). when errors occur, they are resolved and corrected by the players; with no outside agency beyond the (collaboratively interpreted) rules to dictate the consequences, these rules exceptions must be negotiated [6]. further, players must cooperate to maintain an operational focus on the game rather than on the social activities that accompany it; collaboration is a necessary, ongoing, and inherent part of the work of playing the game. throughout the game, whether the rules are cooperative or oppositional, competition and cooperation go hand in hand. as flavia commented after the game of concordia (v6), “we're not helping each other to win. we're helping each other to play, to make someone win.”",191
A Matter of Control or Safety?: Examining Parental Use of Technical Monitoring Apps on Teens' Mobile Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656563,"adoption rates of parental control applications (""apps"") for teens' mobile devices are low, but little is known about the characteristics of parents (or teens) who use these apps. we conducted a web-based survey of 215 parents and their teens (ages 13-17) using two separate logistic regression models (parent and teen) to examine the factors that predicted parental use of technical monitoring apps on their teens' mobile devices. both parent and teen models confirmed that low autonomy granting (e.g., authoritarian) parents were the most likely to use parental control apps. the teen model revealed additional nuance, indicating that teens who were victimized online and had peer problems were more likely to be monitored by their parents. overall, increased parental control was associated with more (not fewer) online risks. we discuss the implications of these findings and provide design recommendations for mobile apps that promote online safety through engaged, instead of restrictive, parenting. this study is the first to investigate factors that contribute to the use of parental control apps. we found that these “control” apps are, indeed, appropriately named, as low autonomy granting or controlling parenting was one of the key factors that predicted adoption, but was also associated with higher levels of peer problems and online victimizations. thus, we conclude that parental control does not equate to teen safety, and that autonomy-supportive, involved, yet strict parenting, whether through technology or not, is likely the best approach for online parenting.",192
CommunityCrit: Inviting the Public to Improve and Evaluate Urban Design Ideas through Micro-Activities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656564,"while urban design affects the public, most people do not have the time or expertise to participate in the process. many online tools solicit public input, yet typically limit interaction to collecting complaints or early-stage ideas. this paper explores how to engage the public in more complex stages of urban design without requiring a significant time commitment. after observing workshops, we designed a system called communitycrit that offers micro-activities to engage communities in elaborating and evaluating urban design ideas. through a four-week deployment, in partnership with a local planning group seeking to redesign a street intersection, communitycrit yielded 352 contributions (around 10 minutes per participant). the planning group reported that communitycrit provided insights on public perspectives and raised awareness for their project, but noted the importance of setting expectations for the process. people appreciated that the system provided a window into the planning process, empowered them to contribute, and supported diverse levels of skills and availability. this paper introduces a novel system for engaging the public in early-stage urban design processes. in collaboration with a planning group, we observed public workshops and developed a system to engage the public in ideation, elaboration, and evaluation. a key design consideration was how to yield valid contributions given that most people have limited time and bandwidth. we designed a flexible workflow that allows the public to choose the ideas and activities that interest them and offers five activities per session. through a four-week deployment, communitycrit gathered 352 contributions from 39 people and produced new ideas that were comparable to those generated during the face-to-face workshops. communitycrit was successful in engaging people to elaborate on and evaluate ideas, rather than merely voicing issues or submitting ideas. however, our work explored a single urban design project within a fairly early stage in the process. our outreach was limited to few weeks. we studied an urban design use case for one particular intersection. more work is required to understand how our approach can be adapted to other contexts and broader scales. we have identified several key areas for future work. our research team played an active role in recruiting participants for the communitycrit deployment. in order to scale up participation the future, we will need better recruitment strategies and incentive mechanisms. as the contributions increase, further research will be needed to meaningfully organize results. the interface could be designed to support different ways to view contributions (e.g. newest, most/least popular, most/least comments, etc.) and visualize large numbers of ideas with list views or network graphs. both organizers and community members will need tools to make sense of the collected input, including how to represent different stakeholder groups and how to extend the approach into more convergent stages of the urban design process, such as enabling deliberation and consensus building (e.g. [5, 28, 84]). for instance, recent research points to the benefits of identifying and visualizing points of disagreement to help with consensus building process [64], and to providing a clear causal link between public input and its impact on decisions and outcomes [80]. finally, future work can focus on creating an authoring interface to allow planners to adapt the tool for other contexts. we also plan to explore the benefits of using adaptive algorithms to personalize activities based on people’s interests, skills, and other contextual details, such as where they live and their relationship with the project.",193
The Perils of Confounding Factors: How Fitts' Law Experiments can Lead to False Conclusions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656575,"the design of fitts' historical reciprocal tapping experiment gravely confounds index of difficulty id with target distance d: summary statistics for the candidate fitts model and a competing model may appear identical, and the validity of fitts' model for some tasks can be legitimately questioned. we show that the contamination of id by either target distance d or width w is due to the common practices of pooling and averaging data belonging to different distance-width (d,w) pairs for the same id, and taking a geometric progression for values of d and w. we analyze a case study of the validation of fitts' law in eye-gaze movements, where an unfortunate experimental design has misled researchers into believing that eye-gaze movements are not ballistic. we then provide simple guidelines to prevent confounds: practitioners should carefully design the experimental conditions of (d,w), fully distinguish data acquired for different conditions, and put less emphasis on r² scores. we also recommend investigating the use of stochastic sampling for d and w. in the experimental testing of any mathematical model, we may distinguish two steps: 1. sampling the factor space, e.g. fitts’ traditional (d,w) space or guiard’s form×scale space, thus defining a set of experimental conditions for data collection; 2. processing the data by applying operations that yield a score. in fitts’ law studies, this traditionally involves computing means of movement times and r 2 values between id and mt. 6 incidentally, this is precisely how fitts summarized his data in his historical study [10, fig. 4] chi 2018 paper chi 2018, april 21–26, 2018, montréal, qc, canada paper 196 page 8 we have shown that a fitts-like sampling of the (d,w) space solely associated with the computation of r 2 between id and mt creates strong confounds between d and id. we attributed this to the geometric progression of d and w. a simple workaround would seem to be to avoid such a sampling. however, using a constructive approach, we devised a sampling strategy that strongly confounds id with any simple function of d and w. avoiding fitts-like designs is thus insufficient to avoid strong confounds. based on these new results, we analyzed an apparent contradiction between the results of two eye-gaze pointing experiments using. we resolved the contradiction by noting that carpenter’s formula is a widely accepted model for eye-gaze data and by showing that in one of the experiments, fitts’ model was indistinguishable from carpenter’s model due to the use of a fitts-like design. finally, we provide guidelines to avoid strong confounds between factors. we believe that fitts’ law studies place too much emphasis on high r 2 values. it is crucial to introduce other considerations when validating a model, such as the flexibility of the evaluated model, the variability of the dataset and the possibility of competing models. working with block averages or, worse, averages computed for equal values of id, such as mt, dramatically decreases the number of points to be fitted, thereby mechanically increasing r 2 values. an interesting and simple way to prevent strong confounds is to use stochastic sampling of the (d,w) space. stochastic sampling is a promising perspective, especially when considering the replication of studies, as a different but equivalent design can be ensured with each replication. however, more conceptual work is needed to support the idea of using random conditions in a controlled experiment.",194
Utilizing Narrative Grounding to Design Storytelling Gamesfor Creative Foreign Language Production,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656576,"foreign language students must learn to use language creatively to overcome knowledge gaps and keep readers or listeners interested. however, few tools exist to support practicing this skill. therefore, we set out to explore design of storytelling games for practicing creative language use. through an iterative design process, we identified narrative grounding (establishing common ground for collaborative narrative) as key to student engagement and learning. however, designing games for narrative grounding while keeping the game flexible enough to easily accommodate teacher goals is challenging. considering this challenge, we designed a collaborative storytelling game where students help scaffold the narrative and teachers can easily integrate language goals with ""language cards"". in an in-classroom evaluation with 36 students, we show the importance of narrative grounding for learning. qualitative evidence also suggests narrative grounding makes the game more engaging for players. we conclude with discussion of design implications for digital language learning tools. we presented the design process and findings from a storytelling game to help classroom teachers to encourage practicing creative foreign language production. through our iterative design process, we explored challenges in designing storytelling games for the classroom, which we hope can inspire other design work in this area. we found that designing for narrative grounding can help us address many of the core challenges in storytelling games, and we used this to guide our final design and study. quantitative results from our study as well as players’ feedback indicated that with more narrative grounding, students feel more engaged and can better improve creative language production. finally, we offer recommendations to help designers encourage active listening with team play, utilize story elements to help scaffold learning and inspire creativity, and balance teacher-generated constraints with student-generated constraints to keep the game adaptable for ever-changing pedagogical goals. we hope that these recommendations can improve the design of future language learning systems.",195
Accessible Maps for the Blind: Comparing 3D Printed Models with Tactile Graphics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656577,"tactile maps are widely used in orientation and mobility (o&m) training for people with blindness and severe vision impairment. commodity 3d printers now offer an alternative way to present accessible graphics, however it is unclear if 3d models offer advantages over tactile equivalents for 2d graphics such as maps. in a controlled study with 16 touch readers, we found that 3d models were preferred, enabled the use of more easily understood icons, facilitated better short term recall and allowed relative height of map elements to be more easily understood. analysis of hand movements revealed the use of novel strategies for systematic scanning of the 3d model and gaining an overview of the map. finally, we explored how 3d printed maps can be augmented with interactive audio labels, replacing less practical braille labels. our findings suggest that 3d printed maps do indeed offer advantages for o&m training. we investigated whether 3d printed maps offer benefits over the current use of tactile maps in o&m training. while it is clear that 3d models offer benefits when representing inherently three-dimensional objects, it was not clear whether they also offered benefits for maps. in a controlled user-study with 16 severely vision impaired adults we found a strong user preference for 3d plans. while it is possible that that selection and response bias influenced this preference for the new technology, a mitigating bias towards the more familiar tactile representation was also expected. performance measures revealed that the 3d maps were easier to understand than tactile equivalents due to the use of 3d iconic symbols and allowed relative height of map elements to be more easily understood. there was also some advantage in short term recall but not for longer term recall. we conjecture that the fundamental reason why 3d prints were generally preferred to tactile graphics is a perceptual mismatch between touch and the vision-based conventions used in tactile graphics such as aerial or side views and depth cues like occlusion to show relative height. the use of 3d prints reduces the need for these conventions and so we infer reduces the cognitive load required to understand the graphic. while our studies provide partial support for this we plan to explore this interesting question further. we have also investigated techniques for augmenting 3d printed maps with interactive audio-labels. interactive audiolabels provide several benefits over braille labels, including a clearer tactile experience and enabling people who cannot read braille to understand the graphic. they also allow information to be provided at different levels of detail and for labels to be updated without the need for reprinting. we explored how low-cost “maker community” electronics can be used to provide robust interactive audio labels on 3d printed maps. such maps could be provided in public spaces such as train stations or shopping centres to improve accessibility. our studies have significant implications for o&m training, suggesting that 3d prints augment or replace the current use of tactile maps. based on our studies we have developed some initial guidelines for the design of accessible 3d prints and for teaching touch readers to read them. one limitation of our main study was that participants were touch readers with experience reading tactile graphics. a replication of the study with participants with recent vision loss is needed to determine whether similar benefits are found.",196
Reactile: Programming Swarm User Interfaces through Direct Physical Manipulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N656578,"we explore a new approach to programming swarm user interfaces (swarm ui) by leveraging direct physical manipulation. existing swarm ui applications are written using a robot programming framework: users work on a computer screen and think in terms of low-level controls. in contrast, our approach allows programmers to work in physical space by directly manipulating objects and think in terms of high-level interface design. inspired by current ui programming practices, we introduce a four-step workflow-create elements, abstract attributes, specify behaviors, and propagate changes-for swarm ui programming. we propose a set of direct physical manipulation techniques to support each step in this workflow. to demonstrate these concepts, we developed reactile, a swarm ui programming environment that actuates a swarm of small magnets and displays spatial information of program states using a dlp projector. two user studies-an in-class survey with 148 students and a lab interview with eight participants-confirm that our approach is intuitive and understandable for programming swarm uis. although the proposed interactions were generally appreciated, the technical limitations of our hardware prototype sometimes limited the usability and capability of our approach. for example, the refresh rate in the current implementation depends on the number of objects and it becomes non-negligible as the number of markers increases. while this can be addressed through different implementations (e.g., using a transistor for each coil instead of multiplexing), this prevented users from receiving immediate feedback, making it difficult to predict a program’s behavior (p1, p7). another hardware limitation is the information resolution. although an individual marker is small in size, the minimum distance between two markers (30 mm) prevents them from forming a high-density shape. we also tested smaller and weaker magnets with n35 and 8 mm diameter, which requires only 12-15 mm distance. however, there is a trade-off with the weight of the marker. for example, in the above case, if we attach a 3d printed cap (1.1 g), it can become difficult to travel. however, we expect the minimum distance can be decreased using a galvanized steel case [23]. while these limitations are not about our proposed interaction techniques, having appropriate hardware can be crucial for better programming experiences. the hardware design option explored by this work is based on a swarm of simple, passive magnets actuated by a board. another option for future work is to explore other types of robots such as wheel-based robots. one concern is that these robots may introduce cost increases and additional technical challenges in coordinating them as a swarm. however, we are seeing a growing body of research projects [22] and commercial efforts to address this concern [28], which can eventually lead to significant cost reduction and make swarm uis practical in the near future. this work contributes to that possible future by proposing a programming paradigm people can use to create a range of novel swarm ui applications. in terms of the capability of our programming paradigm, an interesting discussion is how to extend our approach to additional dimensions. for example, p3 mentioned that additional attributes such as color, texture, and z height can be helpful for creating more expressive applications such as data visualizations, accessibility, and shape-displays. however, it is not trivial to extend our approach to these modalities. for future work, we will explore how our approach can be generalized to these other application domains.",197
Increasing User Attention with a Comic-based Policy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657902,"end user license agreements, terms of service agreements and privacy policies all suffer from many of the same problems: people rarely read them and yet still agree to whatever is contained within them. there are many usability challenges with these policies: they are often lengthy, with jargon filled language that is difficult to quickly comprehend. however, these notices are the primary tool for users to understand the privacy implications of their digital activities and make informed decisions on which websites and software they use. prior research has explored alternative designs for such notices, using more visual and structured interfaces for conveying information. we expand upon these results by exploring a comic-based interface, examining whether it can engage users to pay more attention to a terms of service agreement. our results indicate that the comic version did hold user attention for longer than text-based alternatives, encouraging deeper investigation into comic-based interfaces. our results so far imply that taking the approach of displaying important information to a user using a more graphical design rather than lengthy jargon can improve attention and the average time spent reading tos agreements. this initial comic design was very basic, with lots of text. while not unrealistic, it does not take full advantage of the affordances of comics to engage and communicate to users. we believe simpler and more graphical comics with reduced text will further benefit users. however, organizations would need guidelines and assistance for creating such summaries. they may also need incentives to do so. future research will need to investigate what motivates the service providers to provide more usable policies to their users, and guidelines that are useful and actionable for them to create such interfaces. finally, our ultimate goal is to help users make more informed decisions. as yet, we have found no evidence that user understanding is improved with the comic and we did not examine actual decision making in our study. we hope this study provides additional evidence that novel privacy notice designs warrant additional investigation, and encourage future studies to examine how to support privacy decision making.",198

vrSocial: Toward Immersive Therapeutic VR Systems for Children with Autism,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657916,"social communication frequently includes nuanced nonverbal communication cues, including eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice. this type of communication is central to face-to-face interaction, but can be challenging for children and adults with autism. innovative technologies can provide support by augmenting human-delivered cuing and automated prompting. specifically, immersive virtual reality (vr) offers an option to generalize social skill interventions by concretizing nonverbal information in real-time social interactions. in this work, we explore the design and evaluation of three nonverbal communication applications in immersive vr. the results of this work indicate that delivering real-time visualizations of proximity, speaker volume, and duration of one's speech is feasible in immersive vr and effective for real-time support for proximity regulation for children with autism. we conclude with design considerations for therapeutic vr systems. immersive vr has tremendous potential as an accessible space for face-to-face social interaction for those with nonverbal communication challenges. beyond reducing sensory input and designing visualization applications in vr, making accessible social spaces includes leveraging the potential to access mainstream infrastructure to support a broader base of users [23]. additionally, we need to acknowledge and support the creation of safe spaces that can be shared beyond a therapy session [31]. technologicallymediated interactions entail going beyond limited-access assistive technology systems to specifically designing for neuro-shared space that promote “compassionate interaction” [34]. if children with autism are at higher risk for social isolation and choose to use screens to escape an overwhelming world, is it not time for them to join in a shared safe place? might this be a call to the next generation of immersive vr applications to reach beyond demonstrating efficacy as a therapeutic tool to strive for greater accessibility to the social world. future work could focus on end-user toolkits to customize an immersive experience.",202
DeepWriting: Making Digital Ink Editable via Deep Generative Modeling,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657917,"digital ink promises to combine the flexibility and aesthetics of handwriting and the ability to process, search and edit digital text. character recognition converts handwritten text into a digital representation, albeit at the cost of losing personalized appearance due to the technical difficulties of separating the interwoven components of content and style. in this paper, we propose a novel generative neural network architecture that is capable of disentangling style from content and thus making digital ink editable. our model can synthesize arbitrary text, while giving users control over the visual appearance (style). for example, allowing for style transfer without changing the content, editing of digital ink at the word level and other application scenarios such as spell-checking and correction of handwritten text. we furthermore contribute a new dataset of handwritten text with fine-grained annotations at the character level and report results from an initial user evaluation. we have proposed a novel approach for making digital ink editable, which we call conditional variational recurrent neural networks (c-vrnn ). at the core of our method lies a deep nn architecture that disentangles content from style. the key idea underlying our approach is to treat style and content as two separate latent random variables with distributions learned during training. at sampling time one can then draw from the content and style component to edit either style, content or both, or one can generate entirely new samples. these learned statistical distributions make traditional approaches to nn training intractable, due to the lack of access to the true distributions. moreover, to produce realistic samples of digital ink the model needs to perform auxiliary tasks, such as controlling the spacing in between words, character segmentation and recognition. furthermore, we have build a variety of proof-of-concept applications, including conditional synthesis and editing of digital ink at the word level. initial user feedback, while preliminary, indicates that users are largely positive about the capability to edit digital ink - in one’s own handwriting or in the style of another author. to enable the community to build on our work we release our implementation as open-source. finally, we have contributed a compound dataset, consolidating existing and newly collected handwritten text into a single corpus, annotated to the character level. data and code are publicly available 1 . while our model can create both disconnected and connected (cursive) styles, its performance is currently better for the former, simpler case. this also applies to most state-of-theart character recognition techniques, and we leave extending our method to fully support cursive script for future work. further, we are planning to integrate our currently auxiliary character recognition network into the proposed architecture. one interesting direction in this respect would be the inclusion of a full language model. finally, and in part inspired by initial feedback, we believe that the underlying technology bears a lot of potential for research in other application domains dealing with time-series, such as motion data (e.g., animation, graphics) or sketches and drawings (e.g., arts and education).",203
Media of Things: Supporting the Production of Metadata Rich Media Through IoT Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657918,"rich metadata is becoming a key part of the broadcast production pipeline. this information can be used to deliver compelling new consumption experiences which are personalized, location-aware, interactive and multi-screen. however, media producers are struggling to generate the metadata required for such experiences, using inefficient post-production solutions which are limited in how much of the original context they can capture. in response, we present media of things (mot), a tool for on-location media productions. mot enables practical and flexible generation of sensor based point-of-capture metadata. we demonstrate how embedded ubiquitous sensing technologies such as the internet of things can be leveraged to produce context rich, time sequenced metadata in a production studio. we reflect on how this workflow can be integrated within the constraints of broadcast production and the possibilities that emerge from access to rich data at the beginning of the production lifecycle to produce well described media for reconfigurable consumption. in this paper, we present media of things, our implementation of a point-of-capture metadata capture system which integrates into the existing production workflow. by supporting the capture of raw, time-based sensor data from multiple sources in real-time, mot provides a solid base for creating rich object-based media based experiences in the future. we highlight the symmetry in using iot based technologies with ‘invisible’ sensors which can record actions and object use on a film set which responds to the need to capture such contextual and descriptive information from broadcasts in nearly-live scenarios and post production. through the deployment of media of things in a real production scenario, we explore how metadata capture can become part of the film production workflow. our primary contribution is the validation of sensor-based metadata capture as a sustainable and flexible process that can be included reasonably within the existing constraints of the media production pipeline. specifically, we recommend that the ‘sensor role’ should be recognized as a distinct and valued member of the production team, in line with the roles allocated to ‘sound’ and ‘lighting’ professionals, facilitating a smooth transition into the professional workflow. when planning for mot style productions however we caution that the selection of sensors is a nuanced and often difficult tradeoff between granularity of data and operational requirements for configuration. this is an area that we acknowledge would benefit from more work, trialing different sensors for the collection of data. although our deployment was within the situated and constrained environment of a cookery show, the structured and standardized nature of film production means that mot has been used against the inherent situational factors which define such workflows. combined with the flexibility offered by our sensor agnostic approach, we envision that mot could be used as part of the normal production workflow for any production scenario, when appropriate sensing is applied. in summary, we encourage the community to consider how production tools such as mot which leverage existing trends in iot can be integrated into existing production pipelines now, to more quickly enable the rich, immersive and indeed exciting experiences that object-based media can deliver.",204
Enhancing Online Problems Through Instructor-Centered Tools for Randomized Experiments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657919,"digital educational resources could enable the use of randomized experiments to answer pedagogical questions that instructors care about, taking academic research out of the laboratory and into the classroom. we take an instructor-centered approach to designing tools for experimentation that lower the barriers for instructors to conduct experiments. we explore this approach through dynamicproblem, a proof-of-concept system for experimentation on components of digital problems, which provides interfaces for authoring of experiments on explanations, hints, feedback messages, and learning tips. to rapidly turn data from experiments into practical improvements, the system uses an interpretable machine learning algorithm to analyze students' ratings of which conditions are helpful, and present conditions to future students in proportion to the evidence they are higher rated. we evaluated the system by collaboratively deploying experiments in the courses of three mathematics instructors. they reported benefits in reflecting on their pedagogy, and having a new method for improving online problems for future students. to help realize the promise of experimentation to help instructors enhance digital educational resources, this paper presented design guidelines for more instructor-centered tools for experimentation. our goal was to reduce the programming knowledge and time that instructors need to conduct experiments, and to help instructors more rapidly use data to enhance the learning experience of the next student. we instantiated a solution in the proof-of-concept system dynamicproblem, which lowered the barriers for instructors to conduct experiments on elaboration messages in online problems, such as explanations, hints, and learning tips. the system used a multiarmed bandit algorithm to analyze and use data about students’ ratings, in order to present the higher rated conditions to future students, automatically enhancing the problems. case study deployments with three instructors suggested the system helped them reflect on how to improve pedagogy, and provided a data-driven pathway for enhancing their online problems. just as decades of work have established how learning researchers can effectively use experiments, a great deal of future work is needed to understand how instructors can effectively use experiments. a hosted version of the dynamicproblem system can be used in courses by following the instructions at www.josephjaywilliams.com/dynamicproblem, and the code base is available on github by following the url http://tiny.cc/githubdynamicproblem. we hope that this paper provides a foundation for future investigations of instructorcentered experimentation.",205
Exploring the Role of Conversational Cues in Guided Task Support with Virtual Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657910,"voice-based conversational assistants are growing in popularity on ubiquitous mobile and stationary devices. cortana, as well as google home, amazon echo, and others, can provide support for various tasks from managing reminders to booking a hotel. however, with few exceptions, user input is limited to explicit queries or commands. in this work, we explore the role of implicit conversational cues in guided task completion scenarios. in a wizard of oz study, we found that, for the task of cooking a recipe, nearly one-quarter of all user-assistant exchanges were initiated from implicit conversational cues rather than from plain questions. given that these implicit cues occur in such high frequency, we conclude by presenting a set of design implications for the design of guided task experiences in contemporary conversational assistants. current voice-based conversational assistants mostly abide by the <trigger word, question, answer> paradigm, which constrains user interactions, and a number of implicit conversational cues are missed as a result. in this work we have considered a set of common implicit verbal cues exhibited by users of a simulated conversational assistant for the task of cooking a culinary recipe. we have described these cues and their intents in detail and have provided a set of design implications for designing task-oriented conversational systems.",206
Simulator Sickness in Augmented Reality Training Using the Microsoft HoloLens,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657911,"augmented reality is on the rise with consumer-grade smart glasses becoming available in recent years. those interested in deploying these head-mounted displays need to understand better the effect technology has on the end user. one key aspect potentially hindering the use is motion sickness, a known problem inherited from virtual reality, which so far remains under-explored. in this paper we address this problem by conducting an experiment with 142 subjects in three different industries: aviation, medical, and space. we evaluate whether the microsoft hololens, an augmented reality head-mounted display, causes simulator sickness and how different symptom groups contribute to it (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation). our findings suggest that the microsoft hololens causes across all participants only negligible symptoms of simulator sickness. most consumers who use it will face no symptoms while only few experience minimal discomfort in the training environments we tested it in. in this work, we empirically investigated simulator sickness in augmented reality training applications using microsoft hololens. we found insignificant effects of simulator sickness. the main factor contributing to it is eyestrain, a symptom in the oculomotor group. we concluded that mixed reality interaction (spanning both the real and physical world) is less likely to cause simulator sickness than interaction with virtual elements alone. simulator sickness should be understood as a complex phenomenon, which differs from our everyday conception of motion sickness, often simply perceived as nausea. based on our results, eyestrain can be seen as the most common and prominent symptom caused by using the hololens. the symptoms observed appeared less frequent and milder than in comparable virtual reality simulators. nonetheless, they cause discomfort to and affect technology acceptance of those selected few suffering of them. innovation on how to alleviate these symptoms would certainly be beneficial to facilitate increase uptake.",207
Experiencing the Body as Play,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657912,"games research in hci is continually interested in the human body. however, recent work suggests that the field has only begun to understand how to design bodily games. we propose that the games research field is advancing from playing with digital content using a keyboard, to using bodies to play with digital content, towards a future where we experience our bodies as digital play. to guide designers interested in supporting players to experience their bodies as play, we present two phenomenological perspectives on the human body (körper and leib) and articulate a suite of design tactics using our own and other people's work. we hope with this paper, we are able to help designers embrace the point that we both ""have"" a body and ""are"" a body, thereby aiding the facilitation of the many benefits of engaging the human body through games and play, and ultimately contributing to a more humanized technological future. interaction design and, in particular, game design has an ongoing interest in the intersection between interactive technology and the human body, fuelled by technological advancements. yet, recent scholarly work suggests that the field has only just begun to fully understand the various perspectives through which designers can see the human body. to advance the field, we introduced two perspectives on the human body (körper and leib) and articulated implications for design. we discussed these perspectives by looking at a set of bodily game and play systems from our own and other’s work. we see our work not as a complete investigation into the körper and leib in game design, but rather as a springboard for future investigations. in summary, our work aims to contribute to the emerging intersection between the human body and interactive games and play. we believe that for a successful combination of technology and the human body, we need to move beyond seeing the human body as solely a “thing”, instead we need to embrace that we both have a body and are a body. if we do so, we believe it is possible to experience our body as play. we hope with our work we are aiding in facilitating the many benefits of engaging the human body through games and play, ultimately contributing to a more humanized technological future.",208
Upstanding by Design: Bystander Intervention in Cyberbullying,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657913,"although bystander intervention can mitigate the negative effects of cyberbullying, few bystanders ever attempt to intervene. in this study, we explored the effects of interface design on bystander intervention using a simulated custom-made social media platform. participants took part in a three-day, in-situ experiment, in which they were exposed to several cyberbullying incidents. depending on the experimental condition, they received different information about the audience size and viewing notifications intended to increase a sense of personal responsibility in bystanders. results indicated that bystanders were more likely to intervene indirectly than directly, and information about the audience size and viewership increased the likelihood of flagging cyberbullying posts through serial mediation of public surveillance, accountability, and personal responsibility. the study has implications for understanding bystander effect in cyberbullying, and how to develop design solutions to encourage bystander intervention in social media. this research presents a new approach to increasing bystander intervention when cyberbullying occurs. we used research on the bystander effect and bim to inform design interventions on a custom-made social media platform to increase upstanding behavior. to do this, we altered the site’s user interface by adding markers of public surveillance to increase bystanders’ personal responsibility and likelihood of intervention. although most bystanders did not intervene throughout the three-day study, we found that participants who received information on audience size and view notifications were more likely to intervene because they internalized personal responsibility prompted by increases in accountability and public surveillance. this suggests that upstanding by design could be a viable solution that can help bystanders to become upstanders by encouraging their sense of personal responsibility for a cyberbullying situation.",209
Examining the Demand for Spam: Who Clicks?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657914,"despite significant advances in automated spam detection, some spam content manages to evade detection and engage users. while the spam supply chain is well understood through previous research, there is little understanding of spam consumers. we focus on the demand side of the spam equation examining what drives users to click on spam via a large-scale analysis of de-identified, aggregated facebook log data (n=600,000). we find (1) that the volume of spam and clicking norms in a users' network are significantly related to individual consumption behavior; (2) that more active users are less likely to click, suggesting that experience and internet skill (weakly correlated with activity level) may create more savvy consumers; and (3) we confirm previous findings about the gender effect in spam consumption, but find this effect largely corresponds to spam topics. our findings provide practical insights to reduce demand for spam content, thereby affecting spam profitability. in this work we contribute one of the largest scale studies of spam clicking behavior to date, and the first study to examine spam consumption behavior on social media. we find that more active users are less likely to consume spam, and find a weak positive correlation between activity level and internet and facebook skills – suggesting that higher skill may, in part, help users avoid spam. we also find that the volume of spam in a users’ social network as well as clicking norms in that network influence their behavior. we identify a new, nuanced relationship between resharing, content-viewer relationships and click behavior. we find that resharing increases clicking on spam from friends, but decreases clicking on spam posted by friends-of-friends or pages, suggesting that resharing serves as different heuristic roles depending on the type of content. chi 2018 paper chi 2018, april 21–26, 2018, montréal, qc, canada paper 212 page 7 additionally, we echo prior results finding that women are more likely to click on spam [26, 49], but find based on the results of open-coding of 250 pieces of spam content, that this relationship between gender and clicking is likely due to differences in the type of spam seen on facebook, rather than anything intrinsically gender-related. our results suggest that spam topics are likely a significant feature driving click behavior. in summary, we provide some of the first insights on users’ consumption of spam on social media and find that spam clicking behavior on facebook is affected by factors unique from those that affect clicking on general content. based on these results, we suggest new directions for the design and targeting of spam interventions to disrupt the spam value chain and keep users secure.",210
ColorMod: Recoloring 3D Printed Objects using Photochromic Inks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657925,"recent research has shown how to change the color of existing objects using photochromic materials. these materials can switch their appearance from transparent to colored when exposed to light of a certain wavelength. the color remains even when the object is removed from the light source. the process is fully reversible allowing users to recolor the object as many times as they want. so far, these systems have been limited to single color changes, i.e. changes from transparent to colored. in this paper, we present colormod, a method to extend this approach to multi-color changes (e.g., red-to-yellow). we accomplish this using a multi-color pattern with one color per voxel across the surface of the object. when recoloring the object, our system locally activates only those voxels that have the desired color and turns all other voxels off. we describe colormod's hardware/software system and its user interface that comes with a conversion tool for 3d printing as well as a painting tool that matches physical voxels with the desired appearance. we also contribute our own material formula for a 3d-printable photochromic ink. we presented colormod, a method for changing the color of a 3d-printed object even after fabrication. we demonstrated how by printing different photochromic colors in a dense multi-color voxel pattern across an object’s surface, we can recolor the object by selectively turning specific color voxels on and off. we explained the different factors influencing how precisely and how fast we can activate individual voxels and also provided a description of the material formula for our custom 3d printable photochromic ink. for future work, we plan to make the setup more compact to allow for mobile use. our long-term goal is to allow users to recolor objects while on the go using a smart phone with an integrated micro-projector and uv light.",211

Evaluation Beyond Usability: Validating Sustainable HCI Research,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657928,"the evaluation of research artefacts is an important step to validate research contributions. sub-disciplines of hci often pursue primary goals other than usability, such as sustainable hci (shci), hci for development, or health and wellbeing. for such disciplines, established evaluation methods are not always appropriate or sufficient, and new conventions for identifying, discussing, and justifying suitable evaluation methods need to be established. in this paper, we revisit the purpose and goals of evaluation in hci and shci, and elicit five key elements that can provide guidance to identifying evaluation methods for shci research. our essay is meant as a starting point for discussing current and improving future evaluation practice in shci; we also believe it holds value for other subdisciplines in hci that encounter similar challenges while evaluating their research. in this paper, we sought to explore ways to address the evaluation problem when the primary goal is not usability. we have looked at the history of evaluation in hci and shci and discussed ways to assess the validity of sustainability in research projects. as a starting point for and to facilitate the debate within the community we highlighted five ingredients that, based on past research on evaluation in hci and other fields, are critical for identifying an appropriate evaluation method. we emphasize that our recipe is not meant as a framework for evaluation itself, but as a process to guide researchers towards identifying the most suitable evaluation for their research; and to give researchers a common set of terms for justifying and debating evaluation. in our understanding, this work is only a first step towards solving the evaluation problem, and while we believe that it is a helpful step not only for shci but also for other areas in hci, more work is required. we hope that the community builds on this work and that it spurs the debate about identifying new ways to evaluate research artefacts beyond usability.",214

Projective Windows: Bringing Windows in Space to the Fingertip,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657920,"in augmented and virtual reality (ar and vr), there may be many 3d planar windows with 2d texts, images, and videos on them. however, managing the position, orientation, and scale of such a window in an immersive 3d workspace can be difficult. projective windows strategically uses the absolute and apparent sizes of the window at various stages of the interaction to enable the grabbing, moving, scaling, and releasing of the window in one continuous hand gesture. with it, the user can quickly and intuitively manage and interact with windows in space without any controller hardware or dedicated widget. through an evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique is performant and preferable, and that projective geometry plays an important role in the design of spatial user interfaces. we proposed projective windows, a technique for arranging 3d planar windows in ar and vr workspaces, which is, thanks to its strategic use of the absolute and apparent sizes of a window at various stages of the interaction, minimal, direct, and intuitive, requiring only a single continuous flow of hand gesture and no other controllers and ui widgets. we evaluated our technique quantitatively and qualitatively, and found that it performed significantly better against a baseline technique for two key metrics: task completion time (22%) and operations count (40%). we furthermore demonstrated the relevance and usefulness of exploiting projective geometry in designing spatial uis. some speculate that ar and vr devices might come to replace all screen-based devices in the future [17]. for projective windows to facilitate seamless interactions with 2d content in future immersive 3d experiences, more work is needed on the systematic use of ad-hoc surfaces, such as the palm or a handheld plane prop, and surrounding geometries, such as wall edges or ceilings. in addition, it should better integrate with other relevant 3d windows techniques [5, 9, 10, 14].",216
Scenariot: Spatially Mapping Smart Things Within Augmented Reality Scenes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657921,"the emerging simultaneous localizing and mapping (slam) based tracking technique allows the mobile ar device spatial awareness of the physical world. still, smart things are not fully supported with the spatial awareness in ar. therefore, we present scenariot, a method that enables instant discovery and localization of the surrounding smart things while also spatially registering them with a slam based mobile ar system. by exploiting the spatial relationships between mobile ar systems and smart things, scenariot fosters in-situ interactions with connected devices. we embed ultra-wide band (uwb) rf units into the ar device and the controllers of the smart things, which allows for measuring the distances between them. with a one-time initial calibration, users localize multiple iot devices and map them within the ar scenes. through a series of experiments and evaluations, we validate the localization accuracy as well as the performance of the enabled spatial aware interactions. further, we demonstrate various use cases through scenariot. our paper builds towards the broad goal of empowering users with the ability to quickly discover and intuitively interact with the connected smart things within the surrounding environment. we propose scenariot to discover and localize the surrounding smart things as well as spatially register them with a slam based mobile ar device. by leveraging the spatial registration, in-situ ar interaction with the iot devices is enabled. through our experiments and user studies, we verified our method is capable of providing object level localization accuracy ∼ 0.4m with multiple devices distributed in a cluttered scene (∼ 10×10m). therefore, we believe this work can bring spatial awareness to the iot devices within an ar scene and further inspire advanced interaction designs.",217

The Role of Gamification in Participatory Environmental Sensing: A Study In the Wild,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657923,"participatory sensing (ps) and citizen science hold promises for a genuinely interactive and inclusive citizen engagement in meaningful and sustained collection of data about social and environmental phenomena. yet the underlying motivations for public engagement in ps remain still unclear particularly regarding the role of gamification, for which hci research findings are often inconclusive. this paper reports the findings of an experimental study specifically designed to further understand the effects of gamification on citizen engagement. our study involved the development and implementation of two versions (gamified and non-gamified) of a mobile application designed to capture lake ice coverage data in the sub-arctic region. emerging findings indicate a statistically significant effect of gamification on participants' engagement levels in ps. the motivation, approach and results of our study are outlined and implications of the findings for future ps design are reflected. in this work, we present the results from an experimental user study that explored the impact of gamification on engagement and user experience. we designed, deployed and evaluated two environmental sensing applications (one gamified and one non-gamified) via a 20 days experiment with volunteers. we found that gamification affected the participants’ engagement in a positive way (producing more submissions), without improving nor compromising their user experience. this led us to think that in order to produce human engagement, altering interfaces is not enough. this supports the review results of nacke et al. [44] that adding simple visual manifestation of gamification elements or deterministic mechanics to the interface is not enough without considering other aspects of engagement. deterding et al. propose [10] that gamified motivation design should move from stimulus-effect determinism to providing fun, engaging and playful experiences. our participants mentioned ""proving data for a good cause"", ""i like going out to nature"" and ""it is useful not only for lakes, but for people as well"" as motivating factors. this leads us to conclude that the gamification design for environmental sensing had a positive effect on participants’ engagement. even when the underlying technology is still evolving, participatory sensing has already shown its great potential, not only as a tool for citizens’ collecting data but also as a vehicle for engaging a large public community in solving social and environmental challenges. these systems have the potential to close the gaps among researchers, environmental experts, decision-makers, and the people, while collecting data and building a whole new level of services (from the people, for the people). however, the success of participatory sensing relies heavily on continuous citizen participation and the computational capacity to extract patterns from the data being collected.",219
How Information Sharing about Care Recipients by Family Caregivers Impacts Family Communication,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657924,"previous research has shown that tracking technologies have the potential to help family caregivers optimize their coping strategies and improve their relationships with care recipients. in this paper, we explore how sharing the tracked data (i.e., caregiving journals and patient's conditions) with other family caregivers affects home care and family communication. although previous works suggested that family caregivers may benefit from reading the records of others, sharing patients' private information might fuel negative feelings of surveillance and violation of trust for care recipients. to address this research question, we added a sharing feature to the previously developed tracking tool and deployed it for six weeks in the homes of 15 family caregivers who were caring for a depressed family member. our findings show how the sharing feature attracted the attention of care recipients and helped the family caregivers discuss sensitive issues with care recipients. this paper showed how information sharing among family caregivers affected homecare and family communication. we developed a tracking tool that allows family caregivers to record their caregiving activities and care recipient’s conditions and share them with other family caregivers. a deployment study of our tool revealed that the sharing feature not only helped the caregivers improve their coping strategies but also positively affected the care recipients. our most significant finding is that the tool provided the caregivers and the care recipients with indirect ways to discuss sensitive home issues. our findings describe how the sharing feature helped them avoid direct communication/conflict while still allowing them to indirectly discuss problems. the sharing feature also provided care recipients indirect ways to learn and gain emotional support from other caregivers, which sometimes motivated them to engage in positive behaviors. we believe these findings will contribute to the field of hci by suggesting new ways for designing health-tracking technologies and information sharing.",220
DataInk: Direct and Creative Data-Oriented Drawing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657935,"creating whimsical, personal data visualizations remains a challenge due to a lack of tools that enable for creative visual expression while providing support to bind graphical content to data. many data analysis and visualization creation tools target the quick generation of visual representations, but lack the functionality necessary for graphics design. toolkits and charting libraries offer more expressive power, but require expert programming skills to achieve custom designs. in contrast, sketching affords fluid experimentation with visual shapes and layouts in a free-form manner, but requires one to manually draw every single data point. we aim to bridge the gap between these extremes. we propose dataink, a system supports the creation of expressive data visualizations with rigorous direct manipulation via direct pen and touch input. leveraging our commonly held skills, coupled with a novel graphical user interface, dataink enables direct, fluid, and flexible authoring of creative data visualizations. we propose dataink, a system for authoring whimsical and personalized visual representations of data. dataink aims at supporting the creative process while affording design expression to craft visually-rich graphics via freeform sketching and rigorous execution by maintaining a tight coupling between visuals and data via direct manipulation. the design decisions of supporting direct manipulation are embodied as a simple set of pen-and-touch interaction techniques and a fluid graphical user interface, which enable both rich expressiveness and effortless execution of data visualizations. a user study with eight designers and non-experts suggests that this approach is promising and demonstrate that dataink allows users to unleash their creativity to experiment with differently visual designs and create a diverse set of glyph-based visualizations.",221
Remediating a Design Tool: Implications of Digitizing Sticky Notes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657936,"sticky notes are ubiquitous in design processes because of their tangibility and ease of use. yet, they have well-known limitations in professional design processes, as documentation and distribution are cumbersome at best. this paper compares the use of sticky notes in ideation with a remediated digital sticky notes setup. the paper contributes with a nuanced understanding of what happens when remediating a physical design tool into digital space, by emphasizing focus shifts and breakdowns caused by the technology, but also benefits and promises inherent in the digital media. despite users' preference for creating physical notes, handling digital notes on boards was easier and the potential of proper documentation make the digital setup a possible alternative. while the analogy in our remediation supported a transfer of learned handling, the users' experiences across technological setups impact their use and understanding, yielding new concerns regarding cross-device transfer and collaboration. this paper presented a qualitative, comparative study of physical sticky note use to a remediated digital sticky notes setup. the results were analyzed using the activity theoretical humanartifact model pointing at expected, and unexpected, differences and similarities between the setups, when it comes to physical adaptation and learned handling. despite users’ general preference for creating physical sticky notes, the digital technologies have reached a point where easier handling of digital sticky notes on interactive screens and the potential of proper design documentation makes it an alternative to their physical counterparts. addressing the digital sticky notes as remediation, we conclude that while the analogy in our remediation supported a transfer of learned handling, the users’ experiences from other technological setups impact their use and understanding, leading to new concerns regarding crossdevice transfer and collaboration, and fewer for tangibility.",222
Slacktivists or Activists?: Identity Work in the Virtual Disability March,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657937,"protests are important social forms of activism, but can be inaccessible to people with disabilities. online activism, like the 2017 disability march, has provided alternative venues for involvement in accessible protesting and social movements. in this study, we use identity theory as a lens to understand why and how disabled activists engaged in an online movement, and its impact on their self-concepts. we interviewed 18 disabled activists about their experiences with online protesting during the disability march. respondents' identities (as both disabled individuals and as activists) led them to organize or join the march, evolved alongside the group's actions, and were reprioritized or strained as a result of their involvement. our findings describe the values and limitations of this activism to our respondents, highlight the tensions they perceived about their activist identities, and present opportunities to support further accessibility and identity changes by integrating technology into their activist experiences. this paper presents how an online social movement unfolded and influenced participants’ identities as disabled activists. people with disabilities must overcome multiple accessibility barriers to be involved with traditional protests and activism. these barriers were described as the main reason for the successful growth of this online movement by our respondents. using identity theory as a theoretical lens, we have highlighted how marchers conducted identity work during the movement and experienced self-change. however, the marchers still questioned the legitimacy of their actions and activist identities. based on our findings, we believe the legitimacy of virtual activism must be reconsidered by able-bodied activists. we propose ways to support participation of disabled people in online activism.",223
Applying Computational Analysis to Textual Data from the Wild: A Feminist Perspective,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657938,"with technologies that afford much larger-scale data collection than previously imagined, new ways of processing and interpreting qualitative textual data are required. hci researchers use a range of methods for interpreting the 'full range of human experience' from qualitative data, however, such approaches are not always scalable. feminist geography seeks to explore how diverse and varied accounts of place can be understood and represented, whilst avoiding reductive classification systems. in this paper, we assess the extent to which unsupervised topic models can support such a research agenda. drawing on literature from feminist and critical gis, we present a case study analysis of a volunteered geographic information dataset of reviews about breastfeeding in public spaces. we demonstrate that topic modelling can offer novel insights and nuanced interpretations of complex concepts such as privacy and be integrated into a critically reflexive feminist data analysis approach that captures and represents diverse experiences of place. in this paper we presented a combination of computational and human approaches for textual analysis, suitable for largescale experiential data. we have demonstrated the underlying methods and challenges behind exploring and analysing a reallife vgi dataset and positioning this experiential, qualitative dataset (feedfinder reviews) in dialogue with a structural, quantitative dataset (imd). we position this work alongside other efforts to develop a feminist hci methodology, as it begins to unpick the challenges and opportunities of dialectic information gathering, exploring how a heterogeneity of data sources and interpretations can be employed [5] and combined with computational approaches. an essential a priori step in achieving this is clearly to do with data collection. in order to empirically examine the ‘knowledges among very different and power-differentiated communities’ [17], we must first establish access to accounts of situated knowledge. as demonstrated by the work of balaam et al. [2] and feedfinder, this is possible. we demonstrated that topic models can identify novel and insightful patterns in such data, providing an empirically grounded entry-point for researchers. this approach facilitated the experiential accounts of place to be brought to bear upon the purely quantitatively driven imd data. this novel combination of existing structural data and experiential vgi data enables us to systematically interpret the impact of materialsocio-economic factors on people’s experiences and concerns when breastfeeding in public. in particular, a key finding of this case study re-frames what breastfeeding parents may mean by privacy, and the material-factors, such as a separate room, cubicle, curtain or lockable-door, that populate the various individual regions of concern. furthermore, we empirically show, that these concerns are systematically different depending on the contextual factors of deprivation in the area as captured by the imd. as such, this paper contributes a reflexive process in which objective interpretation of data which preserves multiple subjectivities (as afforded through topic models) is positioned in dialogue with a more qualitative reading of the data, and through which user-generated data is used to ask questions of official data and vice versa.",224
Design Opportunities for AAC and Children with Severe Speech and Physical Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657939,"augmentative and alternative communication (aac) technologies can support children with severe speech and physical impairments (sspi) to express themselves. yet, these seemingly 'enabling' technologies are often abandoned by this target group, suggesting a need to understand how they are used in communication. little research has considered the interaction between people, interaction design and the material dimension of aac. to address this, we report on a qualitative video study that examines the situated communication of five children using aac in a special school. our findings offer a new perspective on reconceptualising aac design and use revealing four areas for future design: (1) incorporating an embodied view of communication, (2) designing to emphasise children's competence and agency, (3) regulating the presence, prominence and value of aac, and (4) supporting a wider range of communicative functions that help address children's needs. this paper reported a qualitative 14-week field study at a special school. our research aim was to examine how communication manifests in five children with sspi who use aac in school, and the mediating role of aac design. videos of communication incidents involving children and technology were collected. inductive video analysis was then carried out applying a multimodal and social semiotic approach. our analysis approached communication from three lenses: children’s choice of modes (a child view), their interactions with each other and technology (an interactional view), and the ordering of people and technology (a structural view). this enabled us to identify the kinds of communication achieved through and around aac and to unpack how the design of aac impacts on this communication. our paper contributes to the field of interaction design and aac research with four design opportunities: incorporating an embodied view of communication; designing to emphasise children’s competence and agency, regulating the presence, prominence and value of aac, and; supporting children in maintaining self-initiated communication. one methodological limitations we faced was the limited capture of repeated incidents of aac-mediated communication in naturally occurring interactions. additional research is needed from more diverse contexts to enrich our findings, in line with what stebbins calls concatenation i.e. incremental development of theory [39]. this could include considering the role of conversation partners and the impact of varied language displays on communication. our study should not be interpreted as providing clear solutions to this complex problem space, but rather identifying new avenues for a future design agenda that brings interaction designers closer to the concerns of young children with sspi who use technology. in particular, we hope that future design work will move beyond the transmission of information framing of technology to design for situated, embodied and coconstructed communication.",225
Facebook in Venezuela: Understanding Solidarity Economies in Low-Trust Environments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657930,"since 2014, venezuela has experienced severe economic crisis, including scarcity of basic necessities such as food and medicine. this has resulted in over-priced goods, scams, and other forms of economic abuse. we present an investigation of venezuelans' efforts to form an alternative, solidarity economy (se) through facebook groups. in these groups, individuals can barter for items at fair prices. we highlight group practices and design features of facebook groups which support solidarity or anti-solidarity behaviors. we conclude by leveraging design principles for online communities presented by kollock to present strategies to design more effective ses in environments of low trust. we have presented a review of venezuelan facebook bartering groups’ efforts to create an alternative, se to counteract an economy encumbered by bachaqueros and low trust. in doing so, we have highlighted areas of facebook groups which support solidarity and anti-solidarity behaviors, and in leveraging kollock we present strategies which can be implemented to better support the se movement in venezuela and other low-trust environments in the future. when mark zuckerberg first created a social site for college students at elite universities in 2004, he could not have anticipated that just over a decade later, his platform would play a significant role in basic survival for individuals in a prolonged economic crisis thousands of miles away in south america. it is a tribute to human ingenuity and resilience that software tools can be re-purposed in this way. analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of facebook groups for the purpose of bartering in extreme scarcity suggests a host of simple modifications that could make them work significantly better. there may be a viable economic model to motivate this software development, if facebook wishes to compete with marketplace-oriented sites, or it could be undertaken as a humanitarian effort. more broadly, providing users with more powerful, general-purpose, customizable tools can help empower people–in this crisis and crises of the future–to craft solutions for themselves.",226
Digital Payment and Its Discontents: Street Shops and the Indian Government's Push for Cashless Transactions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657931,"in november 2016, the government of india banned the vast majority of the nation's banknotes in a move referred to as 'demonetization', with the stated goals of fighting corruption, terrorism, and eventually expanding digital transactions. in this study of 200 shop-keepers in mumbai and bengaluru, we found that cash shortage increased digital payment adoption but that digital payments fell after new banknotes became available. digital payment adoption depended on the nature and scope of transactions, type of product sold, as well as personal factors specific to business owners such as comfort and familiarity with other digital technologies and online transactions. using theoretical work on market and information behavior, we examined environmental pushes for technology adoption against prevalent transactional practices, trust, and control. we propose that the move toward digital payments must be framed within a larger undertaking of technology-driven modernity that drives these initiatives, rather than just the efficiency or productivity gains digital payments present. our analysis of how shopkeepers coped with demonetization gives descriptive insight into the nature of technology adoption in state-mandated decisions. we found that digital payment adoption increased immediately following the crisis but fell after new banknotes became available. the participants in our study who continued to use digital payments did so based on the nature and scope of transactions, type of product they sold, and personal factors such as comfort and familiarity with other digital technologies and transactions. we found that when technology adoption pushes against existing practices it is resisted; such adoption should be examined within the larger context in which it is taking place because it is not solely about the user experience or platform. the work on hci4d has long looked at technology adoption either from the perspective of people’s needs and abilities or from that of socio-economic drivers. this research shows how a political agenda, enacted through a technological intervention, can be a lens into people’s acceptance or rejection of artifacts. we found that markets and entrenched practices are important considerations and that networks have effects on whether people try new things. we found that existing comfort with digital technology is an important indicator of new technology adoption, which further suggests that the information-poor and those with limited access to technology are less likely to be users. this, in turn, raises questions about the idea of technology and modernity and the scope of new technologies to change lives. the critical failing of the modi government was that while it made a number of sentimental appeals for technology adoption, it provided little compelling evidence that the cash economy was bad for people. on the contrary, respondents suggested the reverse was true.",227
Moving Target Selection: A Cue Integration Model,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657932,"this paper investigates a common task requiring temporal precision: the selection of a rapidly moving target on display by invoking an input event when it is within some selection window. previous work has explored the relationship between accuracy and precision in this task, but the role of visual cues available to users has remained unexplained. to expand modeling of timing performance to multimodal settings, common in gaming and music, our model builds on the principle of probabilistic cue integration. maximum likelihood estimation (mle) is used to model how different types of cues are integrated into a reliable estimate of the temporal task. the model deals with temporal structure (repetition, rhythm) and the perceivable movement of the target on display. it accurately predicts error rate in a range of realistic tasks. applications include the optimization of difficulty in game-level design. this paper has presented a theory and mathematical model for predicting error rates in moving target selection tasks. the model is derived from a known cognitive theory called cue integration theory. to explain how users form an integrated percept of a rapidly moving target, the theory builds on a probabilistic account of sensorimotor performance. it estimates an upper bound of performance achievable by a perfect decoder. across three studies, we have shown that this optimality assumption fits empirical data of trained users surprisingly well. this makes the model potentially useful in the design of gaming and music applications, where it can be used to design critical parameters like speeds, selection regions, and viewing times of moving targets.",228
Inferring Loop Invariants through Gamification,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657933,"in today's modern world, bugs in software systems incur significant costs. one promising approach to improve software quality is automated software verification. in this approach, an automated tool tries to prove the software correct once and for all. although significant progress has been made in this direction, there are still many cases where automated tools fail. we focus specifically on one aspect of software verification that has been notoriously hard to automate: inferring loop invariants that are strong enough to enable verification. in this paper, we propose a solution to this problem through gamification and crowdsourcing. in particular, we present a puzzle game where players find loop invariants without being aware of it, and without requiring any expertise on software verification. we show through an experiment with mechanical turk users that players enjoy the game, and are able to solve verification tasks that automated state-of-the-art tools cannot. we presented invgame, a game in which players guess loop invariants. we have shown that invgame allows players with no verification knowledge to verify benchmarks that leading automated tools cannot. we believe our minimalist design was one of the key factors contributing to its success: invgame directly leverages raw human mathematical skills. our promising results lay the path for a larger exploration into program verification through gamification and crowdsourcing.",229
CrowdLayout: Crowdsourced Design and Evaluation of Biological Network Visualizations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657934,"biologists often perform experiments whose results generate large quantities of data, such as interactions between molecules in a cell, that are best represented as networks (graphs). to visualize these networks and communicate them in publications, biologists must manually position the nodes and edges of each network to reflect their real-world physical structure. this process does not scale well, and graph layout algorithms lack the biological underpinnings to offer a viable alternative. in this paper, we present crowdlayout, a crowdsourcing system that leverages human intelligence and creativity to design layouts of biological network visualizations. crowdlayout provides design guidelines, abstractions, and editing tools to help novice workers perform like experts. we evaluated crowdlayout in two experiments with paid crowd workers and real biological network data, finding that crowds could both create and evaluate meaningful, high-quality layouts. we also discuss implications for crowdsourced design and network visualizations in other domains. network data is widely used in biological research, but creating meaningful visualizations of these networks is challenging for algorithms and typically requires significant time and expertise for biologists to perform manually. we presented crowdlayout, a system that leverages crowdsourced human intelligence and creativity to design layouts of biological network visualizations. crowdlayout uses design guidelines, abstractions, and special editing tools to help crowd workers without biological expertise create layouts that mimic real-world biological structures. the guidelines also serve as evaluation criteria for crowds to assess the quality of their layouts. in two experiments, we showed that crowds could design layouts that satisfy these guidelines as effectively as expert biologists, and crowds could also provide reviews of layouts that were similar to an expert. consequently, crowdlayout enables biological network visualization at scale, giving scientists access to meaningful visualizations of many more networks than they would be able to create manually, and potentially supporting new scientific breakthroughs.",230
Imaginary Design Workbooks: Constructive Criticism and Practical Provocation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657945,"his paper reports on design strategies for critical and experimental work that remains constructive. we report findings from a design workshop that explored the ""home hub"" space through ""imaginary design workbooks"". these feature ambiguous images and annotations written in an invented language to suggest a design space without specifying any particular idea. many of the concepts and narratives which emerged from the workshop focused on extreme situations: some thoughtful, some dystopian, some even mythic. one of the workshop ideas was then developed with a senior social worker who works with young offenders. a ""digital social worker"" concept was developed and critiqued simultaneously. we draw on foucault's history of surveillance to ""defamiliarise"" both the home hub technology and the current youth justice system. we argue that the dichotomy between ""constructive"" and ""critical"" design is false because design is never neutral. this paper has argued that the dichotomy between constructive and critical thinking is false. in order to be constructive thinking must be critical. home technologies that record the minutia of our lives are already with us. the question is not should these data be collected but how should they be used and regulated. in these kinds of “post privacy” spaces design must engage with political, ethical and legal issues. indeed, it already does, the question is whether designers are prepared to acknowledge this and take responsibility or not.",231
Drunk User Interfaces: Determining Blood Alcohol Level through Everyday Smartphone Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657946,"breathalyzers, the standard quantitative method for assessing inebriation, are primarily owned by law enforcement and used only after a potentially inebriated individual is caught driving. however, not everyone has access to such specialized hardware. we present drunk user interfaces: smartphone user interfaces that measure how alcohol affects a person's motor coordination and cognition using performance metrics and sensor data. we examine five drunk user interfaces and combine them to form the ""dui app"". dui uses machine learning models trained on human performance metrics and sensor data to estimate a person's blood alcohol level (bal). we evaluated dui on 14 individuals in a week-long longitudinal study wherein each participant used dui at various bals. we found that with a global model that accounts for user-specific learning, dui can estimate a person's bal with an absolute mean error of 0.005% ± 0.007% and a pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.96 with breathalyzer measurements. incidents involving inebriation often occur because they happen before an intervention can take place, highlighting the need for a blood alcohol level (bal) system more ubiquitous than a breathalyzer. we have introduced drunk user interfaces (duis), smartphone tasks that use sensing and human performance metrics to estimate a person’s bal. the combination of different duis led us to create the dui app, which utilizes machine learning on human performance and sensor data features to attain a more complete snapshot of the user’s current state. to evaluate dui, we conducted a rigorous longitudinal study in which participants used the app at different ground-truth bals. we trained models that accounted for learning and found that dui was able to estimate bal with an absolute mean error of 0.005% ± 0.007%. it is our hope that other researchers will recreate our study or improve upon it with their own tasks so that ubiquitous inebriation assessment might become a reality.",232
“That Really Pushes My Buttons”: Designing Bullying and Harassment Training for the Workplace,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657947,"workplace bullying and harassment have been identified as two of the most concerning silent and unseen occupational hazards of the 21st century. the design of bespoke training addressing domain-specific job roles and relations presents a particular challenge. using the concept of data-in-place where data is understood as being bound and produced by a particular place, this paper describes how locally-situated accounts can be used to engage employees in workplace-specific training seminars. using higher education as a case study, we describe a four-stage design process for future training efforts: (1) in-depth interviews for further understanding of bullying and harassment; (2) design of digital probes for capturing contextual data; (3) probe deployment and subsequent data analysis; (4) data-driven discussion-based seminars. we outline the potential for digital probes in promoting the denormalization of toxic workplace cultures, considerations for novel sensitive data governance models, and the discussion of data-in-place's temporal dimension. in the context of workplace training, e-learning courses have been seen as the virtual panacea for addressing the serious psychosocial hazards of bullying and harassment in higher education. through a series of interviews and digital probe deployments, this paper explored the possibility for a tailored employee training seminar design. using the concept of data-in-place, we have demonstrated the nuance and sensitivity to its environment through survivor-led approaches and sensitive data governance with considerations for future use of digital probes in the denormalization of toxic workplace cultures.",233
Taking into Account Sensory Knowledge: The Case of Geo-techologies for Children with Visual Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657948,"this paper argues for designing geo-technologies supporting non-visual sensory knowledge. sensory knowledge refers to the implicit and explicit knowledge guiding our uses of our senses to understand the world. to support our argument, we build on an 18 months field-study on geography classes for primary school children with visual impairments. our findings show (1) a paradox in the use of non-visual sensory knowledge: described as fundamental to the geography curriculum, it is mostly kept out of school; (2) that accessible geo-technologies in the literature mainly focus on substituting vision with another modality, rather than enabling teachers to build on children's experiences; (3) the importance of the hearing sense in learning about space. we then introduce a probe, a wrist-worn device enabling children to record audio cues during field-trips. by giving importance to children's hearing skills, it modified existing practices and actors' opinions on non-visual sensory knowledge. we conclude by reflecting on design implications, and the role of technologies in valuing diverse ways of understanding the world. in this paper, we argue for using the sensory turn as a lens to examine the learning experiences of children with visual impairments. we described the rich practices of teachers to teach children how to use their senses to understand their surroundings and construct geographic knowledge. however, teachers and children were conflicted about the value of this sensory knowledge, which we call the paradox of using nonvisual knowledge in the classroom. we designed a probe enabling children to make and play audio recordings during these field-trips, recordings that could then be displayed on an interactive map or other supports. through observations, we show changes in practices, and particularly increased agency for children. through follow-up interviews, we demonstrate a change in discourses, hinting at a re-evaluation of the auditory sensory knowledge of space. which confirms our initial stance: designing for a diversity of ways of learning and knowing contributes to enable the expression of marginalized views.",234
Understanding the Uncertainty in 1D Unidirectional Moving Target Selection,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657949,"in contrast to the extensive studies on static target pointing, much less formal understanding of moving target acquisition can be found in the hci literature. we designed a set of experiments to identify regularities in 1d unidirectional moving target selection, and found a ternary-gaussian model to be descriptive of the endpoint distribution in such tasks. the shape of the distribution as characterized by μ and σ in the gaussian model were primarily determined by the speed and size of the moving target. the model fits the empirical data well with 0.95 and 0.94 r2 values for μ and σ , respectively. we also demonstrated two extensions of the model, including 1) predicting error rates in moving target selection; and 2) a novel interaction technique to implicitly aid moving target selection. by applying them in a game interface design, we observed good performances in both predicting error rates (e.g., 2.7% mean absolute error) and assisting moving target selection (e.g., 33% or a greater increase in pointing accuracy). in this paper, we reported our work in understanding and modeling the endpoint distribution in 1d unidirectional moving targeting selection. we proposed a ternarygaussian model to interpret the distribution of the endpoints for targets moving in two horizontal directions. results show that our model fit the data very well. we also demonstrated how our model can be used to predict error rates and assist selection of moving targets. we observed good performance when applying these two means in a game interface design. as one of the first attempts to model human behavior uncertainty in moving target selection, our work provides the hci community with a theoretical foundation and empirical evidence for future research and design in such scenarios. for instance, when designing the difficulty curve of a game which the main challenge is to select moving targets, our model can be used to predict error and guide game designers to modify the game parameters such as healthy points, size and speed of the enemies. our model is not limited to gaming, in other animation systems (e.g., simulation systems, video monitoring system), our model can also be used to aid target selection on these systems in an implicit manner. in the future, we are interested in extending our research in several directions. first, we will examine whether our model can be transferred into user interfaces with interaction styles other than mouse (e.g., touch-based, pen-based, gesturebased). second, we will also pursue modeling uncertainty in selecting moving targets with changing speed and in 2d/3d space. furthermore, we will explore how our model can help to improve interaction efficiency in general user interfaces and compare it with other state-of-the-art pointing techniques (e.g., comet [11, 13] or bubble cursor [10]).",235
Agile 3D Sketching with Air Scaffolding,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657940,"hand motion and pen drawing can be intuitive and expressive inputs for professional digital 3d authoring. however, their inherent limitations have hampered wider adoption. 3d sketching using hand motion is rapid but rough, and 3d sketching using pen drawing is delicate but tedious. our new 3d sketching workflow combines these two in a complementary manner. the user makes quick hand motions in the air to generate approximate 3d shapes, and uses them as scaffolds on which to add details via pen-based 3d sketching on a tablet device. our air scaffolding technique and corresponding algorithm extract only the intended shapes from unconstrained hand motions. then, the user sketches 3d ideas by defining sketching planes on these scaffolds while appending new scaffolds, as needed. a user study shows that our progressive and iterative workflow enables more agile 3d sketching compared to ones using either hand motion or pen drawing alone. various computer graphics and 3d interaction techniques strive for more intuitive and expressive 3d modeling in design processes. in this study, we focused on the strengths and weaknesses of two salient input modalities and sought to develop a workflow in which the strengths of each are enforced and the weaknesses are complemented. our contribution is in recognizing that 3d sketching has no technique analogous to 2d scaffolding in 2d sketching. 3d authoring utilizing hand motion was used to roughly and quickly generate the desired scale and volume, and penbased 3d sketching was used to delicately specify finer features. from the extensive user study, we found that it is possible to design an interaction technique that coherently integrates different input modalities to enable rapid and highfidelity 3d conceptualization in a progressive and iterative workflow that the designers could satisfactorily use in practice.",236
KeyTime: Super-Accurate Prediction of Stroke Gesture Production Times,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657941,"we introduce keytime, a new technique and accompanying software for predicting the production times of users' stroke gestures articulated on touchscreens. keytime employs the principles and concepts of the kinematic theory, such as lognormal modeling of stroke gestures' velocity profiles, to estimate gesture production times significantly more accurately than existing approaches. our experimental results obtained on several public datasets show that keytime predicts user-independent production times that correlate r=.99 with groundtruth from just one example of a gesture articulation, while delivering an average error in the predicted time magnitude that is 3 to 6 times smaller than that delivered by clc, the best prediction technique up to date. moreover, keytime reports a wide range of useful statistics, such as the trimmed mean, median, standard deviation, and confidence intervals, providing practitioners with unprecedented levels of accuracy and sophistication to characterize their users' a priori time performance with stroke gesture input. keytime is a new high-performing technique informed by the kinematic theory that delivers very accurate predictions of users’ stroke gesture production times. through careful evaluations, we showed that keytime’s predictions are very close to the actual production times of stroke gestures articulated by real users. moreover, keytime only requires one gesture example that designers can produce themselves, and is readily available to any practitioner both as an online application and a restful json api. keytime also raises the bar for future research on stroke gesture time prediction and analysis by delivering a wide palette of predictors of location and dispersion for production times. it is our hope that keytime will provide researchers, designers, and practitioners with unprecedented levels of accuracy and sophistication to characterize their users’ a priori time performance with stroke gesture input, informing better gesture user interface designs.",237
Entrepreneurship and the Socio-Technical Chasm in a Lean Economy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657942,"online technologies are increasingly hailed as enablers of entrepreneurship and income generation. recent evidence suggests, however, that even the best such tools disproportionately favor those with pre-existing entrepreneurial advantages. despite intentions, the technology on its own seems far from addressing socio-economic inequalities. using participatory action research, we investigated why this might be, in an intimate, close-up context. over a 1-year period, we--a collaborative team of university researchers and residents of detroit's east side--worked to establish a neighborhood tour whose initial goal was to raise supplementary income and fundraise for community block clubs. we found that in addition to technical requirements, such as communication tools, a range of non-technological efforts is needed to manage projects, build self-efficacy, and otherwise support community participants. our findings widen ackerman's ""socio-technical gap"" for some contexts and offer a counterpoint to overgeneralized claims about well-designed technologies being able to address certain classes of social challenges. this study (1) confirmed past technical requirements such as the need for tools to obtain financial and social capital; (2) identified new technical requirements such as the need for tools to support incubation (e.g., set price points) and support human capital (e.g., instill a sense of independence, foster self-efficacy). this study additionally (3) uncovered hidden, non-technical requirements such as the need for support during personal challenges; social support and direct interaction to build trust for entrepreneurial success among novice entrepreneurs in lean economies. we found issues around trust and motivation to be particularly challenging for technology to address, at least for the foreseeable future. and while dramatic new technologies—such as robots indistinguishable from people—might prompt a reassessment, our conclusion for the moment is that supporting people in lean economies toward entrepreneurship and other forms of social-economic growth requires resources applied toward human interventions, rather than the pursuit of tempting technological mirages. these results deepen our understanding of ackerman’s social-technical gap, and contribute implications for both civic technologists and policy-makers hoping to support entrepreneurship in lean economies.",238
VirtualSpace - Overloading Physical Space with Multiple Virtual Reality Users,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657943,"although virtual reality hardware is now widely available, the uptake of real walking is hindered by the fact that it requires often impractically large amounts of physical space. to address this, we present virtualspace, a novel system that allows overloading multiple users immersed in different vr experiences into the same physical space. virtualspace accomplishes this by containing each user in a subset of the physical space at all times, which we call tiles; app-invoked maneuvers then shuffle tiles and users across the entire physical space. this allows apps to move their users to where their narrative requires them to be while hiding from users that they are confined to a tile. we show how this enables virtualspace to pack four users into 16m2. in our study we found that virtualspace allowed participants to use more space and to feel less confined than in a control condition with static, pre-allocated space. we presented virtualspace, a technique for overloading multiple real walking vr users into the same physical space. virtualspace achieves this by containing each app in a smaller tile. frequent “maneuvers” allow apps to incentivize their users to walk across the entire physical space, thereby allowing each app to progress its narrative and to prevent users from noticing that they are confined to a tile. this strategy enables virtualspace to achieve packings of the unprecedented density of four users in 16m2 as we demonstrated in our user study.",239
Effects of Socially Stigmatized Crowdfunding Campaigns in Shaping Opinions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657944,"donation-based crowdfunding platforms have an increasing number of campaigns on socially stigmatized topics. these platforms' widespread online reachability and the large flow of monetary donations have the potential to shape individuals' opinions by influencing their perceptions. however, little research has been done to investigate whether these campaigns impact individuals' opinions and how. we conducted an experiment to explore how an attitude-inconsistent campaign on fairness and equality for lgbtiq people influenced participants' opinion on this topic. although all the participants changed their perceived opinions after reading the support for the campaigns, participants opposing equality were less inclined to change their attitude than participants supporting equality. to examine this difference further, we conducted another experiment where participants were exposed to both attitude-consistent and attitude-inconsistent campaigns with varying levels of social support. participants opposing equality showed less sensitivity to the level of social support, and wanted to donate significantly more money to anti-equality campaigns compared to those who supported equality. results demonstrate the complex role of crowdfunding campaigns in shaping individuals' opinions on stigmatized topics. in conclusion, we, as researchers, are not in a position to support the point of view of any group over the other. rather, we believe that our work will contribute to the large body of literature on social polarization and selective exposure by revealing the complex dynamics of information on stigmatized topics and the pre-existing attitudes of people. given the potential impact of crowdfunding platforms on social opinions, we need more research to fully understand how various online media are contributing to shaping the opinions of the people on stigmatized topics, and how this will affect the aggregated social opinion of a community. we believe that our findings provide an important starting point for the research community to increase their awareness of the complex influence of crowdfunding campaigns on shaping social opinions on stigmatized social issues.",240
A Design Framework for Awareness Cues in Distributed Multiplayer Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657055,"in the physical world, teammates develop situation awareness about each other's location, status, and actions through cues such as gaze direction and ambient noise. to support situation awareness, distributed multiplayer games provide awareness cues - information that games automatically make available to players to support cooperative gameplay. the design of awareness cues can be extremely complex, impacting how players experience games and work with teammates. despite the importance of awareness cues, designers have little beyond experiential knowledge to guide their design. in this work, we describe a design framework for awareness cues, providing insight into what information they provide, how they communicate this information, and how design choices can impact play experience. our research, based on a grounded theory analysis of current games, is the first to provide a characterization of awareness cues, providing a palette for game designers to improve design practice and a starting point for deeper research into collaborative play. we see this paper as setting out a research agenda for awareness cues in distributed multiplayer games, improving the relevance of our work to both designers and researchers. first, existing team awareness cues build on common design patterns, both within a particular game genre and across different genres. from this basic language for awareness cues, we can begin to describe the existing set of design patterns for awareness cues that already exist. game design patterns are useful to facilitate and analyze designs [3], and can also be used to identify negative space in a design space: places where patterns ought to exist but do not. game design patterns can therefore improve existing distributed awareness cues as well as driving discovery of new patterns and designs. we can use these patterns to analyze, improve, and push forward specific aspects of games. one clear axis is looking at different categories of games—either looking at specific genres such as mobas, or looking at games that share common features, such as turn-based play. another direction is to compare different categories of players, for example understanding what awareness cues are associated with different player roles or how they are deployed differently for experts and novices. finally, we can look at different types of information, such as how nominal versus continuous information is deployed. second, we can extend our framework beyond team awareness. when players make decisions, they need to understand their teammates, but, their decisions also incorporate information about themselves, their adversaries, the environment, nonplayer characters (npcs) and the game system. finally, we expect to bring this work full circle, by applying these insights in other types of distributed workspaces. specifically, we expect fast-response organizations, like disaster responders, to benefit from this work. further, we expect other types of groupware (e.g., distributed document editing) can use our work to identify new awareness cues. the present research contributes to our knowledge of how team members work together, and how teamwork can be supported. we expect our framework to be of value to game designers and researchers, and hope that, through this work, we discover new ways to support team coordination.",241
Empowerment in HCI - A Survey and Framework,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657056,"empowering people through technology is of increasing concern in the hci community. however, there are different interpretations of empowerment, which diverge substantially. the same term thus describes an entire spectrum of research endeavours and goals. this conceptual unclarity hinders the development of a meaningful discourse and exchange. to better understand what empowerment means in our community, we reviewed 54 chi full papers using the terms empower and empowerment. based on our analysis and informed by prior writings on power and empowerment, we construct a framework that serves as a lens to analyze notions of empowerment in current hci research. finally, we discuss the implications of these notions of empowerment on approaches to technology design and offer recommendations for future work. with this analysis, we hope to add structure and terminological clarity to this growing and important facet of hci research. in this work, we reviewed papers on empowerment in hci, constructed a framework grounded in work on power and empowerment, and described different lines of research prevalent in our community. our analysis revealed that notions on power and empowerment differ greatly between eight lines of research. to inspire a more structured discussion about the concept of empowerment, we provided several recommendations which we hope may guide this dialogue. we strongly believe that the turn towards empowerment in hci has the potential to influence technology design for the better. however, to utilize this potential in a responsible way, in each individual case, it 1) requires a definition of the underlying maxim and goal of empowerment and 2) an evaluation to what extent the envisioned goal has been reached. unchallenged calls can entail the risk of becoming a mantra and lead to ineffective (and potentially detrimental) design choices. appropriate metrics are required to prevent such negative effects and ensure the effectiveness of the chosen form of empowerment. they are also needed as a foundation for design guides and best practices and to differentiate between effective and ineffective approaches of empowerment. in order to develop such metrics, a clear understanding of empowerment is needed: who is the target group, which are the targeted psychological components, do we aim for an increase in power or a decrease in power difference? in zimmerman’s words, “the development of a universal and global measure of empowerment is not an appropriate goal because it may not mean the same thing for every person, organization, or community everywhere.” [100]. our framework provides starting points for finding these metrics. but more than that, we hope to have highlighted the need to consciously reflect on the notions of power and empowerment researchers want to adopt for their project.",242
Multiray: Multi-Finger Raycasting for Large Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657057,"we explore and evaluate a multi-finger raycasting design space that we call ""multiray"". each finger projects a ray on to the display, so the user is interacting from a distance using a form of direct input. specifically, we propose techniques, where patterns of ray intersections created by hand postures form 2d geometric shapes to trigger actions and perform direct manipulations that go beyond single-point selections. two formative studies examine characteristics of multi-finger raycasting for different projection methods, shapes, and tasks. based on the results of those investigations, we demonstrate a number of dynamic ui controls and operations that utilise multiray points and shapes. we presented multiray, or multi-finger raycasting to interact remotely with large displays. as motivated in the introduction, we believe multiray fills a hole in the raycasting design space similar to multitouch filling a hole relative to single touch. while we do not mean to also imply multiray is automatically a significant intuitive leap like multitouch, we hope our work shows that people can use multiray to increase expressivity compared to single ray. we conducted two formative experiments to examine various properties of the technique. our main findings are: 1) raycasting from the entire finger (mcp to tip) is more efficient than from just the distal phalanx (dip to tip). 2) there are signs that single-point targeting with multiple fingers can compensate for noise, but our results were not statistically significant. 3) horizontal shapes are faster and preferred by people. 4) short corners and lines are the most efficient shapes. 5) circle and rectangles are generally less efficient but they also have a high variability among users. 6) circles are easiest to maintain during motion. 7) people can be initially troubled by the fact that shapes produced on the screen do not always match the physical postures of their hand. based on those experiments, we created three applications demonstrating several multiray interactions for common operations. our work paves the way towards future evaluations in context, with more shapes and possibly in coexistence with other non-ray gestures to address the shortcomings that we identified. a further avenue to explore would be to introduce biases towards particular shapes (thus departing from absolute raycasting) so as to facilitate their detection and the correspondence with the physical posture of the hand. finally, as with any mid-air gesture or single-finger raycasting technique, fatigue is an important aspect that needs to be taken into consideration and rigorously assessed.",243
Feel the Movement: Real Motion Influences Responses to Take-over Requests in Highly Automated Vehicles,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657058,"take-over requests (tors) in highly automated vehicles are cues that prompt users to resume control. tors however, are often evaluated in non-moving driving simulators. this ignores the role of motion, an important source of information for users who have their eyes off the road while engaged in non-driving related tasks. we ran a user study in a moving-base driving simulator to investigate the effect of motion on tor responses. we found that with motion, user responses to tors vary depending on the road context where tors are issued. while previous work showed that participants are fast to respond to urgent cues, we show that this is true only when tors are presented on straight roads. urgent cues issued on curved roads elicit slower responses than non-urgent cues on curved roads. our findings indicate that tors should be designed to be aware of road context to accommodate natural user responses. in this paper, we investigated whether real motion inuenced users’ responses to tors. this was motivated by the fact that many evaluations and user studies of tors tend to be performed in xed-base simulators, which might grossly underestimate situational awareness of the driving scene during non-driving. indeed, we found that users responded faster and demonstrated better take-over control when motion was available. while they were generally faster in responding to tors that were designed to be more urgent (cf., [3, 27, 41]), this was not the full story. when real motion was provided, users took more time to respond to urgent tors that were presented in curved road segments. this highlights the fact that users are sensitive to kinesthetic information from the driving scene, even if they are visually engaged with a non-driving activity. thus, tors should be designed to take this into account and to support decision-making post tor presentation, given the assumption that users of highly automated vehicles are likely to be aware of road conditions such as road curvature. finally, we provide some recommendations for providing continuous cueing of the driving scene besides motion that might similarly support situational awareness without interfering with non-driving activity.",244
HomeFinder Revisited: Finding Ideal Homes with Reachability-Centric Multi-Criteria Decision Making,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657059,"finding an ideal home is a difficult and laborious process. one of the most crucial factors in this process is the reachability between the home location and the concerned points of interest, such as places of work and recreational facilities. however, such importance is unrecognized in the extant real estate systems. by characterizing user requirements and analytical tasks in the context of finding ideal homes, we designed reach, a novel visual analytics system that assists people in finding, evaluating, and choosing a home based on multiple criteria, including reachability. in addition, we developed an improved data-driven model for approximating reachability with massive taxi trajectories. this model enables users to interactively integrate their knowledge and preferences to make judicious and informed decisions. we show the improvements in our model by comparing the theoretical complexities with the prior study and demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of the proposed system with task-based evaluation. this study characterizes the problem of reachability-centric multi-criteria decision-making for choosing ideal homes. to assist users in expressing their preferences, we introduce several reachability concepts involved in this problem, including activities and constraints. we propose a new graph-based mining model that significantly extends the state-of-the-art method [39] to achieve real-time performance. we used the model as basis to design and develop a novel data-driven system called reach. to the best of our knowledge, reach is the first interactive visualization system for people to find an ideal home based on massive urban data. the proposed system has been deployed on a local workstation. in the future, we intend to deploy this system as a cloud service on the web. the mining model will be improved to reduce the space complexity, thereby lowering the cost for the cloud deployment. other types of data, which are of interest to people, will be incorporated to the proposed system.",245
SpaceTokens: Interactive Map Widgets for Location-centric Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657050,"map users often need to interact repetitively with multiple important locations. for example, a traveler may frequently check her hotel or a train station on a map, use them to localize an unknown location, or investigate routes involving them. ironically, these location-centric tasks cannot be performed using locations directly; users must instead pan and zoom the map or use a menu to access locations. we propose spacetokens, interactive widgets that act as clones of locations, and which users can create and place on map edges like virtual whiteboard magnets. spacetokens make location a first-class citizen of map interaction. they empower users to rapidly perform location-centric tasks directly using locations: users can select combinations of on-screen locations and spacetokens to control the map window, or connect them to create routes. participants in a study overwhelmingly preferred a spacetokens prototype over google maps on identical smartphones for the majority of tasks. we have asked the question, “why can’t map users perform location-centric tasks directly using locations?” to answer it, we introduced spacetokens, interactive widgets that make location a first-class citizen of map interaction. spacetokens empower users to perform location-centric tasks rapidly. we explored using locations as constraints to address the seeing problem, and using locations as building blocks to address the linking problem. building on the idea of making location a first-class citizen, we also presented spacebar, a scrollbar-like navigational instrument that leverages decades of work on scrollbars to help users interact with a route. we implemented spacetokens and related tools in a prototype ios application. in a qualitative user study, we evaluated the prototype application on an iphone in comparison with google maps. participants overwhelmingly preferred the approaches used in our prototype for the majority of the tasks they tried. ultimately, we envision spatial entities in general (locations, paths, areas) could be first-class citizens of map interaction.",246
M3 Gesture Menu: Design and Experimental Analyses of Marking Menus for Touchscreen Mobile Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657051,"despite their learning advantages in theory, marking menus have faced adoption challenges in practice, even on today's touchscreen-based mobile devices. we address these challenges by designing, implementing, and evaluating multiple versions of m3 gesture menu (m3), a reimagination of marking menus targeted at mobile interfaces. m3 is defined on a grid rather than in a radial space, relies on gestural shapes rather than directional marks, and has constant and stationary space use. our first controlled experiment on expert performance showed m3 was faster and less error-prone by a factor of two than traditional marking menus. a second experiment on learning demonstrated for the first time that users could successfully transition to recall-based execution of a dozen commands after three ten-minute practice sessions with both m3 and multi-stroke marking menu. together, m3, with its demonstrated resolution, learning, and space use benefits, contributes to the design and understanding of menu selection in the mobile-first era of end-user computing. in this paper, we proposed m3 gesture menu, a variant of the marking menu that is defined on grids rather than radial space, relies on gestural shapes rather than directional marks, and has constant and stationary space use so as to fit the mobile form factor. in addition, gestures in m3 are more robustly recognized using a shape matching algorithm than aggregating stroke direction results as in conventional marking menus. two experiments were conducted to understand m3’s menu resolution and novice to expert transition behavior. compared to the literature, m3 exhibited much higher resolution than traditional marking menu and the revised multi-stroke marking menu. we estimated that m3 was at least twice as fast and twice more accurate than traditional marking menu and at least twice as fast as multi-stroke marking menu at a comparable accuracy. furthermore, m3 was designed for mobile phone’s relatively small screen and tested with the finger rather than the more precise stylus. because gestures are unistrokes, m3 does not need a dedicated, occlusive space to disambiguate the menu interaction from other overlapping graphical elements as multi-stroke marking menu does. we also for the first time, to our knowledge, systematically examined and demonstrated empirically successful user behavior transition from novice to expert mode. users of m3 and multi-stroke marking menu were able to switch from visually-guided use to recall-based gesture articulation for a dozen commands after a total of 30-minute practice over three days. subjectively, most but not all users preferred m3 over other alternatives. they found m3 to provide more fluid interaction flow, facilitate memorization of commands with expressive shape gestures, and enable more compact space use. we also found on average it took only seven trials of use before users could switch from novice to expert behavior with m3 and multi-stroke marking menu. there is a cost to learning these marking menus because in the novice mode, they took a longer time to execute than a linear menu did. we estimated the time cost and saving equilibrium point for m3 versus linear menus at about 30 trials of use, after which each trial of use translates to estimated time savings of 1.7 seconds. future designer and researchers may use these first-order approximations in their design context to estimate the cost and benefit of adopting menu innovations like m3. in sum, by incorporating innovative features such as shape recognition, m3 gesture menu offers a more practical working solution for applying marking menu concepts on to touchscreen mobile devices. our work also makes foundational contributions to future menu system design and research with empirical findings of m3 and marking menus’ resolution and learning characteristics.",247
Queer Visibility: Supporting LGBT+ Selective Visibility on Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657052,"lgbt+ people adjust the presentation of their gender and sexual identities in response to social pressures, but their level of visibility differs between social media. we interviewed seventeen lgbt+ students at a socially-conservative university to investigate: (1) how do social media affect lgbt+ user experience of managing self presentation; and (2) how do social media affect participation in lgbt+ communities? we develop implications for design to support queering social media. (1) give people abilities to present themselves with selective visibility, enabling choices about privacy and sharing, in contrast with the hci design principle of indiscriminate 'making visible'. that is, enable participants to define their social media identities in their own ways. (2) conduct studies, with a methodology likewise ensures that participants can define their gender and sexual identities in their own ways, rather than according to a predetermined vocabulary. we interviewed seventeen lgbt+ students in a conservative town in order to see: • how do social media affect lgbt+ user experience of managing self presentation? • how do social media affect participation in lgbt+ communities? we described our participants with their own words to prevent our assumptions from limiting their responses. from our findings, we developed implications for design that emphasize the value of legitimizing the use of multiple profiles and obscuring activities by default. although our findings are from a small group of lgbt+ students in a conservative town, they are informative about how lgbt+ users manage their self presentation online. we join other research that values lgbt+ experiences as informative for design [16, 19]. in networked publics, it is impossible to prevent the spread of information. although obscuring user activities with opt-in design cannot prevent all unwanted disclosure, changing the default behavior in a networked public may create new social media places, where lgbt+ users can relax about their visibility. we are optimistic that social media can be (re)designed to give lgbt+ users more agency to be selectively visible so they are more able to gain the benefits of participation on social media [31, 5, 30]. we are especially concerned about the ways in which realname, single-user policies limit that ways in which participants can identity themselves, because those policies seem to impose publicly sanitized, heteronormative performances. butler’s theory of performativity suggests that the sanitized performances could become new, problematic norms that sanction only the performances facebook (and other sites with real-name policies) allow. broadly, our design implications contribute to supporting user’s selective visibility on social media via increased default privacy in contrast with the hci design principle of indiscriminate ‘making visible.’ through selective visibility, users are empowered to make decisions regarding sharing vs. privacy of potentially sensitive aspects of their identities. these findings were supported by a study methodology, in which we intentionally enabled participants to define their identities in their own ways. during interviews, we avoided giving users a set vocabulary by which they could identify, and participants described identities we did not anticipate. we suggest that other researchers allow participants to identify freely whenever possible, so that they do not limit participant’s answers to the researcher’s expectations. designers need to be sensitive, giving marginalized participants agency in vital aspects of self presentation. queer seeks to “address the margins, but not perhaps as conceived, since it deals with them by repositioning them” [25]. we address the margins by privileging lgbt+ experiences as informative for the design of social media.",248
Bento Browser: Complex Mobile Search Without Tabs,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657053,"people engaged in complex searches such as planning a vacation or understanding their medical symptoms are often overwhelmed by opening and managing many tabs. these challenges are exacerbated as search moves to smartphones and mobile devices where screen real-estate is limited and tasks are frequently suspended, resumed, and interleaved. rather than continue to utilize tab-based browsing for complex search, we introduce a new way of browsing through a scaffolded interface. the list of search results serves as a mutable workspace, where a user can track progress on a specific information query. the search query serves as a gateway into this workspace, accessed through a task-subtask hierarchy. we instantiate this in the bento mobile search system and investigate its effectiveness in three studies. we find converging evidence that users were able to make progress on their complex searching tasks with this structure, and find it more organized and easier to revisit. we performed three studies to evaluate the use and usefulness of bento in web search. across a controlled lab study, qualitatively-focused deployment, and quantitatively-focused deployment, we found evidence that users appreciated both the task based organization interface, as well as the search results workspace interface. together, these consistently made users feel more organized and feel like they could resume their activities more easily. based on these findings, we also have a couple of additional takeaways. users appeared to use a few strategies, aligned with many goal activation theory approaches [1]. for example, in study 2 p4 noted that she queued up searches for later exploration, largely a prospective planning task. conversely, we had individuals like p2 and p3 who didn’t really understand the to-read feature, another planning tool we had incorporated into our design. this suggests that different user populations might practice different planning techniques for their exploratory searches, and while the structure appeared to be amenable to most of them, having tools for both planning and retrospective recounting could be essential to the design of these systems. this information was similar to what was found in study 3 with user preference for different features of the system. most users liked the overall organization for easy re-finding, however some users liked the specific planning features, such as the to-read feature and the grey progress bars. supporting both of these resumption use cases will be key proceeding forward. we had several complaints from users about the overhead of bento for simpler searches. in both studies 2 and 3, individuals noted that they wish they didn’t have to make an entire task card for just simple searches. however, in some of our interviews, individuals noted that their simple searches, such as looking up an actor in a movie, often blossomed into more complex searches, such as looking at what else that actor was in, what roles they typically play, etc. having a low overhead, while also supporting this transition of simple search into complex search was an issue in bento that was not entirely resolved.",249
Chibitronics in the Wild: Engaging New Communities in Creating Technology with Paper Electronics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657054,"we share a study on the public adoption the chibitronics circuit sticker toolkit, an open source, commercially available hardware toolkit for learning and creating electronics on paper. we examine sales data over a two-and-a-half-year period from november 2013, when the kit was launched commercially, to june 2016. we also look at publicly available project documentation from users during this period. we find that the chibitronics user community confounds norms for traditional technology-making communities, especially in gender demographics. we explore the artifacts and types of documentation produced by users to learn about the various backgrounds, values, and goals of subcommunities, which includes educators, makers, and crafters. in particular, we focus on artifacts from the craft community as a surprising and distinctive subset of technology creators. the diversity in public engagement shows how paper electronics tools like chibitronics can be an effective approach for engaging new and broader audiences to participate in technology creation. in this paper we have shared an early look at how, like the e-textile community, the paper electronics community may offer new pathways to engaging more diverse participants in designing and creating technologies. we examined chibitronics customers and users as a representative subset of the greater paper electronics creative community. as we continue this research, we are particularly are excited to learn more about creators from the craft community as an emerging node of technology creators and how their adoption may lead to insights for foster overall access, adoption and cultural relevance of crafted electronic technologies as an engineering practice.",250
A Trip to the Moon: Personalized Animated Movies for Self-reflection,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657065,"self-tracking physiological and psychological data poses the challenge of presentation and interpretation. insightful narratives for self-tracking data can motivate the user towards constructive self-reflection. one powerful form of narrative that engages audience across various culture and age groups is animated movies. we collected a week of self-reported mood and behavior data from each user and created in unity a personalized animation based on their data. we evaluated the impact of their video in a randomized control trial with a non-personalized animated video as control. we found that personalized videos tend to be more emotionally engaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indicated self-reflection about moods and behaviors, compared to non-personalized control videos. converting personal data into a format that can have emotional impact can potentially fuel motivation for self-reflection and positive behavior change; however, a fully-automated system is not capable today of understanding human personal experiences at the kind of level that could make such a story both explicit and accurate. to solve this challenge, we built an automated system to construct an animation that is personalized to the data provided by an individual over a week, utilizing an animated avatar (corgi) that implicitly reflects the person’s behaviors, such as sleep and social interactions, and moods associated with each day of the week. we conducted two studies: the first found that the avatar’s portrayal of a set of moods and behaviors could be perceived accurately in general. the second study tested the emotional engagement of using a personalized story against a challenging control: a similar story that they were told was personalized. the results indicated that personalized animations tended to be more emotionally engaging, encouraging greater and lengthier writing that indicated self-reflection about moods and behaviors. furthermore, while human imagination plays an important and valuable part in both conditions – test and control – the impact we found suggests that true personalization may be more powerfully influential on moods and self-reflection than simply believing that one is receiving personalized feedback.",251
Coco's Videos: An Empirical Investigation of Video-Player Design Features and Children's Media Use,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657066,"in this study, we present coco's videos, a video-viewing platform for preschoolers designed to support them in learning to self-manage their media consumption. we report results from a three-week experimental deployment in 24 homes in which preschoolers used three different versions of the platform: one that is neutral to the limits they set, one that enforces the limits they set, and one that attempts to erode the limits they set by automatically playing additional content after the planned content is finished (""post-play""). we found that post-play significantly reduced children's autonomy and likelihood of self-regulation, extended video-viewing time, and led to increases in parent intervention. we found that the lock-out mechanism did not reduce video-viewing time or the likelihood of parent intervention. together, our results suggest that avoiding platforms that work to undermine the user's intentions is more likely to help children self-regulate their media use than rigid parental controls. today’s preschoolers will come of age in a world of constantly connected devices that will provide them with the opportunity to plug in at almost any moment. for these children, defining how they want to engage with this media ecosystem and managing their ongoing media consumption is likely to forever be a part of daily life. in this study, we present one possible alternative to today’s parental controls, in which we move away from the traditionally authoritarian designs of this space. our results show that through design, we can support children in becoming autonomous users. or, through features like post-play, we can undermine their ability to self-regulate. child participants consistently showed evidence of wanting to take ownership of their transitions, and they demonstrated agency in both engaging and disengaging with technology. we conclude that the design community does not need to create tools to police excessive media use—we simply need to stop designing experiences to encourage it.",252
ResearchIME: A Mobile Keyboard Application for Studying Free Typing Behaviour in the Wild,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657067,"we present a data logging concept, tool, and analyses to facilitate studies of everyday mobile touch keyboard use and free typing behaviour: 1) we propose a filtering concept to log typing without recording readable text and assess reactions to filters with a survey (n=349). 2) we release an android keyboard app and backend that implement this concept. 3) based on a three-week field study (n=30), we present the first analyses of keyboard use and typing biometrics on such free text typing data in the wild, including speed, postures, apps, auto correction, and word suggestions. we conclude that research on mobile keyboards benefits from observing free typing beyond the lab and discuss ideas for further studies. mobile touschreen typing has mostly been studied in the lab with transcription tasks. to facilitate free text entry studies in the wild, we developed a logging concept and keyboard app. a survey (n=349) assessed views on related privacy filters. we deployed our app in a three-week field study (n=30) and presented the first analyses of keyboard use and typing biometrics in free text composition in the wild, including speed, postures, apps, auto correction, and word suggestions. finally, is it worth the effort for researchers to collect typing data from free text composition in everyday life? we believe the answer is yes, it is a valuable additional method. as the hci community follows diverse research interests with regard to text entry, the study choice should be aligned with those: the lab transcription task is practical if one is mainly interested in speed and error rates, for example to compare a novel text entry method to a baseline. however, as related work showed [52], these tasks should also be conducted in the field. on the other hand, our study showed individual differences: for example, a lab study might enforce a fixed (common) hand posture, but we found that some people prefer other postures than the majority. similar observations hold for device orientation, use of word suggestions, and typing activity throughout the day. moreover, users’ favourite posture in our questionnaire differed from the one they actually reported most often while typing. our results also suggest that the biometric value of typing behaviour shows in different features in free typing in the wild compared to transcription in the lab. in conclusion, we see great value in studying unconstrained typing in users’ daily lives to capture user-specific behaviour. this fits research agendas on adaptive and personalised keyboards and on typing biometrics. moreover, such data may help to address the challenge of designing for special user groups and varying contexts of use [39, 40].",253
Wearables for Learning: Examining the Smartwatch as a Tool for Situated Science Reflection,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657068,"relatively little research exists on the use of smartwatches to support learning. this paper presents an approach for commodity smartwatches as a tool for situated reflection in elementary school science. the approach was embodied in a smartwatch app called sciencestories that allows students to voice record reflections about science concepts anytime, anywhere. we conducted a study with 18 fifth-grade children to investigate first, the effects of sciencestories on students' science self-efficacy, and second the effects of different motivational structures (gamification, narrative-based, hybrid) designed into the smartwatch app on students' quality and quantity of use. quantitative results showed sciencestories increased science self-efficacy especially with a motivational structure. the gamified version had the highest quantity of use, while narrative performance performed worst. qualitative findings described how students' recordings related to science topics and were contextualized. we discuss how our findings contribute to understanding of how to design smartwatch apps for educational purposes. we proposed an approach that frames the smartwatch as a tool for situated reflection to support informal science learning in everyday life for elementary school students. we incorporated different kinds of motivational structures into the design of the sciencestories educational smartwatch app, to explore ways to promote app use over time. our study showed that the smartwatch as a situated reflection tool positively affects science self-efficacy and elicited the richness of students’ in-situ smartwatch science recordings. much research has shown that self-efficacy is an important predictor of academic performance as well as amount of persistence in school work [68]. however, none of the app versions excelled in all dimensions. the gamified app appeared to be the best compromise in terms of generating sufficient recordings with some connection to the science concept, and resulting in increased science self-efficacy as compared to traditional classroom instruction. more work has to be done to investigate smartwatch effects on actual learning or knowledge increase. as of now, we have barely begun to scrape the surface of the untapped potential of smartwatches for education. with its new set of characteristics focusing on persistent presence on the wearer, the smartwatch may allow teachers in the future to address and scaffold students’ learning in spatial and temporal contexts way beyond the classroom.",254
Investigating How Online Help and Learning Resources Support Children's Use of 3D Design Software,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657069,"3d design software is increasingly available to children through libraries, maker spaces, and for free on the web. this unprecedented availability has the potential to unleash children's creativity in cutting edge domains, but is limited by the steep learning curve of the software. unfortunately, there is little past work studying the breakdowns faced by children in this domain-most past work has focused on adults in professional settings. in this paper, we present a study of online learning resources and help-seeking strategies available to children starting out with 3d design software. we find that children face a range of challenges when trying to learn 3d design independently-tutorials present instructions at a granularity that leads to overlooked and incorrectly-performed actions, and online help-seeking is largely ineffective due to challenges with query formulation and evaluating found information. based on our findings, we recommend design directions for next-generation help and learning systems tailored to children. as 3d design tools are increasingly being used by non-professional users, including children, hobbyists, and casual makers, there is a need to refine and update our understanding of how to design software help and learning tools to accommodate these new user populations. this paper provides a first step toward establishing a better understanding of children’s learning and help-seeking behaviors with 3d design software, and we believe that our findings can serve as a foundation for developing next-generation help and learning systems to enable children to learn and improve 3d design skills.",255
Tactile Information Transmission by 2D Stationary Phantom Sensations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657060,"a phantom sensation refers to an illusory tactile sensation perceived midway between multiple distant stimulations on the skin. phantom sensations have been used intensively in tactile interfaces owing to their simplicity and effectiveness. despite that, the perceptual performance of phantom sensations is not completely understood, especially for 2d cases. this work is concerned with 2d stationary phantom sensations and their fundamental value as a means for information display. in user study 1, we quantified the information transmission capacity using an absolute identification task of 2d phantom sensations. in user study 2, we probed the distributions of the actual perceived positions of 2d phantom sensations. the investigations included both types of phantom sensations-within and out of the body. our results provide general guidelines as to leveraging 2d phantom sensations in the design of spatial tactile display. in this paper, we have investigated the absolute identification performance and the continuous localization accuracy of 2d stationary phantom sensations applied to the hands. for clear perception of the illusory sensations, vibration modules were designed to provide localized vibrations using an effective attenuation layer and attached to the four corners of a smart phone held in one hand (phone). in the other configuration (ring), vibration modules were worn in the index and ring fingers of both hands, eliciting out-of-the-body phantom sensations in the empty space between the hands. two user studies carried out to evaluate the perceptual performance of the two kinds of 2d stationary phantom sensations disclosed several important findings, as follows: 1. the identification performance of 2d stationary phantom sensations is not very high and lower than that of 2d moving phantom sensations. 2. the 2d positions that users perceive are systematically correlated with the target positions of 2d phantom sensations. 3. the accuracy of position perception has a bias that increases as the target position moves closer to the boundaries. 4. 2d stationary phantom sensations are not very adequate as a primary means of non-visual information delivery. 5. 2d stationary phantom sensations may still contribute to improving user experiences by providing tactile stimulation to the neighborhood of target position for the emphasis of important events. to the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first that introduces the phenomenon of 2d out-of-the-body stationary phantom sensations without a rigid medium and quantifies the perceptual performance of 2d stationary phantom sensations in terms of identification and continuous positional accuracy.",256
Understanding Artefact and Process Challenges for Designing Low-Res Lighting Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657061,"low-resolution (low-res) lighting displays are increasingly used by hci researchers, designers, and in the industry as a versatile and aesthetic medium for deploying ambient interfaces in various contexts. these display types distinguish themselves from conventional high-res screens through: high contrasts, hi-power led technology which allows visibility even in bright environments, and their ability to take on three-dimensional free forms. however, to date most work on low-res displays has been either of experimental nature or carried out in isolated industry contexts. this paper addresses this gap through an analysis of our own experiences from previous experimental design studies and related work, which led us to five domain challenges for designing low-res displays. we then describe how we approached these challenges in a deployment study, which involved the implementation of a prototype guided by a low-res prototyping toolkit. based on an analysis of our design process and findings from the deployment study, we present ten design recommendations for low-res lighting displays. as displays become more versatile and embedded into objects and environments around us, we will be consuming more and more information via low-res lighting displays. in this paper, we have shown artefact and process related domain challenges when envisioning, designing, pretesting, and deploying low-res displays. our contribution to this emerging field can therefore be summarized as: (1) a presentation of design recommendations for low-res lighting displays in the home context, and (2) how the challenges that we derived from various design studies and cases can be addressed in other design contexts by following our toolkit-supported user-centered design process. practitioners and designers can refer to these recommendations as starting points to scaffold their own process of designing low-res lighting displays.",257
Thermorph: Democratizing 4D Printing of Self-Folding Materials and Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657062,"we develop a novel method printing complex self-folding geometries. we demonstrated that with a desktop fused deposition modeling (fdm) 3d printer, off-the-shelf printing filaments and a design editor, we can print flat thermoplastic composites and trigger them to self-fold into 3d with arbitrary bending angles. this is a suitable technique, called thermorph, to prototype hollow and foldable 3d shapes without losing key features. we describe a new curved folding origami design algorithm, compiling given arbitrary 3d models to 2d unfolded models in g-code for fdm printers. to demonstrate the thermorph platform, we designed and printed complex self-folding geometries (up to 70 faces), including 15 self-curved geometric primitives and 4 self-curved applications, such as chairs, the simplified stanford bunny and flowers. compared to the standard 3d printing, our method saves up to 60% - 87% of the printing time for all shapes chosen. in this paper, we presented thermorph, a rapid prototyping system through self-folding mechanisms of shape memory thermoplastic. while self-folding has been introduced for manufacturing, the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a novel composite material design, a low cost fdm 3d printing approach, and an end-to-end design pipeline to fold a variety of arbitrary 3d geometries from a flat sheet. while our approach has proved to save printing time and post-processing efforts for a lot of complex 3d geometry fabrication comparing to standard 3d printing approach, we see the main promise of the work to achieve novel folding structures with readily available printing materials. for future work, we plan to go beyond desktop 3d printers and explore such self-folding structures on a larger scale.",258
Looks Can Be Deceiving: Using Gaze Visualisation to Predict and Mislead Opponents in Strategic Gameplay,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657063,"in competitive co-located gameplay, players use their opponents' gaze to make predictions about their plans while simultaneously managing their own gaze to avoid giving away their plans. this socially competitive dimension is lacking in most online games, where players are out of sight of each other. we conducted a lab study using a strategic online game; finding that (1) players are better at discerning their opponent's plans when shown a live visualisation of the opponent's gaze, and (2) players who are aware that their gaze is tracked will manipulate their gaze to keep their intentions hidden. we describe the strategies that players employed, to various degrees of success, to deceive their opponent through their gaze behaviour. this gaze-based deception adds an effortful and challenging aspect to the competition. lastly, we discuss the various implications of our findings and its applicability for future game design. in a lab study of an online strategy game enhanced with oneway shared gaze visualisation, we found that players were able use gaze visualisation to improve their ability to predict an opponent’s intentions. players were also able to alter their own gaze behaviour deliberately to hide their true intentions and convey false impressions, to a degree. we defined a typology of gaze-based deception strategies, which reflects the general theory of deception [5]. however, this deceptive behaviour required sustained effort, and players could not prevent some of their intentions from ‘leaking’ to the opponent through their gaze. players found this gaze-based deception task to be challenging and engaging, and we have identified several avenues that may be fruitful for game design to explore.",259
Security During Application Development: an Application Security Expert Perspective,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657064,"many of the security problems that people face today, such as security breaches and data theft, are caused by security vulnerabilities in application source code. thus, there is a need to understand and improve the experiences of those who can prevent such vulnerabilities in the first place - software developers as well as application security experts. several studies have examined developers' perceptions and behaviors regarding security vulnerabilities, demonstrating the challenges they face in performing secure programming and utilizing tools for vulnerability detection. we expand upon this work by focusing on those primarily responsible for application security - security auditors. in an interview study of 32 application security experts, we examine their views on application security processes, their workflows, and their interactions with developers in order to further inform the design of tools and processes to improve application security. to our knowledge, this paper is the first user study to specifically focus on application security experts. our results provide further evidence that application security work is primarily performed by these experts, separately from software development teams. separating security from development adds communication overhead and barriers. and finding and fixing security vulnerabilities so late in the software lifecycle can result in costly delays and expense to applications, and an increased likelihood that applications are not adequately secure. in particular, our results highlight the importance of triage to reflect risk assessments, the challenges of security communication that mostly occurs within bug tracking systems, the experts’ role of motivating developers to fix problems, the importance of security champions, and the desires for less configuration and more automation. these results further demonstrate that improving application security will involve a combination of organizational processes to incentivize and support developers in focusing on security issues earlier, developer training to give them more concrete and actionable knowledge and motivation, and tools for both developers and experts that reduce the manual burdens of configuration and analysis. we hope these results can inform a variety of process and tool improvements to reduce the costs of vulnerability detection and remediation, and allow application security experts to focus on deeper and more complex security issues and processes.",260
Insert Needle Here! A Custom Display for Optimized Biopsy Needle Placement,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657075,"needle-guiding templates are used for a variety of minimally invasive medical interventions. while physically supporting needle placement with a grid of holes, they lack integrated information where needles need to be inserted. physicians must manually determine the correct holes based on the output of planning software - a workflow that is error-prone and lengthy. we address these issues by embedding a display into the template using electroluminescence (el) screen printing. the el display is connected to planning software and illuminates the correct hole. in an empirical evaluation with physicians and researchers from the medical domain, we compare the illuminated against the conventional template as used in magnetic resonance imaging (mri) guided prostate biopsies. our results show that the el display significantly improves task completion time by 51%, task load by 47% and usability by 30%. in the presented research, we developed a customized screenprinted electroluminescense display that can be used in the extreme environment of a strong magnetic field in the mri of up to 3.0 tesla. with this, we applied customized screenprinted el displays to the medical field and improved the needle-guiding template used in prostate biopsies with integrated visual feedback. in a comparative evaluation we showed that task completion time was reduced by 51 %, task load lowered by 47 % and usability improved by 30 % when using our novel el display approach without changes to the workflow. the participants, physicians and researchers from the medical domain, highly appreciated using the illuminated display. future work will address more advanced hardware prototypes with thinner, tighter and brighter light emitting lines to further improve the needle guiding. additionally, we aim at embedding the display technology completely into the acrylic block, close to the top surface, in order to reduce the light diffusion within the template. in future studies, we are going to investigate increasing the hole density, which is currently restricted to 5 mm spacing in the manual approach. furthermore, we plan to improve the sterilizability and electronic safety of the device for clinical evaluation under an irb5 -approved study. since the device does not have any actuated components, obtaining an investigational device exemption (ide) would be straightforward, compared to robotic systems for needle guidance. with embedded visual needle-guiding, the procedure of placing the needle in the correct hole could potentially be faster and easier for all procedures involving needle-guiding templates like tissue sampling and cancer treatment without changes to the current clinical workflow.",261
Automatic Diagnosis of Students' Misconceptions in K-8 Mathematics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657076,"k-8 mathematics students must learn many procedures, such as addition and subtraction. students frequently learn ""buggy' variations of these procedures, which we ideally could identify automatically. this is challenging because there are many possible variations that reflect deep compositions of procedural thought. existing approaches for k-8 math use manually specified variations which do not scale to new math algorithms or previously unseen misconceptions. our system examines students' answers and infers how they incorrectly combine basic skills into complex procedures. we evaluate this approach on data from approximately 300 students. our system replicates 86% of the answers that contain clear systematic mistakes (13%). investigating further, we found 77% at least partially replicate a known misconception, with 53% matching exactly. we also present data from 29 participants showing that our system can demonstrate inferred incorrect procedures to an educator as successfully as a human expert. we presented a system that automatically identifies incorrect procedural thought processes in k-8 mathematics. our approach generates programs representing students’ thought processes and explains misconceptions by visualizing those programs side-by-side with the correct algorithm. the evaluations in this paper focus on k-8 mathematics, but in future work we hope to evaluate whether our approach can generalize to other domains. we believe our mechanisms for thought-process reconstruction and visualization could work for math topics that involve deterministic step-by-step computations on a 2d spreadsheet. for example, if we were to add operators that transform variables and coefficients we could potentially extend our approach to solve linear equations. in future work, we will explore how our system can be used in classroom settings by integrating it into an online grading port.",262
Defining and Predicting the Localness of Volunteered Geographic Information using Ground Truth Data,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657077,"many applications of geotagged content are predicated on the concept of localness (e.g., local restaurant recommendation, mining social media for local perspectives on an issue). however, definitions of who is a ""local"" in a given area are typically informal and ad-hoc and, as a result, approaches for localness assessment that have been used in the past have not been formally validated. in this paper, we begin the process of addressing these gaps in the literature. specifically, we (1) formalize definitions of ""local"" using themes identified in a 30-paper literature review, (2) develop the first ground truth localness dataset consisting of 132 twitter users and 58,945 place-tagged tweets, and (3) use this dataset to evaluate existing localness assessment approaches. our results provide important methodological guidance to the large body of research and practice that depends on the concept of localness and suggest means by which localness assessment can be improved. in this paper, we worked to make more concrete the idea of “localness” as it is used in computing. we formalize three definitions of localness and assess the accuracy of localness assessment techniques that have been employed in the literature according to these definitions. we find that while some techniques are relatively accurate, others are very noisy, especially for certain definitions. researchers and practitioners can utilize our results to provide methodological guidance when building applications or doing studies for which the concept of localness is important.",263
Bots & (Main)Frames: Exploring the Impact of Tangible Blocks and Collaborative Play in an Educational Programming Game,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657078,"while recent work has begun to evaluate the efficacy of educational programming games, many common design decisions in these games (e.g., single player gameplay using touchpad or mouse) have not been explored for learning outcomes. for instance, alternative design approaches such as collaborative play and embodied interaction with tangibles may also provide important benefits to learners. to better understand how these design decisions impact learning and related factors, we created an educational programming game that allows for systematically varying input method and mode of play. in this paper, we describe design rationale for mouse and tangible versions of our game, and report a 2x2 factorial experiment comparing efficacy of mouse and tangible input methods with individual and collaborative modes of play. results indicate tangibles have a greater positive impact on learning, situational interest, enjoyment, and programming self-beliefs. we also found collaborative play helps further reduce programming anxiety over individual play. in this paper, we presented a study that systematically explored how modulating input methods and mode of play in an educational programming game can impact learning outcomes and important related factors. our results provide concrete evidence that incorporating tangibles into the design of an educational programming game can improve programming self-beliefs (i.e., debugging self-efficacy, programming self-concept, programming interest, programming aptitude), situational interest (i.e., exploration intention, instant enjoyment, attention demand, novelty), subjective feelings towards enjoyment, and intentions to replay/recommend the game in the future. they also provide evidence that, while not as effective in other aspects, collaborative play does reduce players’ anxiety towards the act of programming. ultimately, we have only just begun to touch upon the impact of tangibles and collaborative play in educational programming games. one notable aspect of our study was the university age group of participants. however, many of the current cs education initiatives—such as hour of code [91]—are geared towards the k-12 demographic [5]. in future work, we plan to test our tangible and collaborative designs on younger audiences who may benefit more strongly from such approaches.",264
StammerApp: Designing a Mobile Application to Support Self-Reflection and Goal Setting for People Who Stammer,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657079,"stammering is a speech disorder affecting approximately 1% of the worldwide population. it can have associated impacts on daily life, such as loss of confidence in social situations and increased anxiety levels (particularly when speaking to strangers). work exploring the development of digital tools to support people who stammer (pws) is emerging. however, there is a paucity of research engaging pws in the design process, with participation being facilitated mainly in testing phases. in this paper, we describe the user-centered design, development and evaluation of stammerapp, a mobile application to support pws. we contribute insights into the challenges and barriers that pws experience day-to-day and reflect on the complexities of designing with this diverse group. finally, we present a set of design recommendations for the development of tools to support pws in their everyday interactions, and provide an example of how these might be envisioned through the stammerapp prototype. through this study we have offered a deepened understanding of the specific needs and values of people who stammer for the development of digital tools to support them in their day to day lives. our study has highlighted the homogeneity of stammering as a condition and the need for personalizable tools that support individuals within the settings and situations that they require most. future research is required to further scope the potential for tools such as stammerapp to make a difference in the lives of pws. while showing promise in the support of pws, larger field trials of stammerapp, over longer periods of time and with a wider sample of the stammering community, is required. whilst outside of the scope of this paper, future evaluations to determine the effectiveness of apps like stammerapp should consider the use of informal attitudinal rating scales (e.g. such as the overall assessment of the speaker’s experience of stuttering [43], or the situational anxiety hierarchy [12]), as well as considering methods such as experience sampling, to understand day to day improvements that users might be experiencing. the collection of telemetry around app use would also add depth to future trials.",265
Contextualizing Privacy Decisions for Better Prediction (and Protection),https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657070,"modern mobile operating systems implement an ask-on-first-use policy to regulate applications' access to private user data: the user is prompted to allow or deny access to a sensitive resource the first time an app attempts to use it. prior research shows that this model may not adequately capture user privacy preferences because subsequent requests may occur under varying contexts. to address this shortcoming, we implemented a novel privacy management system in android, in which we use contextual signals to build a classifier that predicts user privacy preferences under various scenarios. we performed a 37-person field study to evaluate this new permission model under normal device usage. from our exit interviews and collection of over 5 million data points from participants, we show that this new permission model reduces the error rate by 75% (i.e., fewer privacy violations), while preserving usability. we offer guidelines for how platforms can better support user privacy decision making. this study showed how apps and users respond to a real-world deployment of a novel contextually-aware permission model. the new permission system significantly reduced the error rate from that of the prevailing “ask-on-first-use” model first deployed in android 6.0. while prior work already demonstrated ways to increase the protection provided by new permission models, we believe our study provides opportunities to further improve performance and address practical limitations in actual implementations.",266
OptiSpace: Automated Placement of Interactive 3D Projection Mapping Content,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657071,"we present optispace, a system for the automated placement of perspectively corrected projection mapping content. we analyze the geometry of physical surfaces and the viewing behavior of users over time using depth cameras. our system measures user view behavior and simulates a virtual projection mapping scene users would see if content were placed in a particular way. optispace evaluates the simulated scene according to perceptual criteria, including visibility and visual quality of virtual content. finally, based on these evaluations, it optimizes content placement, using a two-phase procedure involving adaptive sampling and the covariance matrix adaptation algorithm. with our proposed architecture, projection mapping applications are developed without any knowledge of the physical layouts of the target environments. applications can be deployed in different uncontrolled environments, such as living rooms and office spaces. we have presented optispace, a system for optimizing the placement of interactive projection mapping content, based on empirical user behavior. developers implement interactive projection mapping applications just once, without knowledge of the actual room geometry or possible user viewing angles. applications can then be deployed in different uncontrolled environments, not necessarily by the developers themselves. optispace automatically measures the target environment, including users, who are completely uninstrumented. our optimization is based on our measurements and various programmable attributes and behaviors. we have proposed an approach to estimating the quality of perspectively corrected content. the generic design of our architecture makes it applicable to a broad range of dynamic interactive projection mapping applications for uncontrolled environments.",267
Technology and the Givens of Existence: Toward an Existential Inquiry Framework in HCI Research,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657072,"the profound impact of digital technologies on human life makes it imperative for hci research to deal with the most fundamental aspects of human existence. arguably, insights from existential philosophy and psychology are highly relevant for addressing such issues. building on previous attempts to bring in existential themes and terminology to hci, this paper argues that yalom's notion of ""the givens of existence"", as well as related work in experimental existential psychology, can inform the development of an existential inquiry framework in hci. the envisioned framework is intended to complement current approaches in hci by specifically focusing on the existential aspects of the design and use of technology. the paper reflects on possible ways, in which existential concepts can support hci research, and maintains that adopting an existential framework in hci would be consistent with the overall conceptual development of the field. psychology played a central role in the emergence of hci, which is directly obvious even from the titles of the books that, essentially, created the field: the psychology of human computer interaction [19] and designing interaction: psychology at the human-computer interface [20]. the books offered the vision of hci as a field at the intersection of computer science and social sciences (most notably, psychology), in which social sciences were expected to inform the design of better systems. as these field-shaping books indicate, in its early years, the field of hci was generally understood as a problem-solver, not a problem owner. things are different now. to begin with, the impact of psychology on hci is not as visible as it used to be. more importantly, hci is no longer only about helping system developers create useful and usable technologies; it is gradually transforming itself into a field with its own agenda, a field, which is not only a problem solver but also seeks to define itself as a problem owner. this transition does not occur smoothly; despite abundant visible signs of being a booming, highly successful area, hci appears to be experiencing some sort of an identity crisis [38]. while it is clear that the field is not just about exploring novel design solutions for better digital products, it is less clear what hci’s own research agenda is. a key direction in which the field explores a possibility to define its own object of inquiry, is, as discussed above, becoming more focused on people, on the impact of technology on how humans make meaning of their lives [3,46]. this object of inquiry is, in a way, opposite to hci’s initial concern: it implies prioritizing the implications of technology for people, rather than the implications of studying people for the design of technology [22]. one of the main challenges for the transition to a new agenda is a lack of sufficiently developed methods, approaches, and terminology that could be used to more specifically analyze the actual meaning making processes studied in hci. a number of concepts and methods in the field provide a general conceptual framing for the analysis; for instance, they identify the underlying foundations (e.g., embodiment [21]) or strategies (e.g., design provocations [23,24]) of meaning making. however, there has been relatively little attention to systematic conceptual analysis of meaning making per se. a possible way of dealing with this challenge, discussed in this paper, is turning back to psychology, a discipline that once contributed to the very emergence of hci. however, the versions of psychology, explored in the paper— existential psychotherapy and experimental existential psychology—are quite different from the information processing psychology of the 1980s. instead of suggesting models of human cognition, they offer insights into how people deal with the most fundamental challenges of their existence. two issues need to be clarified in relation to the claims made in this paper. first, it is not the intention of this paper to undermine the importance of hci research directed at the design of better digital technologies. hci studies that primarily aim to contribute to design, either by identifying the need for new technologies or creating and testing novel design solutions are, and will always be, a crucial part of hci. in addition, the adoption of more human-centered approaches in hci does not exclude potential design contributions. on the contrary, it may actually open new opportunities for the field to make an impact on the development of new technologies. second, the suggestion to expand the scope of hci to include existential issues, outlined in this paper, could be perceived as an attempt to go too far in extending the scope of the field. since hci cannot be about everything, perhaps existential issues should be left to other disciplines that have a longer experience of engaging with them? the position adopted in this paper is that, while it is true that blurring the borders of hci can be a problem, a certain overlap between hci and existing fields is inevitable and probably even desirable. hci has a valuable and unique experience of conducting research into how digital technologies transform our lives, an experience that other disciplines are lacking. therefore, it is unlikely that analysis of the impact of digital technologies on human experience of existential issues can be completely delegated to other fields. on a final note, it would be a mistake to label the existential perspective as a basically pessimistic view that only emphasizes the tragic, dark side of our existence. while the perspective does point to enormous existential challenges, it also emphasizes how precious each moment of our life is and suggests that directly facing the “givens of existence” may help us understand how to make our lives more authentic and meaningful. one can argue that it is unrealistic to expect hci research to contribute to fulfilling this ideal in a concrete and specific way, and it may be true. or maybe not.",268
Smart Kitchens for People with Cognitive Impairments: A Qualitative Study of Design Requirements,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657073,"individuals with cognitive impairments currently leverage extensive human resources during their transitions from assisted living to independent living. in western europe, many government-supported volunteer organizations provide sheltered living facilities; supervised environments in which people with cognitive impairments collaboratively learn daily living skills. in this paper, we describe communal cooking practices in sheltered living facilities and identify opportunities for supporting these with interactive technology to reduce volunteer workload. we conducted two contextual observations of twelve people with cognitive impairments cooking in sheltered living facilities and supplemented this data through interviews with four employees and volunteers who supervise them. through thematic analysis, we identified four themes to inform design requirements for communal cooking activities: work organization, community, supervision, and practicalities. based on these, we present five design implications for assistive systems in kitchens for people with cognitive deficiencies. in this paper, we investigated the design space of smart kitchens for cognitively impaired persons living in sheltered housing facilities. within qualitative contextual inquiries, we obtained data by observing the target group during cooking. furthermore, interviews were conducted to explore design gaps in-depth. by analyzing the interviews, we derived the four relevant themes work organization, community, supervision, and practicalities, which emerge as important factors. we conclude with five design implications, which should be considered when designing smart kitchens for cognitively impaired persons: clear communication of tasks, fostering the group experience, prioritizing safety, providing rewards, and enabling contextual adaptivity.",269
Graphical Perception of Continuous Quantitative Maps: the Effects of Spatial Frequency and Colormap Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657074,"continuous 'pseudocolor' maps visualize how a quantitative attribute varies smoothly over space. these maps are widely used by experts and lay citizens alike for communicating scientific and geographical data. a critical challenge for designers of these maps is selecting a color scheme that is both effective and aesthetically pleasing. although there exist empirically grounded guidelines for color choice in segmented maps (e.g., choropleths), continuous maps are significantly understudies, and their color-coding guidelines are largely based on expert opinion and design heuristics--many of these guidelines have yet to be verified experimentally. we conducted a series of crowdsourced experiments to investigate how the perception of continuous maps is affected by colormap characteristics and spatial frequency (a measure of data complexity). we find that spatial frequency significantly impacts the effectiveness of color encodes, but the precise effect is task-dependent. while rainbow schemes afforded the highest accuracy in quantity estimation irrespective of spatial complexity, divergent colormaps significantly outperformed other schemes in tasks requiring the perception of high-frequency patterns. we interpret these results in relation to current practices, and devise new and more granular guidelines for color mapping in continuous maps. we conducted three experiments to investigate the effects of spatial frequency and colormap characteristics on the perception of continuous, pseudocolor maps. our results indicate that spatial frequency impacts judgment of the encoded quantities and structures. while viewers’ quantity estimation accuracy exhibited a predictable response, increased data complexity had a more nuanced effect on gradient and pattern comprehension, the impact of which was dependent on the colormap used. designers should therefore consider both the type of task and the spatial complexity of the underlying data. we re-examined current guidelines and devised new recommendations for color-coding of continuous spatial data.",270
Wall++: Room-Scale Interactive and Context-Aware Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657085,"human environments are typified by walls, homes, offices, schools, museums, hospitals and pretty much every indoor context one can imagine has walls. in many cases, they make up a majority of readily accessible indoor surface area, and yet they are static their primary function is to be a wall, separating spaces and hiding infrastructure. we present wall++, a low-cost sensing approach that allows walls to become a smart infrastructure. instead of merely separating spaces, walls can now enhance rooms with sensing and interactivity. our wall treatment and sensing hardware can track users' touch and gestures, as well as estimate body pose if they are close. by capturing airborne electromagnetic noise, we can also detect what appliances are active and where they are located. through a series of evaluations, we demonstrate wall++ can enable robust room-scale interactive and context-aware applications. in this work, we introduced wall++, a low-cost sensing technique that can turn ordinary walls into smart infrastructure, able to sense interactions and activities happening in a room, and potentially throughout an entire building. our multi-phase exploration of materials, application methods, and electrode patterns informed our proof-of-concept hardware and software implementation. then, through a series of user studies, we demonstrated that wall++ can robustly track user touches and poses, as well as detect and track appliances (or tagged users) in a room.",271
Design Vocabulary for Human--IoT Systems Communication,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657086,"digital devices and intelligent systems are becoming popular and ubiquitous all around us. however, they seldom provide sufficient feed-forwards and feedbacks to reassure users as to their current status and indicate what actions they are about to perform. in this study, we selected and analyzed nine concept videos on future iot products/systems. through systematic analysis of the interactions and communications of users with the machines and systems demonstrated in the films, we extracted 38 design vocabulary items and clustered them into 12 groups: active, request, trigger functions, approve, reject, notify, recommend, guide, show problems, express emotions, exchange info, and socialize. this framework can not only inspire designers to create self-explanatory intelligence, but also support developers to provide a language structure at different levels of the periphery of human attention. through the enhancement of situated awareness, human iot system interaction can become more seamless and graceful. as we surround ourselves with more and more smart objects, feedback is probably even more essential when we interact with those objects than with other people. we need to know what is happening, what the machine has detected, what its status is, and what actions it is about to perform [32]. to understand the various kinds of possible situation that the user wants to know about or the machine wants to communicate, we selected and analyzed nine concept videos on human–system interactions. from these we extracted a vocabulary of 38 design terms clustered in 12 groups. the findings do not simply cover the feedback design of available systems, but express possibilities for designing future objects with sociability. with this framework, developers would be able to build a language structure to convey the artefact’s intended purpose to the user, while at the same time it could also establish the rational accountability for increasing human users’ situated awareness. in this way, human users could effortlessly anticipate the status of iot systems from implicit or peripheral communications and switch their attention to have focused interactions when needed. this human-like communication could make the interaction experience more graceful and enjoyable.",272
"Accountability Work: Examining the Values, Technologies and Work Practices that Facilitate Transparency in Charities",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657087,"charities are subject to stringent transparency and accountability requirements from government and funders to ensure that they are conducting work and spending money appropriately. charities are increasingly important to civic life and have unique characteristics as organisations. this provides a rich space in which hci research may learn from and affect both held notions of transparency and accountability, and the relationships between these organisations and their stakeholders. we conducted ethnographic fieldwork and workshops over a seven month period at a charity. we aimed to understand how the transparency obligations of a charity manifest through work and how the workers of a charity reason about transparency and accountability as an everyday practice. our findings highlight how organisations engage in presenting different accounts of their work; how workers view their legal transparency obligations in contrast with their accountability to their everyday community; and how their labour does not translate well to outcome measures or metrics. we discuss implications for the design of future systems that support organisations to produce accounts of their work as part of everyday practice.support organisations to produce accounts of their work as part of everyday practice. in this paper we set out to explore how an understanding of the everyday work practices of charities could be used to inform the design of systems that seek to support them in becoming transparent and accountable. we explicate that the complex nature of transparency and accountability manifests as a variety of interconnected work practices that are experienced by the charity workers, and how socio-technical systems that are used by organisations also affect these same practices. we then present implications for the design of future systems that embed values of worker control and flexibility in order to support charities navigating their obligations in everyday practice. we discuss this by drawing upon our understanding of the accountable nature of work practices, and how this may be captured and represented through interoperable digital systems that allow charities to configure transparency and accountability in accordance with their needs; leading to the concept of ‘linked accounting’. charity organisations and the hci community share important civic and social concerns, and the reduction of barriers to a charity’s efforts through digital technologies has far-reaching implications for society. future work should seek to further engage with charities to collaboratively develop and deploy these systems to discover how they may be appropriated into work practice to achieve organisational goals. care should be taken to ensure that these novel accounting technologies are developed so that they are not used to control the actions of workers, but used to provide the workers a flexible means to deliver work, and to have this interpreted in a diverse number of ways. in doing so hci may affect civic change through engagement with this rich design space.",273
Crowdsourcing Treatments for Low Back Pain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657088,"low back pain (lbp) is a globally common condition with no silver bullet solutions. further, the lack of therapeutic consensus causes challenges in choosing suitable solutions to try. in this work, we crowdsourced knowledge bases on lbp treatments. the knowledge bases were used to rank and offer best-matching lbp treatments to end users. we collected two knowledge bases: one from clinical professionals and one from non-professionals. our quantitative analysis revealed that non-professional end users perceived the best treatments by both groups as equally good. however, the worst treatments by non-professionals were clearly seen as inferior to the lowest ranking treatments by professionals. certain treatments by professionals were also perceived significantly differently by non-professionals and professionals themselves. professionals found our system handy for self-reflection and for educating new patients, while non-professionals appreciated the reliable decision support that also respected the non-professional opinion. back pain workshop is a crowd-powered online system that lets users discover lbp treatments that originate from two distinct crowds: professionals and non-professionals. our results indicated that, according to non-professionals’ assessment, the highest-rated treatments crowdsourced from non-professionals are of comparable quality to the highestrated treatments from professionals. however, in their assessment, the worst treatments from non-professionals were perceived clearly as worse than the worst from nonprofessionals. professionals, on the other hand, perceived many of their own suggestions to be of lower quality than what non-professionals think of the same treatments. clinical professionals are, thus, more critical of the presented “gold-standard” solutions. back pain workshop is not only about data: it was seen as a reliable information source that contributed especially by bundling the non-professional opinion in the same tool that offers professional advice. the clinical professionals found value in self-reflection, because the general public disagreed with their assessment of certain treatments. they also found potential in the tool in clinical use with new patients with no extensive experience with back pain. we contribute to crowdsourcing literature with a real-world case study that built diverse, reusable knowledge bases on a relevant and burdensome global issue: low back pain. in the future, we shall focus on improving this particular deployment and experimenting with other medical conditions.",274
Emotional Dialogue Generation using Image-Grounded Language Models,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657089,"computer-based conversational agents are becoming ubiquitous. however, for these systems to be engaging and valuable to the user, they must be able to express emotion, in addition to providing informative responses. humans rely on much more than language during conversations; visual information is key to providing context. we present the first example of an image-grounded conversational agent using visual sentiment, facial expression and scene features. we show that key qualities of the generated dialogue can be manipulated by the features used for training the agent. we evaluate our model on a large and very challenging real-world dataset of conversations from social media (twitter). the image-grounding leads to significantly more informative, emotional and specific responses, and the exact qualities can be tuned depending on the image features used. furthermore, our model improves the objective quality of dialogue responses when evaluated on standard natural language metrics. we present the first example of an image-grounded conversational agent using visual sentiment, facial expression and scene features. we trained a novel ca on a large dataset of highly naturalistic conversations from twitter. this model allowed for in-depth analyses of the relationships between such image information and the generated language. specifically, we analyzed and discussed the influence that image sentiment and image content have on the sentiment and content in the responses to the visually aided questions. evaluation on an independent set of conversations showed that including image features increased how emotional, informative and relevant the generated dialogue was judged to be. we also found that visual sentiment and facial features in the images were the primary drivers of variations in sentiment in the generated responses. in addition, scene (content) features had more influence on the topic that was generated in the output. our proposed model also significantly outperformed the baseline on automated linguistic metrics. grounding conversations using images is an exciting new research domain that could contribute to more natural and engaging ca. finally, our work can benefit social media researchers as a means to discover novel insights in multimedia posts that combine imagery and dialogue.",275
"Science Everywhere: Designing Public, Tangible Displays to Connect Youth Learning Across Settings",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657080,"a major challenge in education is understanding how to connect learning experiences across settings (e.g., school, afterschool, and home) for youth. in this paper, we introduce and describe the participatory design process we undertook to develop science everywhere (se), which is a sociotechnical system where children share their everyday science learning via social media. public displays installed throughout the neighborhood invite parents, adults, peers, and community members to interact with children's ideas to better develop connections for learning across settings. our case study of community interactions with the public displays illuminate how these technologies encouraged behaviors such as the noticing of children's ideas, recognition of people in the neighborhood, and bridging to new learning opportunities for youth. this study contributes deeper insights around recent movements to design and study “smart and connected learning communities” (sclc) [44]. the overarching vision of sclc’s is to leverage technology (mobile, sensing, big data tools etc.) to help facilitate learning across settings, build from community needs, and “smartly” coordinate human and social capital to support learning. one might imagine a future world in which learners can find relevant learning opportunities on the fly as they move about their neighborhoods or cities. individuals may engage in projects that are deeply meaningful to them and have impact on their local community. they may also be recognized for these activities as markers of learning. finally, learners could – in this far future vision – find help and social support more efficiently and equitably to further spur their learning forward. how do we design to realize this far-term vision? our current study explores a few design conjectures and illuminates some future needs. we show how technologies that deepen awareness of a neighborhood and its rich assets is a fundamental need, and our findings support past research, such as carroll and rosson’s work on community technologies to build connectedness [13]. we build from erete’s framework of community technologies [23] and show that se was well designed for social cohesion (helping people recognize each other and assets), small group interaction (within a classroom, church, or afterschool program), and interest-based groups (promoting science awareness in the neighborhood). however, we found that another major challenge is the promotion of social capital or translating this cohesion, interaction, and interest into action that can bring more resources to support children’s learning. overall our study offers design and qualitative accounts that may be translatable for future sclc projects. designers can build from the design decisions we made, and the prior hci literature on creating public displays and social media [2, 4, 31], to coordinate the sharing of learning in communities. decisions about technology, interaction design, and the issues of designing for community practices, privacy needs, and the unique contexts of children and families will be important to realize any future initiative. furthermore, we hope that our documentation of how we embedded se technologies in partnership with neighborhoods, can provide templates to build upon for future community-facing, design research around sclcs [28]. our findings point to the complex challenge of coordinating factors such as awareness, social connection, institutions, learning practices, and social capital to realize the full potential of smart and connected learning communities of the future, that provide equitable and innovative learning ecosystems for learners everywhere.",276

Understanding Face and Eye Visibility in Front-Facing Cameras of Smartphones used in the Wild,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657082,"commodity mobile devices are now equipped with high-resolution front-facing cameras, allowing applications in biometrics (e.g., faceid in the iphone x), facial expression analysis, or gaze interaction. however, it is unknown how often users hold devices in a way that allows capturing their face or eyes, and how this impacts detection accuracy. we collected 25,726 in-the-wild photos, taken from the front-facing camera of smartphones as well as associated application usage logs. we found that the full face is visible about 29% of the time, and that in most cases the face is only partially visible. furthermore, we identified an influence of users' current activity; for example, when watching videos, the eyes but not the entire face are visible 75% of the time in our dataset. we found that a state-of-the-art face detection algorithm performs poorly against photos taken from front-facing cameras. we discuss how these findings impact mobile applications that leverage face and eye detection, and derive practical implications to address state-of-the art's limitations. in this work we collected a dataset of 25,726 photos taken from front-facing cameras of smartphone in the wild and analysed it with respect to face and eye visibility. we are happy to share the dataset for the community to build over our work; please contact the first author for a link to the dataset. being the first dataset of its kind, we gained several insights. most importantly, we showed that the user’s face and eyes are not always visible in the front-facing camera view, and not always detectable by state-of-the-art face detection methods. we found that the currently running application, the hand used to carry the phone, and the state of the user influenced the visibility of the user’s eyes and face. there are many cases where the user’s eyes, but not the whole face, were visible. we discussed how the results motivate the need for new computer vision algorithms that rely on the eyes only and not necessarily on the visibility of the full face. we also discussed how applications could guide the user to revealing her face to the front-facing camera, directions for exploiting the dataset and the results of this study, privacy implications, and challenges of this type of research.",278
Perspective on and Re-orientation of Physical Proxies in Object-Focused Remote Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657083,"remote collaborators working together on physical objects have difficulty building a shared understanding of what each person is talking about. conventional video chat systems are insufficient for many situations because they present a single view of the object in a flattened image. to understand how this limited perspective affects collaboration, we designed the remote manipulator (rema), which can reproduce orientation manipulations on a proxy object at a remote site. we conducted two studies with rema, with two main findings. first, a shared perspective is more effective and preferred compared to the opposing perspective offered by conventional video chat systems. second, the physical proxy and video chat complement one another in a combined system: people used the physical proxy to understand objects, and used video chat to perform gestures and confirm remote actions. this paper explores the challenges of coordinating objectfocused collaboration when collaborators are remote from one another. specifically, we considered how collaborators’ perspectives on an object affects the way in which they coordinate activity. we built and studied the remote manipulator (rema), which automatically orients the proxy object to reflect the orientation at a tracking site. we found that a shared perspective on the object is easier for people to manage compared to the default “opposing” perspective offered by conventional video chat. we also found that rema can be a useful aid to collaboration, easing the pressure of describing and reproducing verbal reorientation cues on an object. finally, our analysis shows that rema and a video channel complement each other when used together, giving people more effective tools to coordinate their actions in object-focused collaboration. looking forward, our results suggest ways that researchers should consider new workspaces that improve object-focused collaboration, including supporting simultaneous object manipulation and remote gesture, managing synchronized and unsynchronized object manipulation, and handling bidirectional capture and manipulation.",279
The Index of Pupillary Activity: Measuring Cognitive Load vis-à-vis Task Difficulty with Pupil Oscillation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657084,"a novel eye-tracked measure of the frequency of pupil diameter oscillation is proposed for capturing what is thought to be an indicator of cognitive load. the proposed metric, termed the index of pupillary activity, is shown to discriminate task difficulty vis-a-vis cognitive load (if the implied causality can be assumed) in an experiment where participants performed easy and difficult mental arithmetic tasks while fixating a central target (a requirement for replication of prior work). the paper's contribution is twofold: full documentation is provided for the calculation of the proposed measurement which can be considered as an alternative to the existing proprietary index of cognitive activity (ica). thus, it is possible for researchers to replicate the experiment and build their own software which implements this measurement. second, several aspects of the ica are approached in a more data-sensitive way with the goal of improving the measurement's performance. being able to distinguish a user’s level of cognitive load has significant implications for design and/or evaluation of interactive systems. measurement of cognitive load could allow a system to respond appropriately, modulating the level of task difficulty (e.g., as in e-learning systems [57]), or by adapting mission-critical systems to the user’s cognitive state [60]. we reviewed cognitive load theory and its connection to task-evoked eye movement measures, namely pupillary responses. we gave a novel method of estimating frequency of pupil oscillation termed the index of pupillary activity. we have discussed the limitations of pupillometric measures and suggested measurement of pupil oscillation as an alternative for estimating task difficulty vis-à-vis cognitive load.",280
Voicesetting: Voice Authoring UIs for Improved Expressivity in Augmentative Communication,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657095,"alternative and augmentative communication (aac) systems used by people with speech disabilities rely on text-to-speech (tts) engines for synthesizing speech. advances in tts systems allowing for the rendering of speech with a range of emotions have yet to be incorporated into aac systems, leaving aac users with speech that is mostly devoid of emotion and expressivity. in this work, we describe voicesetting as the process of authoring the speech properties of text. we present the design and evaluation of two voicesetting user interfaces: the expressive keyboard, designed for rapid addition of expressivity to speech, and the voicesetting editor, designed for more careful crafting of the way text should be spoken. we evaluated the perceived output quality, requisite effort, and usability of both interfaces; the concept of voicesetting and our interfaces were highly valued by end-users as an enhancement to communication quality. we close by discussing design insights from our evaluations. in this paper, we introduced the concept of voicesetting interfaces for allowing aac users to explicitly control the expressive properties of synthetic speech. we contributed two novel designs for voicesetting interfaces that offer different effort/quality tradeoffs. the expressive keyboard treats emoji and punctuation as expressive operators over the surrounding speech, adding vocal sound effects, changing the tone of voice, and altering prosodic features such as the pitch of the voice. the active listening mode of the expressive keyboard allows users to rapidly express reactions (i.e., vocal sound effects like laughter) while listening to others speak. the voicesetting editor provides users with the ability to carefully craft the way their text should be spoken. these designs were evaluated through an online questionnaire to evaluate the perceived quality of speech authored with these interfaces, and through in-lab qualitative and semi-structured feedback sessions with people with als.",281
Digital Outdoor Play: Benefits and Risks from an Interaction Design Perspective,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657096,"outdoor play has been proven to be beneficial for children's development. hci research on heads-up games suggests that the well-known decline in outdoor play can be addressed by adding technology to such activities. however, outdoor play benefits such as social interaction, creative thinking, and physical activity may be compromised when digital features are added. we present the design & implementation of a novel digitally-enhanced outdoor-play prototype. our evaluation with 48 children revealed that a non-digital version of the novel outdoor play object afforded social play and game invention. evaluation of the digitally-enhanced version showed reduced collaborative social interaction and reduced creative thinking when compared with baseline. however, we showed that specific sensing and feedback features better supported outdoor play benefits. for example non-accumulated feedback was shown to increase collaborative play and creative thinking in comparison to accumulated feedback. we provide evidence-based recommendations for designers of outdoor play technologies. this paper presents evidence-based recommendations for designers of outdoor play devices based on design, implementation and evaluation of a digitally enhanced outdoor play object. our findings revealed the fragility of outdoor play benefits when digital features are added. we showed that different types of sensing and feedback have different impact on outdoor play. for example, accumulated feedback strengthened competitive play while and non-accumulated feedback promoted collaborative play and creative thinking. our study clearly shows that designers should carefully evaluate the implications of integrating sensing and feedback to outdoor play, to make sure their devices do not compromise outdoor play benefits.",282
Leveraging Community-Generated Videos and Command Logs to Classify and Recommend Software Workflows,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657097,"users of complex software applications often rely on inefficient or suboptimal workflows because they are not aware that better methods exist. in this paper, we develop and validate a hierarchical approach combining topic modeling and frequent pattern mining to classify the workflows offered by an application, based on a corpus of community-generated videos and command logs. we then propose and evaluate a design space of four different workflow recommender algorithms, which can be used to recommend new workflows and their associated videos to software users. an expert validation of the task classification approach found that 82% of the time, experts agreed with the classifications. we also evaluate our workflow recommender algorithms, demonstrating their potential and suggesting avenues for future work. in this paper, we have proposed a hierarchical approach to classifying user workflows by first applying topic modeling to identify high-level tasks, and then applying frequent pattern mining to identify distinct command patterns for each task. an evaluation showed encouraging evidence that topic modeling can effectively categorize logs into meaningful high-level tasks. as well, the hierarchical approach appears to help identify a larger variety of distinct command patterns. based on this approach, we proposed a design space of workflow-based recommender systems. an evaluation of four such algorithms was encouraging, and suggests that this approach has the potential to effectively support software users.",283
Towards Algorithmic Experience: Initial Efforts for Social Media Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657098,"algorithms influence most of our daily activities, decisions, and they guide our behaviors. it has been argued that algorithms even have a direct impact on democratic societies. human - computer interaction research needs to develop analytical tools for describing the interaction with, and experience of algorithms. based on user participatory workshops focused on scrutinizing facebook's newsfeed, an algorithm-influenced social media, we propose the concept of algorithmic experience (ax) as an analytic framing for making the interaction with and experience of algorithms explicit. connecting it to design, we articulate five functional categories of ax that are particularly important to cater for in social media: profiling transparency and management, algorithmic awareness and control, and selective algorithmic memory. this article has proposed the concept of algorithmic experience (ax) as a way to conceptualize the ways in which users experience systems and interfaces that are heavily influenced by algorithmic behavior. building on bucher [7] we can note that in current social media, ax is largely negative, as the algorithmic influence is foregrounded only when it behaves erroneously or unpredictably. hence, we suggest that ax can be deliberately designed to foreground algorithmic behavior and increase user awareness of algorithmic influence. it is important to realize that ax and the socioeconomic dynamics of facebook’s business are only partly aligned [10,27]. while there may be economic and commercial reasons behind the current algorithmic obscureness towards the user, we have here chosen to frame ax from a usercentered perspective. from a commercial perspective, ax may contribute towards a more joyful and faithful relationship with a service, avoiding the possible bad experiences [7,9]. by placing the user in focus, hci can serve to support an important debate related to the political and legal issues involved around algorithms, privacy, and users’ rights. during the workshops carried out within this project, users consistently expressed that the explicit awareness of and discussion of ax gave them conceptual tools to analyze the technologies they use and to understand how they work. participants were not previously aware of how their behavior was tracked, and the ways this influenced the facebook service. after getting familiar with the concept of algorithmic experience, participants reported that they became more aware of their use of digital platforms and also changed their way of using facebook in order to improve its service in accordance to their interests. the awareness of ax thus works as a “new lens” for users, for understanding and using digital technologies. the concept also can become useful in design. in this article, we suggest five particular ways in which the design of social media can cater for increasing algorithmic awareness and improving ax. algorithmic profiling transparency provides users ways to understand what the system knows about them and how the offered results are related to that profiling. in this it is important to display both internal profiling, the implicit profiling mechanism based on the user’s behavior within the system, and to make transparent what the system is gathering from external sources such as browser tracking or third party/allied companies’ services. algorithmic profiling management allows users to refine the profile. explicit profile management helps users correct profiling behavior, and is an important resource also for designers as it allows for implicit and explicit feedback to personalization [5:213]. algorithmic user-control could empower users to give them a level of control over their social media services. it includes turning off and on algorithmic interventions as well as tracking. selective algorithmic memory offers the user a possibility to make the system forget their previous interactions and delimit their influence over the future algorithmic results. finally, algorithmic awareness can be directly fostered through informing users about how the algorithms work and how the user’s behavior affects its behavior. in this lies a didactical challenge to present the user with sufficient information, but at the same time not expose the social media platform to user behavior that can compromise its function or commercial viability.",284
Which one is me?: Identifying Oneself on Public Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657099,"while user representations are extensively used on public displays, it remains unclear how well users can recognize their own representation among those of surrounding users. we study the most widely used representations: abstract objects, skeletons, silhouettes and mirrors. in a prestudy (n=12), we identify five strategies that users follow to recognize themselves on public displays. in a second study (n=19), we quantify the users' recognition time and accuracy with respect to each representation type. our findings suggest that there is a significant effect of (1) the representation type, (2) the strategies performed by users, and (3) the combination of both on recognition time and accuracy. we discuss the suitability of each representation for different settings and provide specific recommendations as to how user representations should be applied in multi-user scenarios. these recommendations guide practitioners and researchers in selecting the representation that optimizes the most for the deployment's requirements, and for the user strategies that are feasible in that environment. in this work, we studied how well passersby can distinguish their own representations from those of others on a large public display. we identified 5 main strategies that users employ to identify themselves in a pre-study. in a follow-up study we quantified the time and accuracy of recognizing one’s own user representation. furthermore we introduced 6 recommendations to help designers choose the suitable user representation depending on the context of their deployments.",285
Analysis and Modeling of Grid Performance on Touchscreen Mobile Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657090,"touchscreen mobile devices can afford rich interaction behaviors but they are complex to model. scrollable two-dimensional grids are a common user interface on mobile devices that allow users to access a large number of items on a small screen by direct touch. by analyzing touch input and eye gaze of users during grid interaction, we reveal how multiple performance components come into play in such a task, including navigation, visual search and pointing. these findings inspired us to design a novel predictive model that combines these components for modeling grid tasks. we realized these model components by employing both traditional analytical methods and data-driven machine learning approaches. in addition to showing high accuracy achieved by our model in predicting human performance on a test dataset, we demonstrate how such a model can lead to a significant reduction in interaction time when used in a predictive user interface. we present an investigation into scrollable two dimensional grid uis on touchscreen mobile devices. the study contributed a set of useful findings for understanding user behaviors on using a mobile grid ui. based on these findings, we devised a novel predictive model for performance time where many unique characteristics of grid uis converge into one formulation. we also discussed how such a predictive model can be used for utility-based optimization of user interfaces. the work contributes to hci research of user performance modeling, taking steps toward modeling the complex behaviors inherent in mobile user interaction.",286
Communication Behavior in Embodied Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657091,"embodied virtual reality faithfully renders users' movements onto an avatar in a virtual 3d environment, supporting nuanced nonverbal behavior alongside verbal communication. to investigate communication behavior within this medium, we had 30 dyads complete two tasks using a shared visual workspace: negotiating an apartment layout and placing model furniture on an apartment floor plan. dyads completed both tasks under three different conditions: face-to-face, embodied vr with visible full-body avatars, and no embodiment vr, where the participants shared a virtual space, but had no visible avatars. both subjective measures of users' experiences and detailed annotations of verbal and nonverbal behavior are used to understand how the media impact communication behavior. embodied vr provides a high level of social presence with conversation patterns that are very similar to face-to-face interaction. in contrast, providing only the shared environment was generally found to be lonely and appears to lead to degraded communication. embodied virtual reality and face-to-face interaction showed remarkably similar verbal and nonverbal communicative behavior, with the anticipated drop off for vr without bodies. having a tracked body in the virtual world seems to help people feel that they are really interacting with another person: all but one subjective measure showed no significant difference for social presence between f2f and embodvr, with lower social awareness possibly reflecting the lack of facial information. there was a clear preference for including a body in the experience as people felt “alone"" in no_embodvr and ratings dropped. removing the body decreased referential pronoun usage and lowered the frequency with which participants took conversational turns. there are, of course, limitations to the work. the first is that this study examined a particular context in which users have a shared visual work space. the activities included a negotiation task and a design task. behavior may vary for different environments and different activities. a second limitation is that while we measure conversational behavior and subjective experience, we don’t measure the effectiveness of the conversation. both of these issues point to interesting follow-up work. for example, it would be interesting to examine social conversation to see whether facial motion plays a more dominant role here. facial animation was excluded from this study both due to technical limitations and in order to focus on the impact of body movement. the study also used relatively lowfidelity models. it would be interesting to see if behavior and experience changes with photo-realistic models that include facial animation.",287
"In the Eye of the Student: An Intangible Cultural Heritage Experience, with a Human-Computer Interaction Twist",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657092,"we critically engage with chi communities emerging outside the global north (arabhci and africhi) to explore how participation is configured and enacted within socio-cultural and political contexts fundamentally different from western societies. we contribute to recent discussions about postcolonialism and decolonization of hci by focusing on non-western future technology designers. our lens was a course designed to engage egyptian students with a local yet culturally-distant community to design applications for documenting intangible heritage. through an action research, the instructors reflect on selected students' activities. despite deploying a flexible learning curriculum that encourages greater autonomy, the students perceived themselves with less agency than other institutional stakeholders involved in the project. further, some of them struggled to empathize with the community as the impact of the cultural differences on configuring participation was profound. we discuss the implications of the findings on hci education and in international cross-cultural design projects. in this paper, we engaged with hci movements that address overcoming colonization legacy in technology design for non-western contexts. we took an hci education lens to engage with future egyptian designers in genuine open discussions about power dynamics and cultural values to better scaffold their learning experience. our findings invite the hci community to question power and diversity in local and global contexts as it takes a broader stance to unbalances in cross-cultural design. our recommendations, we argue, would enrich the diversity discourse in hci.",288
shapeShift: 2D Spatial Manipulation and Self-Actuation of Tabletop Shape Displays for Tangible and Haptic Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657093,"we explore interactions enabled by 2d spatial manipulation and self-actuation of a tabletop shape display. to explore these interactions, we developed shapeshift, a compact, high-resolution (7 mm pitch), mobile tabletop shape display. shapeshift can be mounted on passive rollers allowing for bimanual interaction where the user can freely manipulate the system while it renders spatially relevant content. shapeshift can also be mounted on an omnidirectional-robot to provide both vertical and lateral kinesthetic feedback, display moving objects, or act as an encountered-type haptic device for vr. we present a study on haptic search tasks comparing spatial manipulation of a shape display for egocentric exploration of a map versus exploration using a fixed display and a touch pad. results show a 30% decrease in navigation path lengths, 24% decrease in task time, 15% decrease in mental demand and 29% decrease in frustration in favor of egocentric navigation. mobile shape displays combine the benefits of both actuated tangibles (dynamic uis with controllable lateral kinesthetic haptic feedback) and actuated pin arrays (general purpose shape-change). mobility allows us to leverage smaller shape displays to provide users with a large workspace while maintaining lower costs and complexity. through shapeshift, we have explored the passive and active mobility of shape displays. this type of display can be used to render and manipulate static content or to physically explore 2d situated information spaces. our user evaluation on a spatial map search task using a passively mobile shape display as navigation input shows that it helps increase search efficiency and reduce users’ cognitive load. self-actuation of tabletop shape displays enables new forms of output such as displaying objects’ 2d spatial motion and providing lateral kinesthetic feedback. combined with an hmd, the display can also be used as an encountered-type haptic device for vr applications. the added degrees of freedom of mobile tabletop shape displays offer an exciting area of opportunity to better leverage our haptic senses and spatial skills when interacting with digital information. we hope shapeshift’s open-source platform will inspire both designers and researchers in prototyping new interactive physical interfaces.",289
"Where is Community Among Online Learners?: Identity, Efficacy and Personal Ties",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657094,"research questions about community among online learners are gaining importance as enrollments in online programs explode. however, what community means for this context has not been studied in a comprehensive way. we contribute a quantitative study of learners' feelings and behavior expectations about online community, adapting scales for sense of community (soc) and developing an instrument to assess community collective efficacy (cce). our analysis of students' responses to these scales revealed two factors underlying soc (shared identity and interpersonal friendship) and three factors underlying cce (identity regulation, coordination and social support). we used these factors to discuss contrasting definitions of community (shared identity versus ego networks). exploratory data analyses also revealed relationships to other student variables that begin to articulate roles and mechanisms for online students' felt community, and raise design implications about what we might do with and for the community structure. in sum, we developed a survey instrument to assess an online learning community with respect to sense of community and collective efficacy. we studied the validity and usefulness of the instrument, both with respect to contrasting definitions of community and to relationships to other student behaviors and attitudes of interest. we contribute our empirical findings to others studying similar phenomena and are particularly interested in research that can complement this work on measuring aspects of community constructs with work on designing more effective online learning environments.",290
SpeechBubbles: Enhancing Captioning Experiences for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing People in Group Conversations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657005,"deaf and hard-of-hearing (dhh) individuals encounter difficulties when engaged in group conversations with hearing individuals, due to factors such as simultaneous utterances from multiple speakers and speakers whom may be potentially out of view. we interviewed and co-designed with eight dhh participants to address the following challenges: 1) associating utterances with speakers, 2) ordering utterances from different speakers, 3) displaying optimal content length, and 4) visualizing utterances from out-of-view speakers. we evaluated multiple designs for each of the four challenges through a user study with twelve dhh participants. our study results showed that participants significantly preferred speechbubble visualizations over traditional captions. these design preferences guided our development of speechbubbles, a real-time speech recognition interface prototype on an augmented reality head-mounted display. from our evaluations, we further demonstrated that dhh participants preferred our prototype over traditional captions for group conversations. we propose speechbubbles, a real-time captioning interface with a bubble-like display to enhance dhh individuals’ group conversation experiences. we interviewed eight dhh individuals and discovered their group conversation issues, and also asked them to co-design ideal visualizations for potential captioning solutions. to better understand user preferences for the prototype design, we conducted a 12-person user study— using comprehension and comfort as factors—to explore several ideal designs for the speech bubble display and hint cues. we evaluated our prototype from the design choices on six participants. their feedback provided potential ideas to further expand our design perspective for enhancing dhh individuals’ group conversation experiences.",291
Juxtapeer: Comparative Peer Review Yields Higher Quality Feedback and Promotes Deeper Reflection,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657006,"peer review asks novices to take on an evaluator's role, yet novices often lack the perspective to accurately assess the quality of others' work. to help learners give feedback on their peers' work through an expert lens, we present the juxtapeer peer review system for structured comparisons. we build on theories of learning through contrasting cases, and contribute the first systematic evaluation of comparative peer review. in a controlled experiment, 476 consenting learners across four courses submitted 1,297 submissions, 4,102 reviews, and 846 self assessments. learners assigned to compare submissions wrote reviews and self-reflections that were longer and received higher ratings from experts than those who evaluated submissions one at a time. a second study found that a ranking of submissions derived from learners' comparisons correlates well with staff ranking. these results demonstrate that comparing algorithmically-curated pairs of submissions helps learners write better feedback. this paper demonstrates how theories of learning through contrasting cases can be applied to peer review, and provides empirical evidence that comparison helps reviewers give better feedback on peers’ work, and more deeply reflect on their own. to scaffold comparative review at scale, we introduce juxtapeer, an online platform which has been evaluated in seven courses from four institutions. learning through examples has traditionally required careful expert curation. these results point to a future where comparing algorithmically curated examples can yield similar benefits in more diverse contexts. for example, job seekers could compare resumes from successful applicants, or newsreaders could study coverage of the same story from multiple sources. in peer review and in the real world, large corpora of examples can help develop nuanced understanding.",292
Evorus: A Crowd-powered Conversational Assistant Built to Automate Itself Over Time,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657007,"crowd-powered conversational assistants have been shown to be more robust than automated systems, but do so at the cost of higher response latency and monetary costs. a promising direction is to combine the two approaches for high quality, low latency, and low cost solutions. in this paper, we introduce evorus, a crowd-powered conversational assistant built to automate itself over time by (i) allowing new chatbots to be easily integrated to automate more scenarios, (ii) reusing prior crowd answers, and (iii) learning to automatically approve response candidates. our 5-month-long deployment with 80 participants and 281 conversations shows that evorus can automate itself without compromising conversation quality. crowd-ai architectures have long been proposed as a way to reduce cost and latency for crowd-powered systems; evorus demonstrates how automation can be introduced successfully in a deployed system. its architecture allows future researchers to make further innovation on the underlying automated components in the context of a deployed open domain dialog system. we introduced evorus, a crowd-powered system conversational assistant built to automate itself over time. informed by two phases of public field deployment and testing with real users, we iteratively designed and refined its flexible framework for open-domain dialog. we imagine a future where thousands of online service providers can develop their own chatbots, not only to serve their own users in a task-specific context, but also to dynamically integrate their services into evorus with the help of the crowd, allowing users to interact freely with thousands of online services via a universal portal. supporting this scale offers opportunities for future research. for example, one direction is to improve the learning framework to support third-party chatbots that also improves overtime, or to better balance between the exploitation and exploration phases (like in a multi-armed bandit problem). evorus could also be used to collect valuable fail cases to enable third-party developers to improve their bots (i.e., when a bot was triggered, but its proposed response was rejected). evorus has three main advantages as compared to previous approaches. first, it is a working system that can serve as a scaffold for automation over time. a core advantage of starting with a working system is that users can talk to evorus naturally from day one, ensuring conversation quality while collecting training data for automation. second, given the oversight of the crowd, evorus has a high tolerance for errors from its automated components. even an imperfect automation component (e.g., chatbots) can contribute to a conversation without hurting quality, which yields more space for algorithms to “explore” different actions (e.g., selecting a chatbot with medium confidence.) finally, evorus allows a mixed group of humans and bots to collaboratively hold open conversations. most automated systems created from crowd work simply use the crowd for data; evorus tightly integrates crowds and machine learning, and provides specific points where automated components can be introduced. this architecture allows each component to be improved, providing a common research harness on which researchers specializing in different areas may innovate and compete. for instance, “response generation” has long been developed in the nlp community; evorus provides a natural evaluate it within a larger conversational system. the flexibility of the evorus framework potentially allows for low cost integration between many online service providers and fluid collaboration between chatbots and human workers to form a single user-facing identity. given the complexity of conversational assistance, evorus is likely to be crowd-powered in part for some time, but we expect it to continue to increasingly rely on automation.",293
"""Play PRBLMS"": Identifying and Correcting Less Accessible Content in Voice Interfaces",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657008,"voice interfaces often struggle with specific types of named content. domain-specific terminology and naming may push the bounds of standard language, especially in domains like music where artistic creativity extends beyond the music itself. artists may name themselves with symbols (e.g. m s c ra) that most standard automatic speech recognition (asr) systems cannot transcribe. voice interfaces also experience difficulty surfacing content whose titles include non-standard spellings, symbols or other ascii characters in place of english letters, or are written using a non-standard dialect. we present a generalizable method to detect content that current voice interfaces underserve by leveraging differences in engagement across input modalities. using this detection method, we develop a typology of content types and linguistic practices that can make content hard to surface. finally, we present a process using crowdsourced annotations to make underserved content more accessible. voice is a rapidly growing way of interacting with consumer-facing applications. we have presented one approach to identify disadvantaged content which can be generalized to other domains. voice interfaces are made up of components based on textual, speech, and behavioral data. groups that are underrepresented in training data, including those with different accents or members of sociolinguistic groups that do not use the majority dialect, will be disadvantaged. similarly, content less likely to occur in large-scale speech training corpora, may be less likely to be recognized. this makes voice applications particularly prone to biases. our case study shows that certain genres of content are more affected. we classified 12 linguistic and stylistic practices that present problems in current voice contexts. it is crucial to discover types of content that experience issues in scalable and easy to apply ways. in our evaluation, we showed our method increased accessibility of previously disadvantaged content. our method focuses specifically on enabling access to diverse content within the music space but this approach is extensible to many other domains. developers are increasingly using public asr apis similar to what our prototype used. for example, take a developer creating an application containing many local, slang or dialectal terms, or app/company-specific terminology, or professionspecific scientific, medical, legal, industrial terms. while some domain-specialized asr services are available (e.g. nuance has medical and legal asr products), for especially smaller developers with special purpose domains, these may not suffice. similar issues will arise when automatically making apps voice-accessible; which commands will and will not work may not be clear. terms may be comparably rare in the data that the general-purpose asr api was trained on. this rarity in training data could then result in the asr api transcribing more common similar-sounding phrases or words rather than the specialized terminology needed. our method could identify these incorrect transcriptions and ensure that they still resolve to the action that the user desired.",294
Exploring the Value of Parent Tracked Baby Data in Interactions with Healthcare Professionals: A Data-Enabled Design Exploration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657009,"this paper presents a designerly exploration of the potential values of parent-tracked baby data in interactions between parents and healthcare professionals (hcps). where previous work has used parent-tracked data as part of the solution to a problem, we contribute by starting our design exploration from data, using it as creative material in our design process. as we intend to work towards a system that could be viable across different levels of care, we invited three different types of hcps and five families with newborns, for a five-week situated design exploration. facilitated by an open and dynamic data collection toolkit, parents and hcps could together decide what data to collect. in a continuous dialogue, they reflected on the relevance of that data in their interaction. based on this, we continuously and remotely developed two concepts. from related previous work, we saw two clear ways in which others have approached data-intensive projects. the first uses data only as part of the solution; the second departs from data and questions how it might be relevant in a given context. the latter, however, always defined what data was used upfront. in this paper, we present a third approach, based on situated and explorative data-enabled design approach. many of our initial insights show a large overlap with those presented in previous work. however, as we moved forward and used different designs to embody these insights, they became more detailed, nuanced and, simply, different; they build on more complex insights from combinations of data in different settings that continuously evolve. in the case study, we have shown how we brought together parents, hcps and design researchers who were enabled to actively contribute by means of the data-enabled canvas. through this, we demonstrated how different stakeholders, as experts in their own areas, together with design researchers have used data as a creative material to allow new design interventions to emerge iteratively, while situated in real life.",295
Tangible Awareness: How Tangibles on Tabletops Influence Awareness of Each Other's Actions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657000,"tangibles on multitouch tabletops increase speed, accuracy, and eyes-free operability for individual users, and verbal and behavioral social interaction among multiple users around smaller tables with a shared focus of attention. modern multitouch tables, however, provide sizes and resolutions that let groups work alongside each other in separate workspaces. but how aware do these users remain of each other's actions, and what impact can tangibles have on their awareness? in our study, groups of 2--4 users around the table played an individual game grabbing their attention as primary task, while they also had to occasionally become aware of other players'actions and react as secondary task. we found that players were significantly more aware of other players'actions using tangibles than those using pure multitouch interaction, indicated by faster reaction times. this effect was especially strong with more players. we close with qualitative user feedback and design recommendations. we found that players were significantly more aware of other players'actions using tangibles than those using pure multitouch interaction, indicated by faster reaction times. this effect was especially strong with more players. we close with qualitative user feedback and design recommendations. we showed that users around a large multitouch tabletop react significantly faster to other users’ actions when those use tangibles instead of multitouch interactions. this indicates a higher awareness of others’ tangible actions. we found that this effect increased with more users, and provide some initial design guidelines for such systems from these and other qualitative findings. a within-groups study with feedback from users after experiencing both tangible and virtual conditions could help better understand how tangibles improve awareness. we chose to use tangibles only for the secondary task to isolate their effect on user awareness, and because we expect that also using them for a primary task will introduce new distractions and thus decrease their beneficial effects on awareness. a follow-up study could help verify and quantify this theory. while commercial tangibles for multitouch surfaces have started to appear, users are not generally familiar with them yet, similarly to when smartphones introduced multitouch gestures. learning effects may thus still play a significant role when studying users interacting with tangibles. since some participants stated that they tried to listen to the sound the tangible made when being moved, we suggest investigating further what types of subtle, inherent feedback tangibles may provide to both the user and collocated actors around a large multitouch table. finally, eye-tracking could reveal even more precise information about users’ current locus of attention and reaction times. for example, it might show if a player who already recognized an incoming attack rather decided to catch another mole before performing his defense.",296
Grand Challenges in Shape-Changing Interface Research,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657001,"shape-changing interfaces have emerged as a new method for interacting with computers, using dynamic changes in a device's physical shape for input and output. with the advances of research into shape-changing interfaces, we see a need to synthesize the main, open research questions. the purpose of this synthesis is to formulate common challenges across the diverse fields engaged in shape-change research, to facilitate progression from single prototypes and individual design explorations to grander scientific goals, and to draw attention to challenges that come with maturity, including those concerning ethics, theory-building, and societal impact. in this article we therefore present 12 grand challenges for research on shape-changing interfaces, derived from a three-day workshop with 25 shape-changing interface experts with backgrounds in design, computer science, human-computer interaction, engineering, robotics, and material science. the field of shape-changing interfaces has greatly expanded during the last few years, showcasing novel technologies and embracing new disciplines. at the same time, the field has matured considerably, and is beginning to converge on key questions surrounding technology, design, theory-building, and societal implications. in this paper we have identified and discussed what we consider the 12 grand challenges currently facing researchers. although there are many examples of shape-changing interfaces that provide delightful experiences and offer better ergonomics, the challenges identified need be addressed to help deliver the full benefits of shape-change. it is important that we also recognize and deal with limitations of shape-changing interfaces and temper this optimism. shneiderman [84] discussed the ten plagues of the information age, many of which apply directly to shape-changing research. in research on proxemics, researchers have discussed sinister “dark patterns” [28], that is, applications of proxemics where users are manipulated and deceived. we appreciate the transparency and open dialogue encouraged by such work, which highlights how things can go wrong. we envision similar negative and even dangerous appropriations of shape-changing interfaces will also occur; understanding and minimising that impact crosses many of the presented challenges. we are excited about the potential of shape-changing interfaces and how they will transform interaction with computing systems. we see the identification of these grand challenges as a positive step in focussing research efforts towards this common goal. these challenges will, no doubt, evolve as technology matures, society changes, and our understanding of users increases. we hope you will join us in developing these interfaces to shape the future of human-computer interaction.",297
Investigating the Role of an Overview Device in Multi-Device Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657002,"the availability of mobile device ecologies enables new types of ad-hoc co-located decision-making and sensemaking practices in which people find, collect, discuss, and share information. however, little is known about what kind of device configurations are suitable for these types of tasks. this paper contributes new insights into how people use configurations of devices for one representative example task: collaborative co-located trip-planning. we present an empirical study that explores and compares three strategies to use multiple devices: no-overview, overview on own device, and a separate overview device. the results show that the overview facilitated decision- and sensemaking during a collaborative trip-planning task by aiding groups to iterate their itinerary, organize locations and timings efficiently, and discover new insights. groups shared and discussed more opinions, resulting in more democratic decision-making. groups provided with a separate overview device engaged more frequently and spent more time in closely-coupled collaboration. in summary, with our study we found trends that the overview allowed users to detect patterns of locations (f1), led to consideration of more factors through a shared understanding (f2), and eventually allowed groups to iterate their itinerary (f4). displaying the overview on a separate device encouraged more closely-coupled collaborations (f5) which resulted in sharing of more information and more active discussions. this in return led to a more democratic decisionmaking process (f3). whilst we observed territorial behaviour with personal devices (f6), the overview device acted as a spatial and contextual focus point for collaborators to initiate discussions (f5) and focus their attention, and aided groups in mediating their collaboration. many previous works have proposed cross-device and multidevice interactions and systems for collaborative works, but only few have been studied in everyday practices. whilst our study was conducted in the lab and with the focus on a specific activity – collaborative trip planning – we believe that the insights show merits for real-world collaborative multidevice settings. we showed how changing device configuration benefits groups’ exchange of information and their collaboration during their sensemaking and decision-making activity. this is promising for future work on deploying multidevice systems in everyday situations.",298
Greater than the Sum of its PARTs: Expressing and Reusing Design Intent in 3D Models,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657003,"with the increasing popularity of consumer-grade 3d printing, many people are creating, and even more using, objects shared on sites such as thingiverse. however, our formative study of 962 thingiverse models shows a lack of re-use of models, perhaps due to the advanced skills needed for 3d modeling. an end user program perspective on 3d modeling is needed. our framework (parts) empowers amateur modelers to graphically specify design intent through geometry. parts includes a gui, scripting api and exemplar library of assertions which test design expectations and integrators which act on intent to create geometry. parts lets modelers integrate advanced, model specific functionality into designs, so that they can be re-used and extended, without programming. in two workshops, we show that parts helps to create 3d printable models, and modify existing models more easily than with a standard tool. 3d printing enables users to fabricate new objects. however, creating geometry that will function in the real-world is difficult, and so many users print models that others have created. unfortunately, as shown in our workshop, nonexperts can find it difficult to customize such models, even when they are carefully parameterized. standard tools do not explicitly express design intent, leaving a gap between form and function. parts is at its essence one of the first 3d modeling tools to support end-user programming concepts, thus helping to bridge this gap. parts brings design intent to the forefront of the design process. with functional geometry, designers can create reusable designs that capture design intent and support future modelers. in the future, we hope to build on lessons learned and explore how parts can support different modelers by creating customized domain specific libraries and implement more complex systems. by building more complex ways of expressing and acting on design intent, we hope to increase the engineering quality of results in parts. at the moment, parts is a powerful first step in enabling non-experts to make use of their common practices in a reusable fashion.",299
Calling for a Revolution: An Analysis of IoT Manifestos,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657004,"designers and developers are increasingly writing manifestos to express frustration and uncertainty as they struggle to negotiate between the possibilities that iot technologies offer, and the ethical concerns they engender. manifestos are defining of a 'moment of crisis' and their recent proliferation indicates a desire for change. we analyze the messages manifesto authors have for their readers. emerging from a sense of uncertainty, these manifestos create publics for debate, demand attention and call for change. while manifestos provide potential roadmaps for a better future, they also express a deep concern and even fear of the state of the world and the role of technology in it. we highlight how practitioners are responding to unstable and rapidly changing times and detail what solutions they envision, and what conflicts these might bring about. our analysis suggests new ways hci might theorize and design for responsibility while attending to the perils of responsibilisation.",300
Share and Share Alike?: Social Information and Interaction Style in Coordination of Shared Use,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657015,"interfaces are commonly designed from the perspective of individual users, even though most of the systems we use in everyday life are in fact shared. we argue that more attention is needed for system sharing, especially because interfaces are known to influence coordination of shared use. in this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of this relation. to do so, we design three interfaces for a shared lighting system that vary in the type of social information they allow people to share with others and in their overall interaction style. we systematically compare longitudinal and real-life use of the interfaces, evaluating (1) people's appraisal of three types of social information and (2) the influence of an interaction style on coordination of shared use. the results disclose relations between the interface and the amount of verbal communication, consideration, and accountability. with this work, we urge the need for interaction designers to consider shared use. in this work, we have investigated how the design of an interface (in terms of social information and interaction style) can influence coordination of shared use, and we have provided in-depth insights into the social dynamics that evolved around that coordination. we found that design decisions in the interface can impact coordination by stimulating verbal communication and negotiation, by helping people to take each other into consideration and adjust their interactions accordingly, and by increasing feelings of accountability. we also found that although intention, authorship, and preference are potentially useful information types, people need the information at the right moment, should be able to estimate the relevance of the information, and interpret what a lack of information means to make the information useful in coordination of shared use. to conclude, if interfaces are designed from an individual perspective, there is a risk that they do not support people in shared settings and shared use. therefore, we emphasize the importance of considering shared use when designing interfaces for everyday systems.",301
What's the Difference?: Evaluating Variations of Multi-Series Bar Charts for Visual Comparison Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657016,"an increasingly common approach to data analysis involves using information dashboards to visually compare changing data. however, layout constraints coupled with varying levels of visualization literacy among dashboard users make facilitating visual comparison in dashboards a challenging task. in this paper, we evaluate variants of bar charts, one of the most prevalent class of charts used in dashboards. we report an online experiment (n = 74) conducted to evaluate four alternative designs: 1) grouped bar chart, 2) grouped bar chart with difference overlays, 3) bar chart with difference overlays, and 4) difference bar chart. results show that charts with difference overlays facilitate a wider range of comparison tasks while performing comparably to charts without them on individual tasks. finally, we discuss the implications of our findings, with a focus on supporting visual comparison in dashboards. we presented a study that evaluated four variants of multiseries bar charts in terms of their capacity for facilitating comparison tasks. our choice of chart designs was motivated and also constrained by the context of information dashboards, where both bar charts and comparison tasks are particularly prevalent. we chose the four chart designs according to recent classifications of comparison appearing in the visualization literature [17, 24]. the results of our online experiment with 74 participants indicated that charts with difference overlays, or hybrid designs that combine aspects of juxtaposition and explicit encoding with superposition, are just as good or better than solely juxtaposition or explicit encoding based charts on individual tasks. additionally, these hybrid designs have the advantage that they afford more tasks by combining elements of juxtaposition and explicit encoding-based designs. we discussed key observations regarding difference overlays and the potential implications of these in the context of information dashboards. finally, we highlighted limitations of the current study and open areas for future research such as how difference overlays can be used to enhance the storytelling capabilities of information dashboards.",302
Eliciting Users' Demand for Interface Features,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657017,"how valuable are certain interface features to their users? how can users' demand for features be quantified? to address these questions, users' demand curve for the sorting feature was elicited in a controlled experiment, using personal finance as the user context. users made ten rounds of investment allocation across up to 77 possible funds, thus encountering choice overload, typical of many online environments. users were rewarded for positive investment returns. to overcome choice overload, users could sort the alternatives based on product attributes (fees, category, fund name, past performance). to elicit their demand for sorting, the experimental design enabled users to forgo 0%-9% of their reward in return for activating the sorting feature. the elicited downward sloping demand curve suggests a curvilinear relationship between sorting use and cost. more broadly, the study offers a way to quantify user demand of ui features, and a basis for comparison between features. we conclude with a call for more hci research using economic theory and tools. as a discipline that studies allocation of scarce resources [32], economics has developed a set of tools and methods to study people’s choices in various circumstances. with the growing constraints placed on resources such as users’ time, attention and screen real estate, hci researchers and practitioners can benefit from using more economic theory to better understand users and inform designers.",303
The Space of Possibilities: Political Economies of Technology Innovation in Sub-Saharan Africa,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657018,"hci researchers work within spaces of possibility for potential designs of technology. new methods (e.g., user centrism); expected types of interaction (user with device); and potential applications (urban navigation) can extend the boundaries of these possibilities. however, structural and systemic factors can also foreclose them. a recent wide and shallow survey of 116 individuals involved in technology development across 26 countries in sub-saharan africa reveals how factors of political economy significantly impact upon technological possibilities. monopolies, international power dynamics, race, and access to capital open or constrain technological possibilities at least as much as device-centric or user-focused constraints do. though their thrust may have been anticipated by reference to political economic trends, the structural constraints we found were underestimated by technologists even a decade ago. we discuss the implications for technology development in africa and beyond.",304
"""Genderfluid"" or ""Attack Helicopter"": Responsible HCI Research Practice with Non-binary Gender Variation in Online Communities",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657019,"as non-binary genders become increasingly prevalent, researchers face decisions in how to collect, analyze and interpret research participants' genders. we present two case studies on surveys with thousands of respondents, of which hundreds reported gender as something other than simply women or men. first, tumblr, a blogging platform, resulted in a rich set of gender identities with very few aggressive or resistive responses; the second case study, online fantasy football, yielded opposite proportions. by focusing on variation rather than dismissing non-binary responses as noise, we suggest that researchers can better capture gender in a way that 1) addresses gender variation without othering or erasing non-binary respondents; and 2) minimizes ""trolls'"" opportunity to use surveys as a mischief platform. the analyses of these two distinct case studies find significant gender differences in community dimensions of participation in both networked spaces as well as offering a model for inclusive mixed-methods hci research. this study presents descriptive qualitative findings and quantitative analysis from two independent surveys that ask about gender and behavior in online communities. as hci researchers continue to make use of qualitative and quantitative methods, we offer guidelines and a practical case study in the careful and ethical analyses of gender beyond the binary in survey methods. we argue that careful and sensitive study design, analysis and interpretation is an important commitment for the hci research community. by probing our categories, we can better excavate our biases and blind spots, facilitating a more inclusive and exhaustive field of inquiry moving forward. to do so, we recommend taking up the approach of infrastructural inversion set out by [11]. in the case of gender, the binary categories of man and woman are the dominant scaffolding that shape our understanding of the social world [45]. by inverting the question to ask users to identify their categories without binary constraints, we uncovered nuance and variation among our respondents that moves beyond binary categories and instead reflects users’ range of identity and expression. we encourage quantitative and qualitative researchers within the hci community to account for and be inclusive of marginalized (non-binary) gender populations within data sets. we hope our research is a starting point for future studies in which non-binary gender data is given more attention and inclusion. categories, by definition, delimit what we can know about the social world. as such, on principle and for empirical reasons, we make the infrastructure of our methods and analysis categories visible.",305
"“Debrief O'Clock”: Planning, Recording, and Making Sense of a Day in the Field in Design Research",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657010,"design research is generative, intuitive, experiential, and tactical. documenting the design research process helps to communicate these decisions, judgements, and values that are embodied in design products. yet, practices for documenting design research are underreported in the chi community, particularly for immersive design research field studies. we contribute the ""debrief o'clock"" fieldnote practice for documenting design research field studies, comprising collaborative discussion sessions and the production of written research accounts. we show how the debrief o'clock practice emerged in the context of a digital community noticeboard project with a very remote australian aboriginal community, and explain three key purposes of debrief o'clock as: 1) an early stage data recording and analysis process; 2) a tactical manoeuvre in responsive project planning; and 3) a mechanism for personal debriefing and reflexivity. we conclude with a series of open practical, ethical, and methodological questions to advance the discussion of design research documentation practices. design research documentation is a valuable resource for telling the story of a project through time and making visible the intuitions, judgements, and values that are embodied in design products. the contribution of this paper is to make clear that through our design fieldwork, we have found that design decisions, theories, and outcomes do not emerge from a one-off structured analysis of data gathered through systematic means. rather, they emerge from a reflective summarising of the day’s events, and resultant tactical shifts and insights that arise in an iterative process over many days, weeks, or months. we offer the debrief o’clock fieldnote practice as an approach to support design fieldwork and theory development. we feel that fieldnote practices such as debrief o’clock can enhance design research dissemination by communicating the integrative and experiential processes that have shaped design work. we believe in the value of continuing the discussion of the practical, ethical, and methodological concerns relating to design research documentation practices, in order to learn from each other and be attentive to the blind spots in our methods.",306
Family Health Promotion in Low-SES Neighborhoods: A Two-Month Study of Wearable Activity Tracking,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657011,"low-socioeconomic status (ses) families face increased barriers to physical activity (pa)-a behavior critical for reducing and preventing chronic disease. research has explored how wearable pa trackers can encourage increased activity, and how the adoption of such trackers is driven by people's emotions and social needs. however, more work is needed to understand how pa trackers are perceived and adopted by low-ses families, where pa may be deprioritized due to economic stresses, limited resources, and perceived crime. accordingly, we conducted a two-month, in-depth qualitative study, exploring low-ses caregivers' perspectives on pa tracking and promotion. our findings show how pa tracking was impacted by caregivers' attitudes toward safety, which were influenced by how they perceived social connections within their neighborhoods; and cognitive-emotional processes. we conclude that pa tracking tools for low-ses families should help caregivers and children to experience and celebrate progress. wearable physical activity (pa) tracking use cannot be separated from the social connections and the emotional experiences that families have. our qualitative study with families in low-socioeconomic status neighborhoods shows that the efficacy of pa trackers can be limited by caregivers’ perceptions of crime. it was the depth of social contacts that caregivers had in their neighborhoods that helped empower them to be resilient in the face of disempowering narratives of crime. furthermore, caregivers’ explanations for their success or failure (as depicted by the pa trackers) were associated with emotional responses that could motivate or dissuade pa. therefore, rather than presenting whether a goal was achieved or missed, we suggest that family pa trackers should guide caregivers and children to experience and celebrate progress.",307
Crowdsourcing vs Laboratory-Style Social Acceptability Studies?: Examining the Social Acceptability of Spatial User Interactions for Head-Worn Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657012,"the use of crowdsourcing platforms for data collection in hci research is attractive in their ability to provide rapid access to large and diverse participant samples. as a result, several researchers have conducted studies investigating the similarities and differences between data collected through crowdsourcing and more traditional, laboratory-style data collection. we add to this body of research by examining the feasibility of conducting social acceptability studies via crowdsourcing. social acceptability can be a key determinant for the early adoption of emerging technologies, and as such, we focus our investigation on social acceptability for head-worn display (hwd) input modalities. our results indicate that data collected via a crowdsourced experiment and a laboratory-style setting did not differ at a statistically significant level. these results provide initial support for crowdsourcing platforms as viable options for conducting social acceptability research. we reported on the results of a study comparing social acceptability ratings of hwds interaction techniques among users in laboratory-style study and a remote crowdsourcing platform. our results showed that, overall, data collected from both groups are similar and suggest that there is potential feasibility for running social acceptability studies of new technologies using crowdsourcing platforms if the data is treated carefully.",308
Empirical Support for a Causal Relationship Between Gamification and Learning Outcomes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657013,"preparing for exams is an important yet stressful time for many students. self-testing is known to be an effective preparation strategy, yet some students lack motivation to engage or persist in self-testing activities. adding game elements to a platform supporting self-testing may increase engagement and, by extension, exam performance. we conduct a randomized controlled experiment (n=701) comparing the effect of two game elements -- a points system and a badge system -- used individually and in combination. we find that the badge system elicits significantly higher levels of voluntary self-testing activity and this effect is particularly pronounced amongst a relatively small cohort. importantly, this increased activity translates to a significant improvement in exam scores. our data supports a causal relationship between gamification and learning outcomes, mediated by self-testing behavior. this provides empirical support for landers' theory of gamified learning when the gamified activity is conducted prior to measuring learning outcomes. we investigated the use of two common gamification elements, points and badges, to influence the study behavior of students prior to a high-stakes final exam. our results showed that the presence of the game elements in the user interface of our tool caused a 37% increase in the median number of answers that students submitted (h1). our badge system encouraged goal setting behavior, and was more effective than our points system which lacked clear targets and included components that students could not directly control. in our implementation, combining the points and badge systems did not lead to higher levels of student activity (h2). there was a strong positive relationship between the number of questions students answered during practice and their subsequent exam performance (h3), and this acted as a mediator in the relationship between gamification and exam outcomes (h4). of particular note, the presence of the badge system led to a 23% improvement in exam scores for the most active students. this work provides unique empirical support for landers’ theory of gamified learning and illustrates that game elements targeting productive student behaviors can be used in online tools to positively impact learning outcomes.",309
Going the Distance: Trust Work for Citizen Participation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657014,"trust is a vital component of citizen participation-whether citizens decide to engage in opportunities for participation in local government can hinge entirely on the existence of trust between citizens and public officials. understanding the role of trust in this space is vital for hci and the growing area of digital civics which works to improve or create new modes of citizen participation. currently, however, trust is understudied from the perspectives of public officials. this gap creates a critical blind spot as technical interventions may be mismatched to the ways trust is put into action by public officials working to support citizen participation. we begin to address this gap by presenting a broad qualitative study of how public officials in a large us city operationalize trust in citizen participation. we found trust is enacted through ongoing practices that man-age distance in relationships between public officials and city residents. public officials view trust as essential to enable citizen participation in local government. this was made clear by how many aspects of the work performed by public officials (how a service is provided or a planning process arranged) can be constrained, limited, or enhanced depending on the level of trust (or distrust). for this reason, trust work often comes to be its own distinct mode of work entirely. trust occurs through both interpersonal and institutional relationships that rely on different characteristics of trust such as transparency, honesty, and predictability. across the eight salient practices of trust work we found, there was a unifying goal to traverse various manifestations of distance: distance in social familiarity, distance in domain knowledge, distance in decision making-power, distance in temporal length, distance in physical proximity and distance in hypothetical uncertainty. these distances combine to produce risk and uncertainty in citizen participation efforts. ideally, these distances could be eliminated but more often they can only be reduced temporarily thus leaving risk in place. this is where trust comes into play—as trust is a mechanism allowing for action in the face of risk. technology and design will have a role to play in “going the distance” but to do so we need to understand how trust develops within the relationships, risks and expectations that characterize citizen participation.",310
Methods for Intentional Encoding of High Capacity Human-Designable Visual Markers,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657025,"previous techniques for human-designable visual markers have focused on small encoding spaces, and assume artists do not need to encode specific bit representations. we present a general framework for human-designable visual markers for artists to encode specific bit representations in large spaces. a three-part study, conducted over three weeks, methodically evaluates the usability of different encoding methods when artists encode specific bit representations. the methods span different shape characteristics suitable for artist encoding (convexity, hollowness, number, size, and distance from centroid) and visualization tools are proposed to aid in this process. we further demonstrate that any of the methods presented may be practically used to encode a url with the aid of a universally available database like tinyurl (rather than a task-specific database), making human-designable visual markers practical for applications such as advertisements. in this work, we have approached the problem of drawing visual markers while intentionally matching a target encoding, and developed a drawing application with built-in tools to ease that process. we presented a general framework for creating new encoding schemes based on the region adjacency tree proposed by costanza and huang [5], and conducted a three phase user study to evaluate several of these schemes. this study has shown that, although designers tend to prefer encoding schemes that impose few restrictions and have a low information density, it is possible for them to persevere and produce viable markers with any of the schemes tested.",311
Investigating the Impact of Annotation Interfaces on Player Performance in Distributed Multiplayer Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657026,"in distributed multiplayer games, it can be difficult to communicate strategic information for planning game moves and player interactions. often, players spend extra time communicating, reducing their engagement in the game. visual annotations in game maps and in the gameworld can address this problem and result in more efficient player communication. we studied the impact of real-time feedback on planning annotations, specifically two different annotation types, in a custom-built, third-person, multiplayer game and analyzed their effects on player performance, experience, workload, and annotation use. we found that annotations helped engage players in collaborative planning, which reduced frustration, and shortened goal completion times. based on these findings, we discuss how annotating in virtual game spaces enables collaborative planning and improves team performance. our study continues prior research that investigated the impact of ccms on player performance in collaborative games [34, 49, 52, 59]. we focused on the effect of using annotations on player performance, workload, and experience in distributed multiplayer games and how they engage players in collaborative planning. we found that annotation tools improved actual and perceived performance, reduced frustation, and enhanced communication. moreover, the use of annotations increased when these annotations are visible in the gameworld and map when compared to only being visible on the map. furthermore, we identified five different use cases for the annotations: real-time way-guiding, marking locations and objects, handwriting messages, expressing emotions, and spamming. based on these findings, we see an opportunity to design games that focus on engaging players in collaborative planning tasks. using annotations in games opens up further research on how different gestures and non-verbal communication can be used to facilitate remote planning and collaborations. this study helps us define potential advantages of annotation interfaces and their implications for the design of collaborative games. these annotation tools could have further benefits beyond games; for example in virtual training scenarios such as disaster response training.",312
"Let's Talk About Race: Identity, Chatbots, and AI",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657027,"why is it so hard for chatbots to talk about race? this work explores how the biased contents of databases, the syntactic focus of natural language processing, and the opaque nature of deep learning algorithms cause chatbots difficulty in handling race-talk. in each of these areas, the tensions between race and chatbots create new opportunities for people and machines. by making the abstract and disparate qualities of this problem space tangible, we can develop chatbots that are more capable of handling race-talk in its many forms. our goal is to provide the hci community with ways to begin addressing the question, how can chatbots handle race-talk in new and improved ways? in writing this paper, we set two essential questions to guide this work: 1) how can chatbots handle race in new and improved ways? and 2) why is race-talk so difficult for chatbots? these questions have taken us down many paths to understand how race-talk is interwoven with technical configurations supporting chatbots. an important contribution of this research is helping hci practitioners understand how specific technosocial configurations are fundamentally entangled with their work. by drawing together technosocial interactions involved in race-talk and hate speech relative to databases, nlp, and ml, we strive to support the development of generative technosocial solutions——like a multiplicity of chatbots that upend the all-knowing agent. chatbots are already exacerbating social harm specific to race. in working to mitigate these harms, there is potential for novel racefocused developments for chatbots specifically and for ai generally, like building off of work in raciolinguistics. this work also makes contributions for hci practitioners broadly concerned with identity, race, or equity in design. we demonstrate how social and technical conditions develop together in ways that must be reckoned with when forming human-machine interactions. for nlp and ml practitioners (and others who work with bots), seeing the connection between known problems and ethically critical topics like race is important. hard problems in ai require practitioners to develop context specific solutions (i.e., focused on humor, language, or race). staying with the trouble is not about neat resolutions. it is about embracing the complexities of our lives to enable better, though still troubled, paths forward. clarifying a context, like race, and its manifestations can help guide these efforts. through making tangible the abstract and disparate qualities of race and chatbots, this paper works as a synthetic guide, pointing us towards possible futures where chatbots are more capable of handling race-talk in its many forms. the one question left is, what is the racial context of your chatbot?",313
Extracting Regular FOV Shots from 360 Event Footage,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657028,"video summaries are a popular way to share important events, but creating good summaries is hard. it requires expertise in both capturing and editing footage. while hiring a professional videographer is possible, this is too costly for most casual events. an alternative is to place 360 video cameras around an event space to capture footage passively and then extract regular field-of-view (rfov) shots for the summary. this paper focuses on the problem of extracting such rfov shots. since we cannot actively control the cameras or the scene, it is hard to create ""ideal' shots that adhere strictly to traditional cinematography rules. to better understand the tradeoffs, we study human preferences for static and moving camera rfov shots generated from 360 footage. from the findings, we derive design guidelines. as a secondary contribution, we use these guidelines to develop automatic algorithms that we demonstrate in a prototype user interface for extracting rfov shots from 360 videos. the improving quality and diversity of commercial cameras makes it possible to explore new capture configurations for a range of different applications. we focus on the task of creating video summaries of social events and propose the use of static 360 video cameras to acquire footage. a key advantage of this setup is that the cameras can capture large portions of the event in a passive way that does not require a dedicated videographer. our work takes initial steps towards identifying common challenges and tradeoffs in extracting good rfov shots from 360 event footage. by analyzing viewer preferences, we find that central framings and smooth camera moves are generally preferred, but in many cases, the arrangement of people and objects in the scene require that we take into account other objectives, like avoiding distractors, awkward cropping boundaries, and distortion due overly wide fovs. in addition, our automated algorithms provide preliminary evidence that these design guidelines can be operationalized to extract good shots from 360 footage with small amounts of user input. looking ahead, there are still many open questions around the best ways to make use of 360 cameras to produce rfov video. however, we believe our work represents a valuable stepping stone for future research on this topic.",314
“Is More Better?”: Impact of Multiple Photos on Perception of Persona Profiles,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657029,"in this research, we investigate if and how more photos than a single headshot can heighten the level of information provided by persona profiles. we conduct eye-tracking experiments and qualitative interviews with variations in the photos: a single headshot, a headshot and images of the persona in different contexts, and a headshot with pictures of different people representing key persona attributes. the results show that more contextual photos significantly improve the information end users derive from a persona profile; however, showing images of different people creates confusion and lowers the informativeness. moreover, we discover that choice of pictures results in various interpretations of the persona that are biased by the end users' experiences and preconceptions. the results imply that persona creators should consider the design power of photos when creating persona profiles. in conclusion, we postulate that there is a tradeoff between informativeness and perceptional bias when increasing the number of information elements in persona profiles. determining the optimum calls for awareness of how the information is perceived by the end users. consequently, more research is needed to determine the ideal persona layout in terms of information content and type in a variety of contexts. methods such as multivariate testing with live users can help in approaching the development of the optimal persona profiles. moreover, results point to that, when developing personas, the end users in the organization need to be taken into account prior to deciding on the information content of the persona profile.",315
Speak Up: A Multi-Year Deployment of Games to Motivate Speech Therapy in India,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657020,"the ability to communicate is crucial to leading an independent life. unfortunately, individuals from developing communities who are deaf and hard of hearing tend to encounter difficulty communicating, due to a lack of educational resources. we present findings from a two-year deployment of speak up, a suite of voice-powered games to motivate speech therapy, at a school for the deaf in india. using ethnographic methods, we investigated the interplay between speak up and local educational practices. we found that teachers' speech therapy goals had evolved to differ from those encoded in the games, that the games influenced classroom dynamics, and that teachers had improved their computer literacy and developed creative uses for the games. we used these insights to further enhance speak up by creating an explicit teacher role in the games, making changes that encouraged teachers to build their computer literacy, and adding an embodied agent. in this paper, we described ethnographic insights generated from two-weeks of fieldwork in an indian school for children who are dhoh and our simultaneous technology iteration on the speak up games. this paper documents the unexpected ways in which speak up was used and influenced classroom dynamics, and how we incorporated those insights into the technology development process. it demonstrates the need for and documents a case study of explicitly making capacity building the focus of technology development for underserved communities. lastly, it introduces initial findings regarding the potential for embodied physical agents to enhance educational technologies for children in resource-constrained settings. there are a few notable limitations of this research. first, the power differential and language barrier between the researcher and the community hindered our ability to get accurate information about the game usage. secondly, the novelty aspect may have influenced how students used speak up – although they had used the games for two years, the presence of a researcher from america likely made them more excited than usual to use the games. lastly, the timeline of this research – the fact that it consisted of two fieldwork visits two years apart – hindered our ability to get accurate information about and support the teachers in their game usage during the interim. this work opens exciting avenues for future research. on the ethnographic front, it motivates follow-up directions of study including: what the long-term effects of the hierarchy that develops in speech class are; how long-term usage of the embodied physical agent impacts classroom dynamics; and how students think about and perceive value in speak up. on the technological front, it prompts further work on speech recognition to understand student pronunciation; one way to ensure that such research is community-centric is by using the existing games to record anonymized voice data that then informs the design of a speech recognition system. lastly, on the capacity building front, this work motivates further research into how to measure the impact of capacity building in ictd research, both within technological tools and in more general interactions between researchers and the community.",316
Understanding the Effect of In-Video Prompting on Learners and Instructors,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657021,"online instructional videos are ubiquitous, but it is difficult for instructors to gauge learners' experience and their level of comprehension or confusion regarding the lecture video. moreover, learners watching the videos may become disengaged or fail to reflect and construct their own understanding. this paper explores instructor and learner perceptions of in-video prompting where learners answer reflective questions while watching videos. we conducted two studies with crowd workers to understand the effect of prompting in general, and the effect of different prompting strategies on both learners and instructors. results show that some learners found prompts to be useful checkpoints for reflection, while others found them distracting. instructors reported the collected responses to be generally more specific than what they have usually collected. also, different prompting strategies had different effects on the learning experience and the usefulness of responses as feedback. this paper investigated the effects of in-video prompting on both learners and instructors. in-video prompting enables instructors to collect specific comments from learners. to understand how in-video prompting affects the learning experience, we conducted two studies with crowd workers. results showed that different prompting strategies have different effects on the learning experience. learners perceive that learning-centered questions are less interrupting, more enjoyable, and more helpful for learning. interviews with instructors revealed that in-video prompting gives specific comments to them and that responses from experience-centered questions are more actionable. instructional designers emphasized the importance of coupling question design with instructional design components for more useful feedback.",317
Force Jacket: Pneumatically-Actuated Jacket for Embodied Haptic Experiences,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657022,"immersive experiences seek to engage the full sensory system in ways that words, pictures, or touch alone cannot. with respect to the haptic system, however, physical feedback has been provided primarily with handheld tactile experiences or vibration-based designs, largely ignoring both pressure receptors and the full upper-body area as conduits for expressing meaning that is consistent with sight and sound. we extend the potential for immersion along these dimensions with the force jacket, a novel array of pneumatically-actuated airbags and force sensors that provide precisely directed force and high frequency vibrations to the upper body. we describe the pneumatic hardware and force control algorithms, user studies to verify perception of airbag location and pressure magnitude, and subsequent studies to define full-torso, pressure and vibration-based feel effects such as punch, hug, and snake moving across the body. we also discuss the use of those effects in prototype virtual reality applications. this paper introduces force jacket, a novel wearable haptic interface that can provide strong and variable forces to the upper body along with vibrotactile sensations, using pneumatically actuated airbags. this system offers the unique capability of delivering haptic actuation over large areas with a relatively low number of actuators, as compared to conventional techniques. furthermore, the use of inflatable airbags offers the ability to apply strong static pressure to the user as well as high frequency vibrations, which is not possible with other techniques. to validate the efficacy of this approach a series of user studies have been conducted to evaluate basic human perception of this type of haptic actuation in terms of location and magnitude on the user’s body. these findings were incorporated into a haptic effects editor that allows designers and engineers to create custom higher order haptic effects, and a second users study was conducted to create a library of haptic sensations. finally, this library of effects was used to enhance three virtual reality experiences. ultimately the force jacket provides a new haptic actuation method that can deliver far more immersive experiences by engaging the whole body.",318
Toward Health Information Technology that Supports Overweight/Obese Women in Addressing Emotion- and Stress-Related Eating,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657023,"emotion- and stressed-related eating (esre) is associated with weight management difficulties and is more likely to affect women than men. additionally, health information technology (hit) for weight management tends to be less effective for women than it is for men, and less effective for people who engage in esre. therefore, this study explores how hit can support overweight/obese women curb esre behavior. study participants, all adult overweight/obese women (bmi ' 25), logged dietary intake for 10 days with the lose it! smartphone app as an elicitation exercise. cross sectional, semi-structured interviews (n = 22) were then conducted to explore technology support needs concerning esre behavior. findings revealed participants had the following needs: holistic health goal development, building motivation to achieve goals, and assistance with handling stress. resulting hit guidelines include supporting holistic health goals, developing and sustaining motivation, exchange of emotional support, understanding of behavior, and change in esre mindset. study findings showed the unique needs of overweight/obese women for technology support in the areas of: 1) holistic health goals, 2) initiating and sustaining motivation; 3) venting and processing emotions, 4) real time eating awareness, 5) understanding behavior and changing mindset, and 6) simultaneous tracking of emotions and dietary intake to facilitate such understanding. prevailing hit interventions provide limited support in relation to such needs. accordingly, findings suggest new directions for improving hit design for esre, a behavior more common in women. notably, although women make up the majority of subjects in weight loss intervention studies [21] and are the weight management market’s main target population [36], there has been a dearth of interventions that address their specific needs. accordingly, by focusing on the needs of overweight/obese women in particular, results hold potential for improving design for the largest group of digital weight loss intervention users.",319
Parody in Place: Exposing Socio-spatial Exclusions in Data-Driven Maps with Design Parody,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657024,"this paper describes the development of parody in place, a design parody that depicts seattle neighborhoods with typographic arrangements derived from data generated by technology platforms such as yelp and zillow. the project invites inquiry into what technology corporations make matter and where, in ways that challenge the neutrality of neighborhood-based data. we designed the subject of our parody, a mock company called dork posters, to explore how the modes of parody by which the system operates expose socio-spatial exclusions both contested and propagated by digital platforms. our interventions reveal shifts in response toward mapping techniques, from ambivalence to curiosity. we used dork posters to question reductionist techniques of data aggregation and ad hoc theories of data provenance. our engagements also prompted reflection on the politics of measurement: how data sources shape result- ing insights and valuations. we end by discussing possibilities for expanding the design research program within human-computer interaction through parody. with parody in place we have sought to extend hci’s concerns for mapping and research through design fiction to consider the sociopolitical consequences of data-driven maps. our goal was not to surface implicit biases (e.g., through a data dump) nor to produce the best of all possible maps or mapping algorithms. rather we sought to explore alternative ideas of mapping implicated within elite design and technology networks. we wanted to bring a sense of irony, curiosity and exploration to the process of inquiry in order to elicit conversations and insights that we would have otherwise missed. our hope was to expose different approaches to making sense of neighborhood-based data by calling attention to contemporary narratives that define the influence of socio-spatial data on the city of seattle, wa.",320
From Scanning Brains to Reading Minds: Talking to Engineers about Brain-Computer Interface,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657035,"we presented software engineers in the san francisco bay area with a working brain-computer interface (bci) to surface the narratives and anxieties around these devices among technical practitioners. despite this group's heterogeneous beliefs about the exact nature of the mind, we find a shared belief that the contents of the mind will someday be ""read' or ""decoded' by machines. our findings help illuminate bci's imagined futures among engineers. we highlight opportunities for researchers to involve themselves preemptively in this nascent space of intimate biosensing devices, suggesting our findings' relevance to long-term futures of privacy and cybersecurity. as engineers in the san francisco bay area, the participants in our study sit at an historical site of techno/political power. our technology probe indicates these engineers believe the mind is physical, and therefore amenable to sensing. what are the consequences for the rest of us? we hope our study will encourage engineers to closely examine the potential of these devices for social harm, and encourage researchers to remain closely attuned to this emerging class of consumer biosensor.",321
Crowdsourcing Exercise Plans Aligned with Expert Guidelines and Everyday Constraints,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657036,"exercise plans help people implement behavior change. crowd workers can help create exercise plans for clients, but their work may result in lower quality plans than produced by experts. we built crowdfit, a tool that provides feedback about compliance with exercise guidelines and leverages strengths of crowdsourcing to create plans made by non-experts. we evaluated crowdfit in a comparative study with 46 clients using exercise plans for two weeks. clients received plans from crowd planners using crowdfit, crowd planners without crowdfit, or from expert planners. compared to crowd planners not using crowdfit, crowd planners using crowdfit created plans that are more actionable and more aligned with exercise guidelines. compared to experts, crowd planners created more actionable plans, and plans that are not significantly different with respect to tailoring, strength and aerobic principles. they struggled, however, to satisfy exercise requirements of amount of exercise. we discuss opportunities for designing technology supporting physical activity planning by non-experts. our results demonstrate that crowd workers can create exercise plans that did not significantly differ in quality from expert plans on criteria of tailoring, balance, strength and aerobic guidelines. feedback about amount and balance helped the crowd follow the relevant guidelines while creating the plan. we find that rich user profiles and exercise databases can facilitate tailoring plans to the needs of clients and requirements of national guidelines. the crowd workers reconciled competing constraints, such as following national recommendations while also satisfying various personal needs that clients have. techniques used in crowdfit can successfully enable non-experts to take on tasks that otherwise performed by professional coaches.",322
Bottom-Up Imaginaries: The Cultural-Technical Practice of Inventing Regional Advantage through IT R&D,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657037,"recent hci research on social creativity and bottom-up innovation has highlighted how concerted efforts by the government policy and business communities to develop innovation ecosystems are increasingly intertwined with it research and development. we note that many such efforts focus on cultivating regional advantage [20] in the form of innovation hubs that are situated in and leverage distinct sociocultural histories and geographies. cultivating regional advantage entails achieving broad consensus about what that region's advantage might be, that is, the construction of a regional advantage imaginary beyond the policies, it supports, and practices to make it happen. here, we document how an ongoing public debate among makers and manufacturers in taiwan as a region-distinguished by direct engagement with design, fabrication, prototyping, and manufacturing processes-are proposing pathways toward a regional advantage that both reflects taiwan's recent sociocultural and economic histories and also its near future aspirations. this research contributes hci research on supporting creativity at scale. if an understanding of organizations and institutions was required to understand creative communities of practice [10], then it seems that understanding regional innovation entails an understanding of creativity as a cultural process. specifically, cultural issues are tied up in it innovation agendas in at least two ways. first, creativity itself is situated in cultural traditions such as the arts; and second, developing regional advantage in the form of an innovation ecology entails leveraging distinctive features of one’s culture. focusing primarily on the latter, we have highlighted how bottom-up imaginaries of innovation are both mediated by sociotechnical systems (in this case, facebook) and are likely to result in the development/appropriation of sociotechnical systems at scale to support these imaginaries (in this case, the hope for the next facebook—from taiwan). we have demonstrated the complex threads that tie it innovation to cultural dispositions (e.g., artistic creativity, attitudes towards risk and failure, etc.), and to social policy (e.g., the pragmatic challenge posed by kpi of innovation). we saw that the pursuit of taiwan’s regional advantage at times seemed to entail a rejection of taiwanese culture itself, a deep ideological contradiction that revealed how it agendas cloak themselves in mythmaking, and that these myths can be demonstrably (counter-) productive. one aspect of supporting creativity and innovation at the regional scale is, therefore, attending to the subtle yet efficacious (for better or worse) roles of ideologies and myths.",323
Balancing Privacy and Information Disclosure in Interactive Record Linkage with Visual Masking,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657038,"effective use of data involving personal or sensitive information often requires different people to have access to personal information, which significantly reduces the personal privacy of those whose data is stored and increases risk of identity theft, data leaks, or social engineering attacks. our research studies the tradeoffs between privacy and utility of personal information for human decision making. using a record-linkage scenario, this paper presents a controlled study of how varying degrees of information availability influences the ability to effectively use personal information. we compared the quality of human decision-making using a visual interface that controls the amount of personal information available using visual markup to highlight data discrepancies. with this interface, study participants who viewed only 30% of data content had decision quality similar to those who had full 100% access. the results demonstrate that it is possible to greatly limit the amount of personal information available to human decision makers without negatively affecting utility or human effectiveness. however, the findings also show there is a limit to how much data can be hidden before negatively influencing the quality of judgment in decisions involving person-level data. despite the reduced accuracy with extreme data hiding, the study demonstrates that with proper interface designs, many correct decisions can be made with even legally de-identified data that is fully masked (74.5% accuracy with fully-masked data compared to 84.1% with full access). thus, when legal requirements only allow for de-identified data access, use of well-designed interface can significantly improve data utility. for legitimate data work such as data integration and verification using pii data, different people need to have access to personal information, which sacrifices the personal privacy of those whose data is stored. often, the primary methods for handling privacy concerns are either to restrict data access at the expense of data utility, or to open the data to more people to improve throughput and utility at the expense of reduced privacy. we study the use of data hiding and visual masking as a means of limiting the amount of pii available for human review while providing supplemental markup to help communicate essential properties needed for effective decision making. in a controlled experiment, we found evidence of tradeoffs between data restriction and decision quality. the results demonstrate that extreme limits to data disclosure can significantly reduce the quality of decision making. however, when legal requirements only allow for de-identified data access, use of an appropriate interface can significantly improve data utility, as participants achieved 74.5% accuracy with fullymasked data compared to 84.1% with unrestricted data access in the full condition. moreover, the results demonstrate that it is possible to significantly reduce pii disclosure without noticeably affecting decision accuracy. through the use of visual indicators of metadata and data discrepancies, participants who made data decisions while viewing only 30% of pii content had average decision quality similar to those who had full 100% access to the data. the findings of this work are important for understanding how to design privacy-preserving data systems for data workers.",324
Streets for People: Engaging Children in Placemaking Through a Socio-technical Process,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657039,"in this paper, we present a socio-technical process designed to engage children in an ongoing urban design project-streets for people-in newcastle, uk. we translated urban design proposals developed by residents and the local authority to enable children to contribute ideas to the project. our process comprised three stages: situated explorations and evidence gathering through digitally supported neighbourhood walks; issue mapping and peer-to-peer discussions using an online engagement platform; and face-to-face dialogue between children, residents, and the local authority through a 'town hall' event. we report insights gained through our engagement and show how our activities facilitated issue advocacy and the development of children's capacities, but also surfaced tensions around the agency of children in political processes. we reflect on the challenges of working in this space, and discuss wider implications for technology design and ethical questions that 'scaling up' such work might pose. this paper has reported several findings from a sociotechnical process developed to engage children in a ‘live’ urban design project. our study demonstrates the potential for hci to support the creation of further tools and processes to open up spaces for children’s participation in civic affairs. we suggest toolkits and ‘intergenerational’ platforms as two ways in which hci can support innovation in this area and create a more level playing field for children with respect to participation in placemaking processes. we suggest hci researchers can facilitate meaningful connections with civics by working with schools and within ‘live’ political processes such as streets for people. more research is needed to further explore how we can design processes that invite collaborations between children, local authorities and citizens in placemaking and that account for the tensions of opening intergenerational participatory spaces.",325
Vanishing Importance: Studying Immersive Effects of Game Audio Perception on Player Experiences in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657030,"sound and virtual reality (vr) are two important output modalities for creating an immersive player experience (px). while prior research suggests that sounds might contribute to a more immersive experience in games played on screens and mobile displays, there is not yet evidence of these effects of sound on px in vr. to address this, we conducted a within-subjects experiment using a commercial horror-adventure game to study the effects of a vr and monitor-display version of the same game on px. subsequently, we explored, in a between-subjects study, the effects of audio dimensionality on px in vr. results indicate that audio has a more implicit influence on px in vr because of the impact of the overall sensory experience and that audio dimensionality in vr may not be a significant factor contributing to px. based on our findings and observations, we provide five design guidelines for vr games. our studies in this paper addressed the lack of research on the effects of audio on immersive experiences in vr. we conducted two studies: (1) a within-subjects experiment with 12 participants using a commercial horror-adventure game to study the effects of vr and monitor-display versions of the same game on px. (2) a between-subjects study of 40 participants on the effects of audio dimensionality on px in vr. when comparing the hmd-vr condition to the monitordisplay condition, we found that audio played a less prominent role in vr and that participants were more preoccupied with their sensory experiences in vr. in the second study, subjectivity was found in the perceived importance of audio types. overall, our research has presented three important hci contributions: (1) we found that visual and aesthetic factors mattered more for participants in the hmd-vr condition, while, in the monitor-display condition, they were more concerned about the pursuit of in-game progression. (2) we found that audio dimensionality does not influence px in vr games. (3) we discussed five guidelines which emerged from our studies for developing and researching immersive vr experiences in games. this research presents an important step towards understanding effects of vr game audio on player experience.",326
Flexible Learning with Semantic Visual Exploration and Sequence-Based Recommendation of MOOC Videos,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657031,"massive open online course (mooc) platforms have scaled online education to unprecedented enrollments, but remain limited by their rigid, predetermined curricula. to overcome this limitation, this paper contributes a visual recommender system called moocex. the system recommends lecture videos across different courses by considering both video contents and sequential inter-topic relationships mined from course syllabi; and more importantly, it allows for interactive visual exploration of the semantic space of recommendations within a learner's current context. when compared to traditional methods (e.g., content-based recommendation and ranked list representations), moocex suggests videos from more diverse perspectives and helps learners make better video playback decisions. further, feedback from mooc learners and instructors indicates that the system enhances both learning and teaching effectiveness. we have presented moocex, an interactive tool that offers a flexible learning experience with dynamic recommendations and visual exploration of mooc videos. its recommendation engine considers sequential relationships between videos based on course syllabi, to ease the learning of concepts. also, its visual interface supports a richer semantic representation of videos in the information space, allowing learners to quickly make sense of the recommendations and decide their next step. three studies are conducted to evaluate different aspects of moocex by comparing it with traditional methods (i.e., content-based recommendation and ranked list), and the results indicate that moocex is effective and useful in various mooc learning scenarios. in the future, we plan to extend our recommendation engine to including more video features such as audio and image frames, and further enhance the visual interface. we also would like to experiment with recommending and exploring video subsegments, as well as non-mooc scenarios. finally, we aim to conduct a deployment study to collect real-world user data, thus further evaluating both the recommender algorithm and the visual interface of moocex.",327
“Trust Us”: Mobile Phone Use Patterns Can Predict Individual Trust Propensity,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657032,"an individual's trust propensity - i.e., a dispositional willingness to rely on others"" - mediates multiple socio-technical systems and has implications for their personal, and societal, well-being. hence, understanding and modeling an individual's trust propensity is important for human-centered computing research. conventional methods for understanding trust propensities have been surveys and lab experiments. we propose a new approach to model trust propensity based on long-term phone use metadata that aims to complement typical survey approaches with a lower-cost, faster, and scalable alternative. based on analysis of data from a 10-week field study (mobile phone logs) and ""ground truth"" survey involving 50 participants, we: (1) identify multiple associations between phone-based social behavior and trust propensity; (2) define a machine learning model that automatically infers a person's trust propensity. the results pave way for understanding trust at a societal scale and have implications for personalized applications in the emerging social internet of things. in this work, we have proposed a new approach to infer individual trust propensities using phone features as an alternative to conventional methods like surveys and lab experiments. using phone-based behavioral features allowed us to build predictive models by means of machine learning classification algorithms whose accuracy, auc, and f1 scores were promising and encouraging. to the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous study that analyzes the link between individual trust propensity and phone-based behavioral features. hence, these results pave way for more research on leveraging ubiquitous sensing data for understanding the interconnections between socio-mobile behavioral data and trust propensities. with further technical and ethical ground work, the proposed approach can be used for inferring trust propensities of individuals at a scale of billions of people. hence, with the growth in mobile phone penetration, the proposed approach could have multiple implications for individuals (e.g., customized apps) and societies as they engage in higher levels of technology-mediated interactions.",328
"“Suddenly, we got to become therapists for each other”: Designing Peer Support Chats for Mental Health",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657033,"talk therapy is a common, effective, and desirable form of mental health treatment. yet, it is inaccessible to many people. enabling peers to chat online using effective principles of talk therapy could help scale this form of mental health care. to understand how such chats could be designed, we conducted a two-week field experiment with 40 people experiencing mental illnesses comparing two types of online chats-chats guided by prompts, and unguided chats. results show that anxiety was significantly reduced from pre-test to post-test. user feedback revealed that guided chats provided solutions to problems and new perspectives, and were perceived as ""deep,"" while unguided chats offered personal connection on shared experiences and were experienced as ""smooth."" we contribute the design of an online guided chat tool and insights into the design of peer support chat systems that guide users to initiate, maintain, and reciprocate emotional support. in this paper, we designed an online guided chat tool with prompts based on psychotherapy skills and compared it to unguided chat. we found that guided and unguided chats reduced average symptoms of anxiety, but did so in qualitatively different ways. guided chats were perceived as deeply valuable for gaining solutions and insights, but provoked unwanted focus on troubles in some cases. unguided chats were experienced as smooth and easy-going, but tended toward distraction from troubles rather than emotional support. we hope that this work will motivate future digital peer interventions for mental health care.",329
Accountability in the Blue-Collar Data-Driven Workplace,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657034,"this paper examines how mobile technology impacts employee accountability in the blue-collar data-driven workplace. we conducted an observation-based qualitative study of how electricians in an electrical company interact with data related to their work accountability, which comprises the information employees feel is reasonable to share and document about their work. the electricians we studied capture data both manually, recording the hours spent on a particular task, and automatically, as their mobile devices regularly track data such as location. first, our results demonstrate how work accountability manifests for employees' manual labor work that has become data-driven. we show how employees work through moments of transparency, privacy, and accountability using data focused on location, identification and time. second, we demonstrate how this data production is interdependent with employees' beliefs about what is a reasonable level of detail and transparency to provide about their work. lastly, we articulate specific design implications related to work accountability. this paper examined data-driven work, focusing on how employees’ ability to generate high quality data in an electrical company becomes a mechanism for negotiating work accountability. here, work accountability refers to the level of detail and transparency that electricians provide about their work, using a crm system. in an observationbased study of the day-to-day data work of electricians in a mid-sized electrical company, we examined: how do employees negotiate work documentation on a day-to-day basis, and how is the level of tracking adjusted accordingly? first, we demonstrated how the production of quality data is interdependent with employees' understanding of how to negotiate the level of detail and transparency about their work. as such, when electricians lack the skill to navigate how and when they provide data about their work, it is practically impossible to develop a good understanding of use and non-use, including a consistent practice around the use of crm and acceptable workarounds. despite the obvious risk of inconsistencies in automatic data generation, we find that middle managers are by design presented with data analysis on time approval sheets, and in some cases make use of it. from this perspective, skill matters both in terms of electricians’, ceos’, and middle managers’ understanding of how data from tracking are produced, and how this data may be incomplete due to an ‘flexible’ incomplete practice. skill, in other words, is a requirement for a boundary regulation process of the use of data from tracking, and cannot be assumed for any party involved. avoiding the risk of increased tracking requires that electricians are able to conduct relevant workarounds to operate the crm system, and thus also to be compliant by meeting the request for documentation in the crm. secondly, we reflect on how data about work becomes a mechanism for negotiating work accountability. accountability, we find, is based on some negotiation capacity, even if employees cannot exactly manipulate the crm to achieve their desired level of transparency. the backwards tracing of responsibility that is embedded in the design of the crm system does not take into account that most work in the electrical company is collaborative in practice. this is especially true for work carried out in the larger construction sites. when electricians understand how and when their manual data entries can be combined with automatically generated data, they can effectively negotiate work accountability, meaning in this case the level of detail and transparency they provide about their work. however, the company as a whole also benefits when electricians know how to maneuver in the crm system, since this is the basis for how the company demonstrates accountability to customers and legal authorities. thus, we demonstrate in the paper how work accountability manifests for manual labor employees’ work as they themselves and the company rely on crm documentation in the case of, for example, a customer complaint. lastly, we offer specific design implications related to work accountability. data and design implications the design implications of our findings reflect how the dayto-day use of crm is socially embedded; thus, the functioning of crm, including the documentation of work, depends on employees’ motivation to produce high-quality data, which is generally true for work tracking. it is important that employees have equal access and opportunity to develop the skills to operate as data-workers, our findings suggest: 1) because the crm is currently based on the tracking and documentation of individual employees – whereas work in a construction site is mainly collaborative – the scale and steps for a company to use and scrutinize the data should be clear to employees for them to stay motivated as producers of high-quality data. 2) the crm supports data that can be aggregated and moved upstream; however, it is crucial in this process that any change made to data (for example, the invoice to clients every half hour – whereas employees check-in and check-out on the exact time) is transparent to employees and can be accounted for by the company. 3) support and training is equally important to provide both management and employees with opportunities for the reflection and skill development needed to transition to datadriven work.",330
Food Democracy in the Making: Designing with Local Food Networks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657045,"this paper introduces the concept of 'food democracy' as a theoretical framing for hci to engage in human-food interaction. extending existing foci of health and environmental sustainability, food democracy requires thinking through aspects of social and economic justice, and democratic governance as directions for the study and design of technologies for alternative food movements. to exemplify food democracy, we report on field observations and interviews about the opportunities and challenges for supporting the development of local food networks with communities in deprived neighbourhoods using an online direct food marketing platform. using a food democracy framing, we identify tensions around environmental, social, and economic goals; challenges of local food businesses operating within the existing economic paradigm; and differing perspectives on ownership and governance in the network. we discuss the need for hci to design for systems change and propose a design space for hci in supporting food democracy movements. this paper introduced food democracy as a useful theoretical framing for both understanding of and designing with local food networks. the proposed theoretical lens broadens hci’s engagement with food beyond health and environmental sustainability and helps to engage with questions of social and economic justice and democratic governance of our food system. through empirical analysis of our engagements with a variety of actors and organisations, this paper begun to explore some of the concrete challenges organisations face in developing a collaborative network for local food that aim at changing the underlying system. digital platforms, like the open food network, can support local food networks by managing order processes and aggregating demand. while such technology can increase efficiency, our findings show how locally produced food can remain inaccessible for deprived communities. we highlighted tensions between ambitions of our partners in realising ideas and values aligning with food democracy and the affordability of food. this is largely due to the fact that ethical practise still has to operate within the existing system of neoliberal market economics. collaboration across organisations and community development to achieve a system change, faces significant hurdles. discussions and proposals remained largely within the neoliberalist and modernist logic. we argue therefore for hci to engage in design of technology and models of civic food networks that moves beyond the transactional interactions between ‘consumers’ and ‘producers’ towards food citizenship. we discuss that this change needs to happen through incremental changes within the current system that in the long run question the condition of the market as a ‘natural’ fact and realise alternative models. in particular, in designing with local food networks, we discuss a research and design agenda for hci that follows the six principles of social justice within a food democracy framing. finally, we conclude with a call for hci to support sharing of and learning from success stories internationally.",331
Better Understanding of Foot Gestures: An Elicitation Study,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657046,"we present a study aimed to better understand users' perceptions of foot gestures employed on a horizontal surface. we applied a user elicitation methodology, in which participants were asked to suggest foot gestures to actions (referents) in three conditions: standing up in front of a large display, sitting down in front of a desktop display, and standing on a projected surface. based on majority count and agreement scores, we identified three gesture sets, one for each condition. each gesture set shows a mapping between a common action and its chosen gesture. as a further contribution, we suggest a new measure called specification score, which indicates the degree to which a gesture is specific, preferable and intuitive to an action in a specific condition of use. finally, we present measurable insights that can be implemented as guidelines for future development and research of foot interaction. the current work presented a three-part user elicitation study of foot gestures. the main contribution of this work is the elicitation of three user-defined foot gestures sets. in addition, we introduced and demonstrated the use of a new measure called specification score, which indicates how specific a gesture is to an action. this can help understand which gestures are preferable, intuitive, or most suitable to use in a specific condition. finally, we listed several measurable insights and observations regarding the preferable and intuitive use of foot gestures, and discussed various foot gesture properties. the provided gesture sets, as well as the presented insights and observations, can be used as guidelines for developers and researchers when designing future foot-based interactive systems.",332
InfoNice: Easy Creation of Information Graphics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657047,"information graphics are widely used to convey messages and present insights in data effectively. however, creating expressive data-driven infographics remains a great challenge for general users without design expertise. we present infonice, a visualization design tool that enables users to easily create data-driven infographics. infonice allows users to convert unembellished charts into infographics with multiple visual elements through mark customization. we implement infonice into microsoft power bi to demonstrate the integration of infonice into data analysis workflow seamlessly, bridging the gap between data exploration and presentation. we evaluate the usability and usefulness of infonice through example infographics, an in-lab user study, and real-world user feedback. our results show that infonice enables users to create a variety of infographics easily for common scenarios. in this paper, we introduced infonice, an authoring tool for designing infographic-style data visualizations. infonice allows users to follow an integrated workflow of data exploration, data visualization, and visualization embellishments, hence lowering the barrier to create engaging infographic design and bridging the gap between data exploration and presentation. through flexible data binding options, users can easily bind data with visual elements and combine them together to create infographic designs. we demonstrated the expressiveness through example graphics and conducted a user study and a real user survey to understand the use of infonice. in the future, we will continue releasing new versions and provide more functions to facilitate users’ design of infographics.",333
Metamaterial Textures,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657048,"we present metamaterial textures---3d printed surface geometries that can perform a controlled transition between two or more textures. metamaterial textures are integrated into 3d printed objects and allow designing how the object interacts with the environment and the user's tactile sense. inspired by foldable paper sheets (""origami"") and surface wrinkling, our 3d printed metamaterial textures consist of a grid of cells that fold when compressed by an external global force. unlike origami, however, metamaterial textures offer full control over the transformation, such as in between states and sequence of actuation. this allows for integrating multiple textures and makes them useful, e.g., for exploring parameters in the rapid prototyping of textures. metamaterial textures are also robust enough to allow the resulting objects to be grasped, pushed, or stood on. this allows us to make objects, such as a shoe sole that transforms from flat to treaded, a textured door handle that provides tactile feedback to visually impaired users, and a configurable bicycle grip. we present an editor assists users in creating metamaterial textures interactively by arranging cells, applying forces, and previewing their deformation. we proposed an approach that leverages metamaterials to create transformable textures on 3d printed objects. we demonstrated the benefits of our approach in three objects and provided an interactive editor to allow researchers and users to create novel textures. we see metamaterial textures as a first step to integrate transforming textures into 3d printed objects. in the long run, we think such an approach might be relevant to disseminate more expressive haptics in everyday objects. we hope this opens new dialogs between ux and product designers and results in novel everyday objects with multiple pre-integrated textures that can be activated by the end user.",334
A Case for Design Localization: Diversity of Website Aesthetics in 44 Countries,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657049,"adapting the visual designs of websites to a local target audience can be beneficial, because such design localization increases users' appeal, trust, and work efficiency. yet designers often find it difficult to decide when to adapt and how to adapt the designs, mainly because there are currently no guidelines that describe common website designs in various countries. we contribute the first large-scale analysis of 80,901 website designs across 44 countries, made available via an interactive web-based design catalog. using computational image metrics to compare the ~2,000 most visited websites per country, we found significant differences between several design aspects, such as a website's colorfulness, visual complexity, the number of text areas and the average saturation of colors. our results contribute a snapshot of web designs that users in 44 countries frequently see, showing that the design of websites with a global reach are more homogenized compared to local websites between countries. we contributed a large-scale analysis of current website designs in 44 countries. our results demonstrate that website designs significantly differ between countries, and that these differences are predominantly driven by variations in the designs of local websites. in contrast, global websites that are popular in a number of different countries often do not localize their designs. our work allows designers to determine whether to adapt their website to another country and how to do that. in order to support these decisions, we provided findings that suggest when it is worthwhile adapting (e.g., to appear more “local” in a given country), a dataset that includes tangible image metrics that can serve as design guidelines, and a tool that allows visually comparing websites from our 44 countries. these guidelines, orchestrated with other important website localization aspects, like translation, content, image composition, color interpretation, and symbols, will point designers into the direction of successful solutions. our contributions will help designers engage with target audiences across the world, and adapt in an ever changing online ecosystem of local and global aesthetics.",335
As We May Study: Towards the Web as a Personalized Language Textbook,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657040,"we present a system designed to enable learners of a foreign language to read materials that are personally interesting to them from the web and practice vocabulary with interactive exercises based on their past readings. we report on the results of deploying the system for one month with three classes of dutch highschool students learning french. the students and their teacher were positive about the system and in particular about the personalization aspects that the system enables. we presented a system aimed to be a minimal viable product for a personalized language textbook that uses the web as its content source. we deployed the system with sixty high school students for one month. based on telemetry we see that students take advantage of the possibility of personalization by reading articles that are interesting and by practicing words in exercises generated from their past readings. based on their interactions we can see that their vocabulary is enriched with new words and the knowledge of other words is strengthened. in their feedback, the students appreciate the possibility of reading personally relevant texts and the ease of interaction with the texts that is provided by the reader component of our system. however, they also want better ways to find personally relevant content. the teacher of the three classes thinks that such a system is critical for the modern classroom, but wants more detailed data about student activity within the system. as future work we see two salient directions. first, more work with teachers is needed to better understand how to combine the individual focus of personalized textbook with the collective experience of the learners in a classroom. second, improved content recommenders and difficulty estimators are needed in order to provide an even better personalization of content and thus increase learner interest and motivation.",336
KnobSlider: Design of a Shape-Changing UI for Parameter Control,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657041,"physical controls are widely used by professionals such as sound engineers or aircraft pilots. in particular knobs and sliders are the most prevalent in such interfaces. they have advantages over touchscreen guis, especially when users require quick and eyes-free control. however, their interfaces (e.g., mixing consoles) are often bulky and crowded. to improve this, we present the results of a formative study with professionals who use physical controllers. based on their feedback, we propose design requirements for future interfaces for parameters control. we then introduce the design of our knobslider that combines the advantages of a knob and a slider in one unique shape-changing device. a qualitative study with professionals shows how knobslider supports the design requirements, and inspired new interactions and applications. in this paper, we identified six requirements for a physical interface for flexible continuous parameters control. based on these requirements, we designed a working prototype, knobslider. it combines the benefits of a physical knob and a physical slider through on-demand shape change. we evaluated the knobslider with target users. results suggested future improvements of the knobslider and implications for shape-changing interfaces. in future work, we will iterate the design so that we can conduct a longterm field study with professionals. we will also explore novel interaction techniques based on this device.",337
BreathVR: Leveraging Breathing as a Directly Controlled Interface for Virtual Reality Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657042,"with virtual reality head-mounted displays rapidly becoming accessible to mass audiences, there is growing interest in new forms of natural input techniques to enhance immersion and engagement for players. research has explored physiological input for enhancing immersion in single player games through indirectly controlled signals like heart rate or galvanic skin response. in this paper, we propose breathing as a directly controlled physiological signal that can facilitate unique and engaging play experiences through natural interaction in single and multiplayer virtual reality games. our study (n = 16) shows that participants report a higher sense of presence and find the gameplay more fun and challenging when using our breathing actions. from study observations and analysis we present five design strategies that can aid virtual reality game designers interested in using directly controlled forms of physiological input. in this work we presented breathing as a directly controlled input technique for vr games. we designed and implemented four breathing actions and two game experiences that explore different natural mappings of the actions to effects in the virtual world. analysis of results from a study with 16 participants provided us with more insights into the pros and cons of using breathing actions. we further identified six design strategies for vr game designers interested in adding breathing actions to their games. as vr becomes broadly accepted and new forms of input emerge, we need to consider player needs to balance interaction using traditional input methods like keyboards or controllers with newer immersive physiological inputs.",338
Choosing to Help Monsters: A Mixed-Method Examination of Meaningful Choices in Narrative-Rich Games and Interactive Narratives,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657043,"the potential of narrative-rich games to impact emotions, attitudes, and behavior brings with it exciting opportunities and implications within both entertainment and serious game contexts. however, effects are not always consistent, potentially due to game choices not always being perceived as meaningful by the players. to examine these perceptual variations, we used a mixed-method approach. a qualitative study first investigated meaningful game choices from the players' perspectives. building on the themes developed in this first study, a quantitative study experimentally examined the effect of meaningful game choices on player experiences of appreciation, enjoyment, and narrative engagement. results highlight the importance of moral, social, and consequential characteristics in creating meaningful game choices, which positively affected appreciation. meaningfulness of game choices may therefore be crucial for narrative-rich games and interactive narratives to impact players. using a mixed-methods approach, meaningful choices in narrative-rich games and their impact on the effect of making a choice on appreciation in narrative-rich games were examined through two studies. the results of the qualitative study 1 revealed meaningful choices in participants’ accounts to be defined by the presence of social and moral characteristics and a belief that their choices impacted the resulting immediate consequences. the results of the quantitative experimental study 2 found the presence of these mechanics to significantly impact appreciation as the experience of meaningfulness, thereby validating the findings of study 1. furthermore, the finding that making a choice had an effect on appreciation only for the high-meaningful choice condition supports the argument that adding a choice as a form of narrative interactivity is not a silver bullet, but may only be effective when the choices the player can make are perceived as meaningful.",339
Support for Social and Cultural Capital Development in Real-time Ridesharing Services,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657044,"today's transportation systems and technologies have the potential to transform the ways individuals acquire resources from their social networks and environments. however, it is unclear what types of resources can be acquired and how technology could support these efforts. we address this gap by investigating these questions in the domain of real-time ridesharing systems. we present insights from two qualitative studies: (1) a set of semi-structured interviews with 13 uber drivers and (2) a set of semi-structured interviews with 13 uber riders. our results show that both drivers and riders acquired and benefited from informational, emotional and instrumental resources, as well as cultural exchanges via interactions with each other and with online platforms. we argue that these interactions could support the development of social and cultural capital. we discuss our findings in the context of labor and contribute design implications for in-car social and cultural experiences and for the ways technologies such as gps and location-based services can support the additional emotional, social, and cultural labor that drivers provide to their riders. we took a user-centered approach to identify opportunities for technology to incorporate support for and enhance driver-rider interaction. we contribute results from two qualitative studies of drivers and riders to understand opportunities for technology to foster the development of social and cultural capital in the context of real-time ridesharing systems. our findings show that both drivers and riders gained informational, emotional, and instrumental resources, and companionship by being part of the real-time ridesharing ecosystem. our contributions suggest future research opportunities to explore. for example, there are open opportunities to facilitate drivers’ support of other drivers. moreover, both riders and drivers valued and mutually benefited from the cultural exchanges, suggesting that there are opportunities to grow cultural capital within the ridesharing ecosystem. while we conclude based on the interactions that there are opportunities for the growth of social and cultural capital in the case of ridesharing, the acquisition of social and cultural capital is itself contingent on several individual and community characteristics. ethnicity, socio-economic backgrounds, and educational attainment [41] are some factors that determine whether individuals can take advantage of and benefit from these opportunities. examining how these factors played into the opportunities created and whether and how they were turned into something beneficial by drivers and riders is a potential next step for our research. our results also suggest opportunities for future research to explore ways to acknowledge drivers’ additional labor. are there ways in which systems could acknowledge drivers’ additional labor to extend in offline contexts? could on-demand platforms be integrated with openbadges2 to show the skills drivers demonstrated? while facilitating support for drivers is crucial to enhancing real-time ridesharing systems, it is important to consider the future of the ecosystem. for example, autonomous vehicles equipped with driver assistance will change the nature of driver roles and their function within ridesharing services. the potential loss of this stakeholder in the ecosystem must also be taken into consideration. drivers are central to the opportunities that exist for riders’ acquisition of social and cultural capital. how might this loss affect the modified driver roles?",340
Are You Dreaming?: A Phenomenological Study on Understanding Lucid Dreams as a Tool for Introspection in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657155,"virtual reality (vr) is resurging in popularity with the advancement of low-cost hardware and more realistic graphics. how might this technology help others? that is, to increase mental well-being? the ultimate vr might look like lucid dreaming, the phenomenon of knowing one is dreaming while in the dream. lucid dreaming can be used as an introspective tool and, ultimately, increase mental well-being. what these introspective experiences are like for lucid dreamers might be key in determining specific design guidelines for future creation of a technological tool used for helping people examine their own thoughts and emotions. this study describes nine active and proficient lucid dreamers' representations of their introspective experiences gained through phenomenological interviews. four major themes emerged: sensations and feelings, actions and practices, influences on experience, and meaning making. this knowledge can help design a vr system that is grounded in genuine experience and preserving the human condition. virtual reality could be the platform that allows its users to explore introspection and have a positive impact on wellbeing because of its potential to provide an immersive space that feels real despite its user knowing it is not. a completely immersive vr experience draws may parallels to a real life “virtual” phenomenon people already experience, namely lucid dreaming. by using qualitative research methods to study introspection in lucid dreaming, we described the essence of this phenomenon as well as the context in which it occurs. the descriptions generated were used to develop design considerations for an immersive virtual reality system that will be used as a tool for introspection. from preliminary findings, there are four themes: sensations and feelings, actions and practices, influences on experience, and meaning making. overall, it seems like lucid dreaming can be used as an effective tool for introspection and can be helpful as a new lens in which to look through in designing for introspective virtual reality experiences.",341
A Large-Scale Study of iPhone App Launch Behaviour,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657156,"there have been many large-scale investigations of users' mobile app launch behaviour, but all have been conducted on android, even though recent reports suggest iphones account for a third of all smartphones in use. we report on the first large-scale analysis of app usage patterns on iphones. we conduct a reproduction study with a cohort of over 10,000 jailbroken iphone users, reproducing several studies previously conducted on android devices. we find some differences, but also significant similarities: e.g. communications apps are the most used on both platforms; similar patterns are apparent of few apps being very popular but there existing a 'long tail' of many apps used by the population; users show similar patterns of 'micro-usage'; almost identical proportions of people use a unique combination of apps. such similarities add confidence but also specificity about claims of consistency across smartphones. as well as presenting our findings, we discuss issues involved in reproducing studies across platforms. study reproduction is a valuable practice in hci. not every piece of research can consider all groups of users or study a phenomenon over many years, so each study is likely limited to considering a relatively small number of users at one time. for the field to keep learning, it is necessary to determine whether results still hold, among different subpopulations, or as environments evolve. we have attempted to reproduce previous studies on the use of android, hoping to gain a general sense of whether findings would also generalise to our users, and the extent to which such comparisons were even possible. we collect data from jailbroken ios users, who form an interesting cohort in itself, but we do not claim our findings would generalise to all ios users. we present our findings based around 3 hypotheses. we found evidence to support h1, our hypothesis that users would behave very similarly across platforms among strongly observed trends such as apps for communication being the most used on both platforms, proportionately highest in the afternoon and evening; most apps being used by a small proportion of users, and only few apps used highly frequently; over 99% of users differentiable by their app signatures over a 45 day period, and micro-usage behaviour being within variation spreads already seen [13]. we found a more mixed message in examining h2, where we assessed whether the jailbroken ios users would be more intense device users and be regular eager experimenters with new apps. our users did use apps for longer, across most categories, and they combined more apps into their usage sessions, but on average they used a smaller set of apps over 45 days than users in the previous android study, our third hypothesis was quite strongly refuted by our data – there is not a lesser degree of overlap in the used apps of our users, and welke et al.’s results hold across platforms. for many trends, therefore, it seems that even though we have recruited users on a different platform, from a specific subpopulation, there is a high degree of similarity in usage, and we can be more confident in claiming that these patterns are consistent across smartphones in general. however, our reproduced studies have uncovered enough distinct behaviour to suggest that there is heterogeneity of use across platforms. having identified which areas show distinct usage patterns, we also offer a challenge for future work: to further explore these, possibly through qualitative methods, to ascertain why results appear as they do. moreover, we propose that, in designing for future generations of smartphones, it is not sufficient to constantly draw implications from the same platform-specific subset of users. we also discuss challenges encountered in our (and other) comparison studies. the two platforms under consideration share enough in terms of fundamental design that we could simply compare broad concepts such as counts of apps or usage durations. more difficulties arose in terms of specific app availability, categorisation, sample matching, data logging intricacies or varying ethical practices across institutions. however, many of these issues are not unique to cross-platform studies, and could arise in any attempts to re-examine previously published results. we propose a number of responses to such challenges, some technical (e.g. developing standardised frameworks for experimental recruitment, and for data representation and processing) and some practical (e.g. more continuous and communal approaches to such experimentation). we hope to contribute, along with others, to such future developments.",342
Physical Keyboards in Virtual Reality: Analysis of Typing Performance and Effects of Avatar Hands,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657157,"entering text is one of the most common tasks when interacting with computing systems. virtual reality (vr) presents a challenge as neither the user's hands nor the physical input devices are directly visible. hence, conventional desktop peripherals are very slow, imprecise, and cumbersome. we developed a apparatus that tracks the user's hands, and a physical keyboard, and visualize them in vr. in a text input study with 32 participants, we investigated the achievable text entry speed and the effect of hand representations and transparency on typing performance, workload, and presence. with our apparatus, experienced typists benefited from seeing their hands, and reach almost outside-vr performance. inexperienced typists profited from semi-transparent hands, which enabled them to type just 5.6 wpm slower than with a regular desktop setup. we conclude that optimizing the visualization of hands in vr is important, especially for inexperienced typists, to enable a high typing performance. consumer virtual reality is still in the fledgling stages and mainly targets entertainment use cases. we have shown the potential of vr for a wide variety of use cases by enabling natural generic text input on a physical keyboard while being immersed in a virtual environment. our apparatus comprises a calibration free, low latency, and accurate finger tracking with a state of the art head mounted display. thus we can create virtual environments allowing for effortless typing in vr. we conducted a text input study with a total of 32 typists of different skill levels and tested their typing performance based on various hand representations and transparency in a virtual environment. in the study, we found no significant difference in typing speed for the experienced typists using avatar hands. inexperienced typists require hand visualizations to orient themselves in vr while transparency has no effects. they were just 5.6 wpm slower in vr using transparent realistic hands. further, results show that all typists benefit from seeing a representation of their hands during non-contiguous typing. results show that experienced typists are less affected by different hand rendering. for all typists, realistic hands rendering are in favor to generates the highest presence with the lowest workload. a new combination of mobile hmds, advanced finger trackers and a keyboard could allow us to have a truly mobile office. for the future, we envision working in well-known but highly flexible virtual environments completely independent of where we are physically located.",343
“Bursting the Assistance Bubble”: Designing Inclusive Technology with Children with Mixed Visual Abilities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657158,"children living with visual impairments (vis) are increasingly educated in mainstream rather than special schools. but knowledge about the challenges they face in inclusive schooling environments and how to design technology to overcome them remains scarce. we report findings from a field study involving interviews and observations of educators and children with/without vis in mainstream schools, in which we identified the ""teaching assistant bubble"" as a potential barrier to group learning, social play and independent mobility. we present co-design activities blending elements of future workshops, multisensory crafting, fictional inquiry and bodystorming, demonstrating that children with and without vis can jointly lead design processes and explore design spaces reflective of mixed visual abilities and shared experiences. we extend previous research by characterising challenges and opportunities for improving inclusive education of children with vis in mainstream schools, in terms of balancing assistance and independence, and reflect on the process and outcomes of co-designing with mixed-ability groups in this context. we interviewed and observed educators and children living with visual impairments in mainstream schools in order to identify challenges facing inclusion and areas that lend themselves to effective technological intervention. our field study presents rich descriptions of how existing educational and social support structures could lead to “teaching assistance bubbles” with undesirable effects on group learning, social play and independent mobility. as schools move towards more technology in the classroom, technological support for children with special educational needs should move beyond accessibility concerns to consider effective support for inclusive interactions. we suggested areas where technology could more usefully intervene to promote inclusion by characterising the subtle balance between accessibility and independence in terms of bridging space, language, and material disconnects. our adaptations of co-designing methods for children with mixed visual abilities demonstrate the effectiveness of opening up novel design spaces and producing conceptual designs for technology that can accommodate and augment the varied abilities present in inclusive schooling environments.",344
Review of Intrinsic Motivation in Simulation-based Game Testing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657159,"this paper presents a review of intrinsic motivation in player modeling, with a focus on simulation-based game testing. modern ai agents can learn to win many games; from a game testing perspective, a remaining research problem is how to model the aspects of human player behavior not explained by purely rational and goal-driven decision making. a major piece of this puzzle is constituted by intrinsic motivations, i.e., psychological needs that drive behavior without extrinsic reinforcement such as game score. we first review the common intrinsic motivations discussed in player psychology research and artificial intelligence, and then proceed to systematically review how the various motivations have been implemented in simulated player agents. our work reveals that although motivations such as competence and curiosity have been studied in ai, work on utilizing them in simulation-based game testing is sparse, and other motivations such as social relatedness, immersion, and domination appear particularly underexplored. we have overviewed the common intrinsic motivations and psychological needs discussed in the literature on motivation and games. subsequently, we have reviewed how these motivations have been implemented in intelligent agents. a primary strategy is to have an intrinsic motivation module that translates the agent’s observations and extrinsic rewards into intrinsic rewards, which the agent then attempts to maximize. in effect, such an intrinsic motivation module usually implements emotions through one or more computational appraisals such as an evaluation of the predictability of the reward. the appraisals are then combined and encoded in the intrinsic reinforcement signal; in essence, this means that positive emotions are treated as intrinsic rewards, and negative emotions are treated as punishment that the agents avoid. of the common intrinsic motivations – competence, autonomy, social relatedness, curiosity, immersion, domination – curiosity appears to be the most often utilized one both in general ai and game-playing agents, implemented through appraisals of unpredictability of the rewards or observations. together with the need for competence and challenges, curiosity helps both real organisms and simulated agents explore and learn even if the extrinsic rewards are rare or otherwise do not provide strong guidance. another common computational appraisal is information-theoretic empowerment, denoting the magnitude of change the agent can have in its sensory inputs through its actions. empowerment has been suggested to be related to both competence and autonomy [24], and it may also be linked to the domination motivations identified in games, as being able to dominate others enables new degrees of freedom for controlling a social environment. work on social relatedness and in particular immersion and domination is sparse, with only a few examples. in general, despite the prevalence of the term ""intrinsic motivation"", intrinsically motivated ai seems to in practice focus more on appraisal theories of emotion than intrinsic motivation theories such as self-determination theory. this is understandable, as appraisal theory provides more clear concepts that can be implemented as ai code, although it might be less well known in the game research community than player type research or self-determination theory. in the domain of player modeling, research has utilized both explicit motivation models based on computational appraisals, and implicit models learned from player data. explicit models appear less prevalent; in the end, we found surprisingly few papers to include in this review. what also appears to be missing is a combination of both approaches: explicit models validated and fine-tuned based on real player data. we believe that such models have the potential to provide both the high accuracy of data-driven models and high versatility and generalization capabilities of data-free models. explicit computational appraisals also have the benefit of acting both as behavior drivers and as measures of the agent’s affective state. thus, they could be used for both testing for player behavior and player experience, which could perhaps be combined with or substituted for the expressive but labor-intensive physiological player experience research methods such as biometric storyboards [56]. to enable developing and validating better computational models of motivation and emotion, closer collaboration of ai and player experience researchers is called for, with the goal of compiling rich datasets and benchmarks. such datasets should include time-stamped data streams with enough temporal resolution, e.g., gameplay videos, game event logs, and affect signals such as galvanic skin response, heart-rate variability, and player facial expressions. further, the datasets should be collected from games that allow the integration of custom ai agents, e.g., through the openai gym interface [12]. to the best of our knowledge, no current publicly available dataset satisfies all the criteria.",345

An Eye For Design: Gaze Visualizations for Remote Collaborative Work,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657151,"in remote collaboration, gaze visualizations are designed to display where collaborators are looking in a shared visual space. this type of gaze-based intervention can improve coordination, however researchers have yet to fully explore different gaze visualization techniques and develop a deeper understanding of the ways in which features of visualizations may interact with task attributes to influence collaborative performance. there are many ways to visualize characteristics of eye movements, such as a path connecting fixation points or a heat map illustrating fixation duration and coverage. in this study, we designed and evaluated three unique gaze visualizations in a remote search task. our results suggest that the design of gaze visualizations affects performance, coordination, searching behavior, and perceived utility. additionally, the degree of task coupling further influences the effect of gaze visualizations on performance and coordination. we then reflect on the value of gaze visualizations for remote work and discuss implications for the design of gaze-based interventions. in this work, we evaluated three unique gaze visualizations across the same visual search task with varying degrees of task coupling. the results of this study demonstrated that the design of gaze visualizations play a critical role in how they are used to support coordination. furthermore, the properties of the task determined how the gaze visualizations impact attention. we have identified availability of the visualization and amount of information displayed as important features of visualizations that influence how pairs allocate attention and coordinate with each other. the properties of the task can determine which features are most appropriate to support effective collaboration. as remote collaboration continues to grow in popularity and find new applications it is important to consider the role of non-verbal cues in facilitating communication. gaze visualizations can be an effective tool for enhancing communication in a variety of contexts. a broader understanding of the features of gaze visualizations can help designers adapt to new contexts quickly and effectively use gaze visualizations to support specific task goals.",347
Assisting Students with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities in Inclusive Education with Smartwatches,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657152,"smartwatches have a large potential to support everyday activities. however, their potential as assistive technologies in inclusive academic environments is unclear. to investigate how smartwatches can support students with intellectual and developmental disabilities (idds) to perform activities that require emotional and behavioral skills and involve communication, collaboration and planning, we implemented weli. weli (wearable life) is a wearable application designed to assist young adults with idds attending a postsecondary education program. this paper reports on the user-centric design process adopted in the development of weli, and describes how smartwatches can assist students with idds in special education. the results reported are drawn from 8 user studies with 58 participants in total. weli features include behavioral intervention, mood regulation, reminders, checklists, surveys and rewards. results indicate that several considerations must be taken into account when designing for students with idd, and that overall the students are enthusiastic about adopting an innovative smartwatch application in class, as they reacted positively about the technology and features provided. to assist young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (idds) and help them to become more independent and engaged in a post-secondary inclusive program, we designed and developed weli. weli is available for android smartphones and android smartwatches, serving as a complementary tool for assistants who send wearable notifications to the students using a mobile application. the features provided include reminders for focus, silence, participation, rewards, countdown, checklist, survey and self-assessment. the application requirements were elicited and refined through eight user studies conducted with students with idds, their assistants and experts in special education. by providing help to the students and facilitating the work of the assistants, weli enables students to depend less on the assistants in class, improving their self-confidence. the results of our usability study reveal that designing for students with idds require special considerations to accommodate their needs, but also that students are excited about using novel wearable technologies in class to assist them. in addition to that weli requires no training for the students to learn how to interact with the watch. all the features provided by weli received positive feedback, particularly the rewards feature. as future work, we will conduct long-term field studies involving students and assistants to better assess how weli impacts their daily routines in inclusive classes, to gather additional feedback about the application. we will also add features to help the students with idds to give a presentation in class and to help the assistants to take notes. further customization options will be added for personalization. moreover, we will explore the use of the watch sensors to provide smart and automated support, for instance to suggest breaks for the students when they are feeling sleepy in class. finally, we plan to extend weli to cover activities outside of the class.",348
Making as Expression: Informing Design with People with Complex Communication Needs through Art Therapy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657153,"there is a growing emphasis on designing with people with diverse health experiences rather than designing for them. yet, collaborative design becomes difficult when working with individuals with health conditions (e.g., stroke, cancer, abuse, depression) that affect their ability or willingness to engage alongside researchers and verbally express themselves. the present paper analyzes how the clinical practice of art therapy engages these individuals in co-creative, visual expression of ideas, thoughts, and experiences. drawing on interviews with 22 art therapists and over two years of field work in a clinical setting, we detail how art therapists view making as expression for people with complex communication needs. under this view, we argue that art therapy practice can inspire collaborative design engagements by understanding materials as language, creating space for expression, and sustaining expressions in a broader context. we discuss practical and ethical implications for design work involving individuals with complex communication needs. there is a growing interest in involving individuals with complex communication needs in design work, particularly around the creation and use of new technologies. current strategies for engaging these individuals often focus on bridging gaps in communication left by an impairment or stigmatizing experience. at times, we narrowly scope and limit the conversational space so that we, as researchers, can understand. we argue that art therapy provides a model for how the research community can view making as expression and shift the terms of communication to understand what is most important to participants and points of connection for future design work. further, art therapy provides a lens on the privileged position of verbal discourse in collaborative design work and opens up new avenues for fostering supportive and experience affirming co-creative design engagements.",349
The Unexpected Entry and Exodus of Women in Computing and HCI in India,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657154,"in india, women represent 45% of total computer science enrollment in universities, almost three times the rate in the united states, where it is 17%. at the same time, women make up an estimated 25-30% of the hci community in india, half the rate in the u.s. we investigate the complexities of these surprising phenomena through qualitative research of indian computer science and human-computer interaction researchers and professionals at various life stages. we find among other things that indian familial norms play a significant role in pressuring young women into computing as a field; that familial pressures and workplace discrimination then cause a precipitous exit of women from computing at the onset of marriage; and that hci occupies an interstitial space between art and technology that affects women's careers. our findings underscore the societal influence on women's representation in the tech sector and invite further participation by the hci community in related questions. we presented the gender-related complexities that indian women face in computing and hci throughout their life time, drawing from qualitative research with indian researchers, practitioners, and students. against a backdrop of entrenched gender discrimination and relatively low literacy rates, india provides a interesting case study of women in computing. cultural and economic expectations around working in the software industry forged supportive environments for women in the undergraduate and master’s levels (45% women in undergraduate cs programs); but swiftly devolved into discrimination and eventual exit from ph.d., academia, and it jobs (where women constitute 80% of entry-level jobs). specifically, societal stigma against highly qualified women, limited female role models for the family, unfriendly work policies, and delayed promotions affect professional progress. hci suffers from the converse effect—in viewing hci education as arts-centric, the field was viewed as less desirable to enter the it force (only an estimated 25-30% women in hci programs). over and above the perception, women were discriminated in the core aspects of hci research, such as fieldwork, brainstorming, and design critiques. future work could extend inquiry to lower-tier colleges, other gender-inequal countries, and include parents and partners of women. we hope that by bringing attention to the societal influence on women’s education and careers, we can move towards more equitable computing and hci for all.",350
ProtoAR: Rapid Physical-Digital Prototyping of Mobile Augmented Reality Applications,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657165,"the latest generations of smartphones with built-in ar capabilities enable a new class of mobile apps that merge digital and real-world content depending on a user's task, context, and preference. but even experienced mobile app designers face significant challenges: creating 2d/3d ar content remains difficult and time-consuming, and current mobile prototyping tools do not support ar views. there are separate tools for this; however, they require significant technical skill. this paper presents protoar which supplements rapid physical prototyping using paper and play-doh with new mobile cross-device multi-layer authoring and interactive capture tools to generate mobile screens and ar overlays from paper sketches, and quasi-3d content from 360-degree captures of clay models. we describe how protoar evolved over four design jams with students to enable interactive prototypes of mobile ar apps in less than 90 minutes, and discuss the advantages and insights protoar can give designers. this paper presents a new augmented reality (ar) tool, protoar, specifically designed with interaction designers in mind. protoar comes with a visual editor that composes ar interfaces from multiple layers with 2d/3d content and an app that provides a live preview of the ar interface in realtime. over a series of four ar design jams with interaction design students, we learned about the strengths and weaknesses of both physical prototyping with paper and play-doh and digital prototyping based on these materials. future work should be dedicated to adding support for explicit user interaction using touch and gesture. as in previous work [24], we argued that a lot of the primary interaction in ar is implicit in that content needs to react to changes in the camera view. protoar’s live ar previews of all layers already make it possible to simulate interaction in a wizard of oz manner [8, 9], by manually moving 2d/3d objects around in the editor in response to the camera feed. this can be done in real-time with marker tracking enabled or disabled, and provides a useful basis for future research.",351

Designing Pronunciation Learning Tools: The Case for Interactivity against Over-Engineering,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657168,"paired role-play is a common collaborative activity in language learning classrooms, adding meaning and cultural context to the learning process. this is complemented by teachers' immediate and explicit feedback. interactive tools that provide explicit feedback during collaborative learning are scarce, however. more commonly, supporting dialogue practice takes the form of computer-aided single-student read-and-record activities. this limitation is partly due to the complexity of processing language learners' speech in unconstrained tasks. in this paper, we assess the value of pronunciation error detection algorithms within a realistic, software-aided, paired role-playing task with beginning learners of french. we found that students' pronunciations improve regardless of the type of error detector employed -- even for those using simple heuristics. we suggest that speech technologies for language learning have been too focused on engineering goals. instead, new interactive designs supporting collaboration may be used to overcome engineering limitations and properly support students' engagement. while speech technologies have improved dramatically in recent years, their use in language learning applications has largely been limited to “read-and-record” activities. teaching pronunciation continues (justifiably) to be more effectively conducted in the context of classroom instruction, through activities such as paired role-playing. speech-enabled computerassisted pronunciation training (capt) applications do not yet provide adequate support to such environments despite a need for them, particularly in larger-size classrooms. we investigated the suitability of capt speech technologies, specifically pronunciation error detectors (peds), for providing feedback in role-playing tasks for beginner learners of french. our ecologically valid experiment provides evidence that sentence-level processing with no fine-grained audio processing can support the language learning process. we propose that the design of capt systems to perform a specific task within an interaction between two learners is far more important to learning outcomes than technological goals, making the field perfectly ripe for hci intervention.",354
"From Her Story, to Our Story: Digital Storytelling as Public Engagement around Abortion Rights Advocacy in Ireland",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657169,"despite the divisive nature of abortion within the republic of ireland and northern ireland, where access to safe, legal abortion is severely restricted, effecting legislative reform demands widespread public support. in light of a building pro-choice counter-voice, this work contributes to a growing body of hci research that takes an activist approach to design. we report findings from four design workshops with 31 pro-choice stakeholders across ireland in which we positioned an exploratory protosite, herstorytold, to engender critical conversations around the use of sensitive abortion narratives as a tool for engagement. our analysis shows how digital storytelling can help reject false narratives and raise awareness of the realities of abortion laws. it suggests design directions to curate narratives that provoke empathy, foster polyvocality, and ultimately expand the engaged community. furthermore, this research calls for designers to actively support community mobilization through providing 'stepping stones' to activism. this research has addressed a current dearth in hci for reproductive rights and responded to calls for activist design that stimulates critical conversations around contested issues. we have pointed to design opportunities for digital storytelling to be effectively curated as an advocacy tool. specifically, we have presented opportunities to: raise awareness and challenge stigma through the exposing of hidden realities; foster empathy and polyvocality as a means of expanding the collective community; and provide stepping stones to activism that allow for engagement at different levels. in doing so, we respond to calls for further-understanding of how digital storytelling might be used beyond catharsis, and contribute insight into a gap in knowledge about the role online engagement plays in effecting tangible change.",355
"Capturing, Representing, and Interacting with Laughter",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657160,"we investigate a speculative future in which we celebrate happiness by capturing laughter and representing it in tangible forms. we explored technologies for capturing naturally occurring laughter as well as various physical representations of it. for several weeks, our participants collected audio samples of everyday conversations with their loved ones. we processed those samples through a machine learning algorithm and shared the resulting tangible representations (e.g., physical containers and edible displays) with our participants. in collecting, listening to, interacting with, and sharing their laughter with loved ones, participants described both joy in preserving and interacting with laughter and tension in collecting it. this study revealed that the tangibility of laughter representations matters, especially its symbolism and material quality. we discuss design implications of giving permanent forms to laughter and consider the sound of laughter as a part of our personal past that we might seek to preserve and reflect upon. we demonstrated that laughter can be given enduring forms and play a role in people’s reflection on past memory both in personal and social contexts. this work contributes a qualitative evaluation of our prototype system for capturing, representing, and interacting with laughter. our study showed that the tangibility of a laughter representation matters, as it serves to reconstrue what was once disembodied into a concrete reminder of a happy moment that people can preserve or share with others. we also found that people valued the ensoulment of objects with their loved ones’ laughter, not the quantity of laughter itself. we offered design insights for considering the sound of laughter as a part of our past we would want to preserve and reflect upon.",356
Geocaching with a Beam: Shared Outdoor Activities through a Telepresence Robot with 360 Degree Viewing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657161,"people often enjoy sharing outdoor activities together such as walking and hiking. however, when family and friends are separated by distance it can be difficult if not impossible to share such activities. we explore this design space by investigating the benefits and challenges of using a telepresence robot to support outdoor leisure activities. in our study, participants participated in the outdoor activity of geocaching where one person geocached with the help of a remote partner via a telepresence robot. we compared a wide field of view (wfov) camera to a 360° camera. results show the benefits of having a physical embodiment and a sense of immersion with the 360° view. yet challenges related to a lack of environmental awareness, safety issues, and privacy concerns resulting from bystander interactions. these findings illustrate the need to design telepresence robots with the environment and public in mind to provide an enhanced sensory experience while balancing safety and privacy issues resulting from being amongst the general public. our work builds on the related literature by exploring the use of telepresence robots for supporting outdoor leisure activities over distance. here we focused on geocaching as an exemplar activity given that it contains a variety of basic activities within it including, walking or hiking, conversing, and looking for specific objects (similar to sightseeing). we found that by having a physical embodiment in the form of a telepresence robot, remote participants felt a strong sense of presence in the remote space. the mobility of the robot aided these feelings. the experience was limited, however, as remote users did not always have a strong understanding of the environment and they missed out on sensations typical of outdoor spaces, e.g., smells, wind, warmth from the sun. we also found challenges as a result of being in a public space with a variety of people with the potential for different perspectives and safety and privacy issues. these findings show that if telepresence robots are to be used to support outdoor leisure activities, similar to those we studied, that designs can be improved through the incorporation of additional environmental sensations as well as features to balance safety and privacy issues resulting from being amongst the general public. of course, outdoor leisure activities can be more complex than the basic activities we studied. they might, for example, involve sports or activities with greater movement (e.g., throwing a frisbee). it is likely that our findings about safety, privacy, and environmental concerns with telepresence robots extend to other settings, yet different types of telepresence robots would certainly be required with additional capabilities (e.g., faster movement, arms) for other more complex types of leisure activities.",357
PalmTouch: Using the Palm as an Additional Input Modality on Commodity Smartphones,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657162,"touchscreens are the most successful input method for smartphones. despite their flexibility, touch input is limited to the location of taps and gestures. we present palmtouch, an additional input modality that differentiates between touches of fingers and the palm. touching the display with the palm can be a natural gesture since moving the thumb towards the device's top edge implicitly places the palm on the touchscreen. we present different use cases for palmtouch, including the use as a shortcut and for improving reachability. to evaluate these use cases, we have developed a model that differentiates between finger and palm touch with an accuracy of 99.53% in realistic scenarios. results of the evaluation show that participants perceive the input modality as intuitive and natural to perform. moreover, they appreciate palmtouch as an easy and fast solution to address the reachability issue during one-handed smartphone interaction compared to thumb stretching or grip changes. we presented palmtouch, an additional input modality on smartphones using the palm to perform input. we proposed four use cases and evaluated palmtouch in a user study. participants perceived palmtouch as a natural and intuitive gesture for a wide range of use cases, including the use as a shortcut and to improve reachability in one-handed scenarios. we investigated an abstract scenario in which we addressed reachability issues during one-handed smartphone interaction and found that palmtouch was perceived as an easier, faster and more accurate solution than a grip change which could drop the device. while a quantitative analysis revealed that participants were indeed faster with palmtouch, they appreciated its short learning curve. especially on recent devices with an edge-to-edge display (e.g., iphone x), palmtouch provides an alternative to the removed home button. we implemented palmtouch using capacitive images collected in a controlled study, and a convolutional neural network to differentiate between touches being made by fingers and palms. in contrast to previous work, our approach uses low-resolution fingerprints instead of heuristics that only work with multiple touch points (i.e., pen and palm) or that would introduce latency through temporal features. this enables us to build a model with an accuracy of 99.53% in a realistic scenario evaluation. since we only modified the software of an off-the-shelf nexus 5 smartphone, palmtouch could be readily deployed onto recent smartphones, e.g., through software updates. we focused on the feasibility and usability of palmtouch as an input modality on smartphones. with a precision of 99.35%, we showed a neglectable likelihood of unintended triggers either through classification errors or unintended palm touches. future work could evaluate palmtouch in the wild and investigate unintended palm touches. the palm detection model could be extended to differentiate between unintended and intended palm touches to support the device’s native palm rejection and to improve the accuracy of intended palm touches.",358
How “Wide Walls” Can Increase Engagement: Evidence From a Natural Experiment in Scratch,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657163,"a core aim for designing constructionist learning systems and toolkits is enabling ""wide walls""-a metaphor used to describe supporting a diverse range of creative outcomes. ensuring that a broad design space is afforded to learners by a toolkit is a common approach to achieving wide walls. we use econometric methods to provide an empirical test of the wide walls theory through a natural experiment in the scratch online community. we estimate the causal effect of a policy change that gave a large number of scratch users access to a more powerful version of scratch data structures, effectively widening the walls for learners. we show that access to and use of these more powerful new data structures caused learners to use data structures more frequently. our findings provide support for the theory that wide walls can increase engagement and learning. we believe that our work represents the first large-scale quantitative test of the “wide walls” design principle. these results are excellent news for designers who apply this popular and influential principle, as well as for proponents of constructionism. although not without limitations or caveats, we hope that our estimates of a positive causal effect of wider walls will encourage more designers of educational technology and creativity support tools to adopt the principle in their practice.",359
Activity Tracking in vivo,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657164,"while recent research has emphasized the importance of understanding the lived experience of personal tracking, very little is known about the everyday coordination between tracker use and the surrounding environment. we combine behavioral data from trackers with video recordings from wearable cameras, in an attempt to understand how usage unfolds in daily life and how it is shaped by the context of use. we recorded twelve participants' daily use of activity trackers, collecting and analyzing 244 incidents where activity trackers were used. among our findings, tracker use was strongly driven by reflection and learning-in action, contrasting the traditional view that learning is one of deep exploration, following the collection of data on behaviors. we leverage on these insights and propose three directions for the design of activity trackers: facilitating learning through glances, providing normative feedback and facilitating micro-plans. in closing, our study took a step forward towards understanding how tracker use is enmeshed within everyday life, and how these devices could be better designed to support long-term use. activity tracking, as a practice, is diversified, dependent upon and threaded into what goes on around us. following these developments is difficult. yet, as these devices become ever more central to the ongoing discourse on behavior change and patientdriven healthcare, a richer understanding of the lived dynamics of activity tracking trackers is crucial.",360
Understanding Users' Capability to Transfer Information between Mixed and Virtual Reality: Position Estimation across Modalities and Perspectives,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657175,"mixed reality systems combine physical and digital worlds, with great potential for the future of hci. it is possible to design systems that support flexible degrees of virtuality by combining complementary technologies. in order for such systems to succeed, users must be able to create unified mental models out of heterogeneous representations. in this paper, we present two studies focusing on the users' accuracy on heterogeneous systems using spatial augmented reality (sar) and immersive virtual reality (vr) displays, and combining viewpoints (egocentric and exocentric). the results show robust estimation capabilities across conditions and viewpoints. in this work we presented the results of two user studies that focus on the user’s accuracy in mixed reality systems contrasted with pure vr versions. the first study considered variations – and similarities – between conditions from an egocentric viewpoint, while the second study evaluated the complementarity of egocentric and non-egocentric viewpoints for target estimation. the obtained results indicate that, as with other spatial tasks, the accurate perception of the space is supported by the presence of landmarks. participants showed a remarkable capability to transfer information between sar and vr modalities, even between ego/exocentric povs. additionally, perceiving the scene from closer seems to increase the participants’ expectations on their accuracy. it is worth mentioning that depth compression was significantly higher than in purely physical scenarios only for egocentric tasks that happened solely in vr. hybrid mr conditions do not seem to suffer from this any more than in purely physical tasks in the case of egocentric estimation. additionally, the lack of depth compression when changing scale (study 2) challenges previous work [33], perhaps caused by the range (peripersonal space) and the availability of landmarks (both physical and virtual). these results indicate that the participants were able to construct a unified mental model from heterogeneous representations and views. the presented research follows a rich history of perception and cognition studies, proposing the evaluation of mixed and hybrid systems from both a perceptual and cognitive standpoints. in the future, it would be of interest to study up to which extent the complementarity of modalities extends to real world scenarios, by exploring more complex and ecological tasks. finally, it would be important to test the limits of systems with heterogeneous representations, looking for cases where users cannot transfer knowledge between display modalities.",361
Seemo: A Computational Approach to See Emotions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657176,"successful human interactions are based on becoming aware of other's emotion and making adaptations accordingly. however, understanding emotion is a complex task that has generated countless debates among researchers over the past decades. the abstract nature of human emotion highlights the need for a new data-driven approach that can better describe and compare across fine-grained emotional states. in this study, we propose seemo, a novel neural embedding framework, which allows us to map human emotions into vector space representations. seemo is trained using twitter data and is evaluated on two fundamental use cases in traditional emotion research: determining the underlying dimensions of emotions and identifying the set of basic emotions. the evaluation reveals that on both tasks seemo can generate results consistent with the mainstream theories. results also show that the vector space representation of seemo can effectively decode the important relationships between emotions that were usually not explicitly presented. motivated from a practical standpoint, in this study we proposed seemo, a deep learning based model, to map human emotions into vector space representations. to prove the validity and practicality of seemo, we trained it using twitter data and applied the derived emotion vector space on testing two classic emotion philosophies: the valence-arousal space model of emotion, and the theory of basic emotions. the consistent findings on both use cases with mainstream views in the literature proved seemo’s effectiveness as an alternative assessment for psychologists to conduct largerscale emotion studies.",362
"Knowing You, Seeing Me: Investigating User Preferences in Drone-Human Acknowledgement",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657177,"in the past, human proxemics research has poorly predicted human robot interaction distances. this paper presents three studies on drone gestures to acknowledge human presence and clarify suitable acknowledging distances. we evaluated four drone gestures based on non-verbal human greetings. the gestures included orienting towards the counterpart and salutation gestures. we tested these individually and in combination to create a feeling of acknowledgement in people. our users preferred being acknowledged from two meters away but gestures were also effective from four meters. rotating the drone towards the user elicited a higher degree of acknowledgement than without. we conclude with a set design guidelines for drone gestures. people prefer drones to acknowledge them from two meters away at the very least. people feel acknowledged by drone gestures both at short (2m) and larger distances (4m). designers can combine orienting and salutational gestures in drone flight paths and achieve high levels of acknowledgments in users. drone users will feel more acknowledged by drones with recognizable fronts to support the orienting gestures. to obtain valid results on acknowledgment distances drones need to fly freely, i.e. not tied to rails, but wind and even indoor ventilation can pose a challenge to accurate flight execution. future work should look into other gestures, e.g. slowing down from long-distance travel speed, flying in a circle, or bopping up and down, and how sound, size, and approach angles of drones affect acknowledgement. it is important to note, as well, that some of our tested gestures might prove problematic in scenarios in which drone payload is sensitive to sudden displacement from a waggle, e.g. when delivering a pizza in a box.",363
Evaluating CoBlox: A Comparative Study of Robotics Programming Environments for Adult Novices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657178,"a new wave of collaborative robots designed to work alongside humans is bringing the automation historically seen in large-scale industrial settings to new, diverse contexts. however, the ability to program these machines often requires years of training, making them inaccessible or impractical for many. this paper rethinks what robot programming interfaces could be in order to make them accessible and intuitive for adult novice programmers. we created a block-based interface for programming a one-armed industrial robot and conducted a study with 67 adult novices comparing it to two programming approaches in widespread use in industry. the results show participants using the block-based interface successfully implemented robot programs faster with no loss in accuracy while reporting higher scores for usability, learnability, and overall satisfaction. the contribution of this work is showing the potential for using block-based programming to make powerful technologies accessible to a wider audience. the goal of this work was to explore ways of making industrial robot programming more accessible to people with little or no prior programming experience. drawing on successful design strategies used to introduce young learners to the practice of programming, we created coblox and showed how it outperforms the most wide-spread robotics programming approaches used today. the analysis shows the coblox helped adult novices program more tasks successfully by decreasing time on task while maintaining quality. in addition, the participants found it easier to use and enjoyed it more. collectively, with this work, we advance our understanding of ways to make robot programming more accessible to a wider range of users. we view robotics as merely a single example of a field in which a block-based interface can be used. this study shows the block-based approach making a robotics programming task easier for novice adults, providing an empirical basis for future work concerned with making programming accessible to all. in doing so, we contribute to the larger goal of giving people access to and control over the technologies around us.",364
Rolling-Menu: Rapid Command Selection in Toolbars Using Roll Gestures with a Multi-DoF Mouse,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657179,"this paper presents rolling-menu, a technique for selecting toolbar items, based on the use of roll gestures with a multidimensional device, the roly-poly mouse (rpm). rolling-menu reduces object-command transition, resulting in a better integration between command selection and direct manipulation of application objects. selecting a toolbar item with rolling-menu requires rolling rpm in a predefined direction corresponding to the item. we propose a design space of rolling-menu that includes different roll mapping and validation modes. a first user's study, with a simple toolbar containing up to 14 items, establishes that the best version of rolling-menu takes, on average, up to 29% less time than the mouse to select a toolbar item. moreover accuracy of the selection with rolling-menu is above 90%. both the validation mode and the mapping between roll direction and toolbar items influence the performance of rolling-menus. a second study compares the three best versions of rolling-menu with the mouse to select an item in two types of multidimensional toolbars: a toolbar containing dropdown lists, and a grid toolbar. results confirm the advantage of rolling-menu over a mouse. in this work we presented different roll-based techniques for command selection in toolbars. the aim of these techniques is to minimize disruptive transitions between the working area and the toolbar. to do so, rolling-menus rely on the detection of roll gestures performed in the direction of the toolbar itemsto select. based on different design dimensions, we proposed 8 versions of rolling-menu that we compared to the mouse for selecting a top-level item in a simple toolbar, or sub-items in more complex toolbars, i.e. a dropdown and a grid toolbar. our user studies demonstrated that two rolling-menus reduce the selection time for a toplevel item or sub-item, while keeping a good or very good accuracy.",365
Effects of Enhanced Gaze Presentation on Gaze Leading in Remote Collaborative Physical Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657170,"with respect to collaborative physical tasks, gaze and gestures play significant roles when referring to physical objects. in video-mediated communication, however, such nonverbal cues become ""ineffectual"" when they are presented via a 2d monitor, making video-mediated collaborative physical tasks inefficient. this study focuses on gaze cues to support remote collaborative physical tasks and uses an eye-shaped display, ""thirdeye,"" a simple add-on display that represents a remote participant's gaze direction. thirdeye is expected to be especially effective when used with mobile terminals. we investigated whether the thirdeye's gaze shift is effective in leading a local observer's attention toward objects in the local environment, even when thirdeye is presented with the actual face image of a remote person. experimental results show that thirdeye can lead the local participant's attention to intended objects faster than without thirdeye. the purpose of our study was to support gaze cue in remote collaborative physical tasks, especially when participants use mobile terminals for video communication. thirdeye is a simple add-on display that represents a remote participant's gaze direction; it was expected to be suitable for our purpose. therefore, this study focused on investigating the effect of thirdeye on leading an observer’s gaze. we assumed a case in which thirdeye is used in combination with normal video communication software that shows the actual face image of a remote participant. thus, we conducted a simple video communication experiment and compared the cases of “with thirdeye” and “without thirdeye.” the results show that thirdeye was effective in leading the participants’ gaze faster to target objects, even when thirdeye and the remote participant's face were presented together. furthermore, the objective measures suggest that thirdeye was cognitively effective.",366
Dream Lens: Exploration and Visualization of Large-Scale Generative Design Datasets,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657171,"this paper presents dream lens, an interactive visual analysis tool for exploring and visualizing large-scale generative design datasets. unlike traditional computer aided design, where users create a single model, with generative design, users specify high-level goals and constraints, and the system automatically generates hundreds or thousands of candidates all meeting the design criteria. once a large collection of design variations is created, the designer is left with the task of finding the design, or set of designs, which best meets their requirements. this is a complicated task which could require analyzing the structural characteristics and visual aesthetics of the designs. two studies are conducted which demonstrate the usability and usefulness of the dream lens system, and a generatively designed dataset of 16,800 designs for a sample design problem is described and publicly released to encourage advancement in this area. overall, we believe dream lens represents a novel contribution to the area of interactively exploring large collections of 3d models, particularly those with subtle variations in their aesthetic and physical properties. combined with contributing a dataset of 16,800 generatively designed solutions to the same design problem, we hope our work can serve to inspire future research in this area.",367

"Everything We Do, Everything We Press: Data-Driven Remote Performance Management in a Mobile Workplace",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657173,"this paper examines how data-driven performance monitoring technologies affect the work of telecommunications field engineers. as a mobile workforce, this occupational group rely on an array of smartphone applications to plan, manage and report on their jobs, and to liaise remotely with managers and colleagues. these technologies intend to help field engineers be more productive and have greater control over their work; however they also gather data related to the quantity and effectiveness of their labor. we conducted a qualitative study examining engineers' experiences of these systems. our findings suggest they simultaneously enhance worker autonomy, support co-ordination with and monitoring of colleagues, but promote anxieties around productivity and the interpretation of data by management. we discuss the implications of data-driven performance management technologies on worker agency, and examine the consequences of such systems in an era of quantified workplaces. we studied the work of field engineers and the roles that new performance enhancement and management technologies play in their workplace. although field engineers see some value in these systems, they have also induced feelings of disconnection from colleagues, and raised concerns about being monitored and remotely performance managed. moreover, while these technologies simplified aspects of the engineer’s work, their use simultaneously led to experiences of work intensification and perceptions of greater responsibility and accountability that rendered any gain of greater job control disputable. our findings further highlighted the range of acts of resistance engineers have developed and adopted to compensate for lost privacy. we also saw how engineers engage in new forms of work to respond to the demands of these systems in relation to the unexpected interactions they cause with colleagues and customers, and to maintain their schedules for the day. our study provides insight into the use of monitoring and remote performance management technologies in the workplace, and sheds light into a commonplace yet understudied workplace and worker occupation.",369
Social Affordances at Play: Game Design Toward Socio-Technical Innovation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657174,"in this paper we propose that game design strategies and theories can be useful tools for supporting the design of innovative socio-technical systems aimed at supporting social co-presence. we support this proposal with an annotated portfolio of a series of research prototype games that investigate sensor affordances and configurations to sustain and enhance social co-presence. we introduce relevant theory from game studies (the magic circle; the mda (mechanics/dynamics/aesthetics framework)) to help ground and guide the use of game design in hci practice. we conclude with recommendations for adopting game design as a supplementary research technique, with caveats about the limits of the approach. in this paper, we claim that game design theory and techniques can be of value in tackling the design challenge of developing technologies to support and enhance copresence. we introduced a concept (‘the magic circle’) and a framework (mda) from game studies, and used an annotated portfolio of our design work to illustrate some insights we gleaned from developing collocated social games while making use of these ideas. we concluded with some general patterns that were extrapolated from this body of work, which of course drew upon extant hci research and theory as well. we do not mean to propose that game design theory and techniques could or should supplant what is already known, but instead, propose that they can be useful additions to a designer’s toolkit. we are currently taking what we’ve learned from this cycle of research-through-design into the creation of non-game technology to support collocated social engagement. we are constructing technical prototypes nested in activities that draw upon the design insights as well as the general patterns for creating viable support for robust and pleasurable moment-to-moment felt experience. we have come to realize many non-game encounters are ‘magic circles’ in their own right—spaces in which people engage in collective action that sustains experiences which may be instrumental, but which also are weighed and valued for their moment-by-moment texture. we are especially interested in developing co-presence support technologies to enhance mutual attention and connection, and see the work described in this paper as useful for breaking away from embedded technology biases to move toward achieving these aims. we hope our results and recommendations will be useful to others investigating ways that interactive technology can enhance the fabric of everyday co-present social life and activity, whether for work or for play.",370
A Critical Examination of Feedback in Early Reading Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657185,"learning games now play a role in both formal and informal learning, including foundational skills such as literacy. while feedback is recognised as a key pedagogical dimension of these games, particularly in early learning, there has been no research on how commercial games available to schools and parents reify learning theory into feedback. using a systematic content analysis, we examine how evidence-based feedback principles manifest in five widely-used learning games designed to foster young children's reading skills. our findings highlight strengths in how games deliver feedback when players succeed. many of the games, however, were inconsistent and not proactive when providing error feedback, often promoting trial and error strategies. furthermore, there was a lack of support for learning the game mechanics and a preference for task-oriented rewards less deeply embedded in the gameplay. our research provides a design and research agenda for the inclusion of feedback in early learning games. this paper identified the importance of evaluating how feedback is currently designed in early learning games. to achieve this, we consolidated, refined and applied a comprehensive game content analysis framework, to analyse several widely-used reading games for young children. this descriptive analysis was followed by a critical evaluation of existing early learning game feedback decisions, drawing from the games and learning literature to problematize them. this research makes three main contributions. firstly, in consolidating and reflexively applying a holistic framework for evaluating feedback in early learning game design we offer a new methodological tool. this tool was based on three existing broad frameworks, and unifies codes for feedback in learning and learning games as well as game rewards. this methodology supports a fine-grained level analysis of game feedback, serving designers and practitioners who may want to use it as a guide for design or as an evaluation tool for games in reading and other domains. in applying this tool to games within the reading domain we refined and added new codes. we encourage others utilising this tool in different domains and game genres to similarly iterate its dimensions in order to further widen its scope and relevance. secondly, we provide a characterisation of the broad game genres for early reading. we uncovered a prioritisation of task-oriented learning over intrinsically integrated learning content within the games, with more playful and immersive features of games such as rewards and praise as well as punishments limited. this focus on task-oriented learning, as opposed to learning through play, problematizes the kind of learning taking place, the limited space for more immersive games and the tension of including games within tightly packed curricula. additionally, our analysis showed an important division between games for learning and games for practice. the lack of instruction in some games calls for practitioners to carefully evaluate their game choices to ensure pupils have the necessary knowledge prior to game play. finally, and most importantly, our research allows us to identify strengths and weaknesses, as well as open questions, for the future design work in the area of game feedback. specifically, while most games supported a clear direction on where the player was going (feed up), there were weaknesses in how the provision of feedback during game play (feed back) was delivered. this gap was especially visible in how little support children were offered to recover from their errors. given our focus and scope, our analysis was limited to the reading domain, and within this we recognise that many of the games focused on phonics. however, by examining the reading domain in depth, and articulating our methodological process, we allow other researchers to conduct similar analyses, ascertaining transferability to other domains [54], for instance to mathematics. future research can build upon our findings to consider if the domain and its complexity, e.g. low-level skills such as phonics or basic arithmetic compared to high-level-skills such as comprehension or interpreting statistics, impact on how game feedback is designed. equally, this work could be extended to other learning games types (beyond minigames) with more complex narratives such as immersive games where further aspects such as feedback timing may have greater importance [23]. in closing, we hope that our work will shine a spotlight on the importance of well-designed feedback for early learning games, carving out priorities that direct game design developments in this area, whilst providing a guide for practitioners to evaluate the plethora of existing learning games toward ensuring meaningful learning experiences for young learners.",371
HCI meets Material Science: A Literature Review of Morphing Materials for the Design of Shape-Changing Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657186,"with the proliferation of flexible displays and the advances in smart materials, it is now possible to create interactive devices that are not only flexible but can reconfigure into any shape on demand. several human computer interaction (hci) and robotics researchers have started designing, prototyping and evaluating shape-changing devices, realising, however, that this vision still requires many engineering challenges to be addressed. on the material science front, we need breakthroughs in stable and accessible materials to create novel, proof-of-concept devices. on the interactive devices side, we require a deeper appreciation for the material properties and an understanding of how exploiting material properties can provide affordances that unleash the human interactive potential. while these challenges are interesting for the respective research fields, we believe that the true power of shape-changing devices can be magnified by bringing together these communities. in this paper we therefore present a review of advances made in shape-changing materials and discuss their applications within an hci context. with the aim of accelerating the design of shape-changing devices, we have provided a review of the advances in material science from an hci perspective. we see this approach as a road map for next generation designers that want to better understand material science and adopt shape-changing mechanisms in their work. we also believe that creating ouis requires a redefinition of the tools we use during the design process. the tools needed for shaped-interface design need to be more expressive, like the raw and versatile materials an industrial designer might use to create complex geometries. a change like this can happen if hci practitioners are attentive to shape-change developments from a material science perspective. this work is a step in this direction as it bridges a gap between material science, hci and shape-change.",372
Ticket to Talk: Supporting Conversation between Young People and People with Dementia through Digital Media,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657187,"we explore the role of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions between people with dementia and young people. though meaningful social interaction is integral to quality of life in dementia, initiating conversation with a person with dementia can be challenging, especially for younger people who may lack knowledge of someone's life history. this can be further compounded without a nuanced understanding of the nature of dementia, along with an unfamiliarity in leading and maintaining conversation. we designed a mobile application - ticket to talk - to support intergenerational interactions by encouraging young people to collect media relevant to individuals with dementia to use in conversations with people with dementia. we evaluated ticket to talk through trials with two families, a care home, and groups of older people. we highlight difficulties in using technologies such as this as a conversational tool, the value of digital media in supporting intergenerational interactions, and the potential to positively shape people with dementia's agency in social settings. we present ticket to talk as a novel technology that encourages and supports conversations between young people and their older relatives living with dementia. ticket to talk achieves this through the collection and curation of digital media related to an older relatives’ past experiences, providing talking points for young people. the project identifies the themes of ‘promoting and managing reminiscence, ‘starting and maintaining conversation’, and ‘redistributing agency’ as its findings. we discuss: the benefits and challenges in promoting and managing conversations; the methods of using digital media to stimulate intergenerational interactions; and finally, the positive and negative ramifications of using technology to influence people with dementia’s agency in social settings. ticket to talk can be used to position people with dementia as story tellers and advice givers, bridge conversational gaps, and reaffirm connectivity in families.",373
Falling for Fake News: Investigating the Consumption of News via Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657188,"in the so called 'post-truth' era, characterized by a loss of public trust in various institutions, and the rise of 'fake news' disseminated via the internet and social media, individuals may face uncertainty about the veracity of information available, whether it be satire or malicious hoax. we investigate attitudes to news delivered by social media, and subsequent verification strategies applied, or not applied, by individuals. a survey reveals that two thirds of respondents regularly consumed news via facebook, and that one third had at some point come across fake news that they initially believed to be true. an analysis task involving news presented via facebook reveals a diverse range of judgement forming strategies, with participants relying on personal judgements as to plausibility and scepticism around sources and journalistic style. this reflects a shift away from traditional methods of accessing the news, and highlights the difficulties in combating the spread of fake news. this paper has shown, through an online survey and study, that social media users are aware of and encountering what can be characterised as “fake news.” a think aloud study has subsequently revealed various interpretative and argumentative strategies used by readers when asked to make judgements on the truthfulness of news presented in a social media feed. our participants’ behaviour suggests that they assess news differently when it is presented via social media, including drawing upon a variety of formal and judgement based characteristics, potentially challenging traditionally hierarchical information provision, and demonstrating that perceived levels of interest in topics is a key factor when considering solutions to echo chambers and fake news.",374
'It's Reducing a Human Being to a Percentage': Perceptions of Justice in Algorithmic Decisions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657189,"data-driven decision-making consequential to individuals raises important questions of accountability and justice. indeed, european law provides individuals limited rights to 'meaningful information about the logic' behind significant, autonomous decisions such as loan approvals, insurance quotes, and cv filtering. we undertake three experimental studies examining people's perceptions of justice in algorithmic decision-making under different scenarios and explanation styles. dimensions of justice previously observed in response to human decision-making appear similarly engaged in response to algorithmic decisions. qualitative analysis identified several concerns and heuristics involved in justice perceptions including arbitrariness, generalisation, and (in)dignity. quantitative analysis indicates that explanation styles primarily matter to justice perceptions only when subjects are exposed to multiple different styles---under repeated exposure of one style, scenario effects obscure any explanation effects. our results suggests there may be no 'best' approach to explaining algorithmic decisions, and that reflection on their automated nature both implicates and mitigates justice dimensions. algorithmic decisions are likely to become increasingly relied on for a range of decisions with potentially important repercussions for those affected. understanding how people assess the fairness of such decisions, and how explanations might help, is therefore of increasing significance. despite repeated calls for more transparency over how such decisions are made, there is still much to learn about what people want and need to know about algorithms in order to hold them accountable to justice. as lawmakers legislate for mandatory provision of information to decision-subjects, human-computer interaction research has much to offer in how such information should be extracted, presented and delivered. this paper suggests that people do consider justice-related aspects of algorithmic decision-making systems, much as they do for manual decision-making processes. however, depending on how and when they are deployed, explanations may or may not help individuals to evaluate the fairness of such decisions. the algorithmic nature of these systems results in an array of novel considerations which are not captured by traditional research on perceptions of justice. conversely, creators of ml explanation systems have not typically designed them with the information needs of those individuals facing significant personal consequences of model outputs in mind. it is our hope that such concerns will instigate renewed focus on this range of important use cases for algorithmic explanations, and more broadly for hci research to support the pursuit of justice as algorithmic decision-making systems take hold in a wide array of high-stakes domains.",375
"I Really did That: Sense of Agency with Touchpad, Keyboard, and On-skin Interaction",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657180,"input on the skin is emerging as an interaction style. at chi 2012, coyle and colleagues identified an increase in the sense of agency (soa) as one benefit of skin input. however, their study only compared skin input to button presses and has not, to our knowledge, been replicated. therefore, we had 24 participants compare skin input to both button presses and touchpad input, measuring soa using the libet clock paradigm. we replicate previous findings regarding increased soa in skin versus button input and also find that soa for skin is significantly increased compared to touchpad input. interview data addressing subjective experience further support these findings. we discuss agency and the experiences associated with skin input, as well as differences to input with non-skin devices. input on the skin is emerging as an interaction style; earlier work has suggested that this is tied to the sense of agency when interacting on ones own skin. in particular, coyle et al. [4] provided data showing increased intentional binding for on-skin interaction compared to interaction using a button. we have replicated these findings and shown that the differences in agency can also be found with other devices than buttons (here, a touchpad). we also showed that the subjective experience of interaction is not affected in a straightforward manner by these differences, calling for further work that investigates if sense of agency affects conscious user experience.",376
The Impact of Abstract vs. Concrete Feedback Design on Behavior Insights from a Large Eco-Driving Field Experiment,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657181,"about 17% of the worldwide co2-emissions can be ascribed to road transportation. using information systems (is)-enabled feedback has shown to be very efficient in promoting a less fuel-consuming driving style. today, in-car is that provide feedback on driving behavior are in the midst of a fundamental change. increasing digitalization of in-car is enables virtually any kind of feedback. still, we see a gap in the empirical evidence on how to leverage this potential, raising questions on future hci-based feedback design. to address this knowledge gap, we designed an eco-driving feedback is and, building upon construal level theory, hypothesize that abstract feedback is more effective in reducing fuel consumption than concrete feedback. deployed in a large field experiment with 56 participants covering over 297,000km, we provide first empirical evidence that supports this hypothesis. despite its limitations, this research may have general implications for the design of real-time feedback. in our research, we investigate the impact of abstract versus concrete feedback on eco-driving. based on existing research we predict that abstract feedback is more effective in reducing fuel consumption than concrete feedback. this hypothesis led the design process of an edfis artifact, which we evaluated in a rigorous field experiment with 56 participants that together drove over 297,000km in 21,608 trips. the edfis stimuli were developed based on inputs from practice and hci research, using methods from design science research and theoretical implications from construal level theory. the results indicate that abstract feedback significantly reduces fuel consumption, while concrete feedback did mostly not have an effect, thus pointing towards confirmation of our hypothesis. this effect could not be explained by differences between the groups in respect to their eco-driving motivation, their attitude towards eco-driving nor their preference for a specific type of feedback. hence, the research at hand is the first to demonstrate the impact of different feedback designs, namely abstract vs. concrete feedback design, on eco-driving behavior in a rigorous field experiment. practitioners in hci may consider the power of information abstraction in the design of visual feedback systems. there are some limitations in the research design and analysis that should be addressed in future work. regarding research design, one limitation is the sample size and sample specificity. though we cover quite a lot of km in driving data, for intergroup comparisons with our three groups, the sample size of 56 drivers is sub-optimal. additionally, our sample was drawn from professional road assistance drivers. therefore, the eco-driving motivation and potential of our participants was restricted by two key factors. first, fuel expenses are covered by the drivers’ employer. second, in case of a customer service request, the drivers’ first priority is to get to the spot of the incidence as fast as possible, thereby disregarding eco-friendly driving. if any, however, we argue that this made it harder to find an effect. therefore, we would in fact expect even stronger results if our research would be replicated with a sample of regular drivers. another limitation is the design of our experimental stimuli (figures 2a vs. 2b) that apparently differ in more than one factor from each other. this research tries to shed light on whether there is a potential effect of abstract feedback design on behavior by initially combining several construal level inducing factors. future research will have to disentangle these factors and distinguish them from competing theories with more clarity [25]. regarding the control stimulus, we cannot exclude a possible effect of the g-radar on fuel consumption, even though we doubt that it had an effect, as no number or color provides normative feedback to the driver. additionally, an effect of the g-radar cannot explain the differences in fuel consumption between the groups in the treatment phase as compared to the baseline phase. apart from tackling these shortcomings, we see further potential for future research in deepening the analyses in two ways. firstly, additional data, like weather, traffic, or road conditions should be included as they very likely have an effect on fuel consumption. by including information on the day of travel and average trip speed, we tried to cover some of these potential influences, but they surely struggle with fuzziness and hence, should be replaced by the direct measures. additionally, information on road conditions like slope or speed limit, are missing in our dataset. adding such information in the analysis both, improves the validity of the investigated effects and helps to understand the determinants of eco-driving. as a second future research stream, we propose to not only look for main effects of feedback interventions, but try to understand, which specific behaviors are changed in detail. for our example, this would mean to analyze, which specific driving behavior was affected by the different feedback types and how these behaviors are correlated with the outcome variable, i.e. fuel consumption. for example, did we change acceleration behavior, idling behavior or coasting and what is the impact for each of them on fuel consumption? our modern sensor technology gives us the possibilities to measure many different behaviors in high granularity. this could enable specific and tailored interventions in real-time. regarding the theoretical basis, we used construal level theory as it nicely explains why abstract feedback is more effective in changing eco-driving behavior than concrete feedback, but we see that other explanations could contribute to our findings as well. for example, the visualization of the growing tree that we used may contain elements of gamification. the apples that appear on very low fuel consumption could be seen as batches often used in gamification [11,35] and it may be the motivation to “let the apples grow” that drives the user to behave as intended. future research should challenge these alternative explanations by proper research designs under more controlled conditions, e.g. in a laboratory setting.",377
Tangible Landscape: A Hands-on Method for Teaching Terrain Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657182,"this paper presents novel and effective methods for teaching about topography--or shape of terrain--and assessing 3-dimensional spatial learning using tangibles. we used tangible landscape--a tangible interface for geospatial modeling--to teach multiple hands-on tangible lessons on the concepts of grading (i.e., earthwork), geomorphology, and hydrology. we examined students' ratings of the system's usability and user experience and tested students' acquisition and transfer of knowledge. our results suggest the physicality of the objects enabled the participants to effectively interact with the system and each other, positively impacting ratings of usability and task-specific knowledge building. these findings can potentially advance the design and implementation of tangible teaching methods for the topics of geography, design, architecture, and engineering. this research is unique in that it: (1) highlighted the potential of using a tangible interface–tangible landscape–to develop hands-on teaching tasks related to various geospatial, geographic, geological, planning, and landscape architecture topics; (2) demonstrated how using open-source gis grants researchers the flexibility (i.e., ability to run various types of geospatial simulations) to develop specific tangible interface tasks (water flow, landforms, cut and fill); and (3) administered assessments–analogous to the tangible lessons and tasks–to measure student learning outcomes. additionally, the observed variance in knowledge building speaks to the importance of systematically saving and recording interaction data (e.g., scanning of students’ hands to quantify amount of interaction) to accurately process, score, and assess students’ task performance. this, as well as using recorded log files to qualitatively explore interaction data will allow future researchers to uncover and understand any issues students experience when learning topics of geography, design, architecture, and engineering with tangible media. in sum, we argue that the main focus of future research should be on how geospatial learning outcomes are achieved, rather than only on what is achieved.",378
[Un]breaking News: Design Opportunities for Enhancing Collaboration in Scientific Media Production,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657183,"contemporary scientific media production requires a complex socio-technical infrastructure we call the ""media production pipeline"" (mpp). media professionals engage with researchers along the mpp to disseminate science news to the lay public. however, differing incentive structures and professional contexts frequently set researchers' values and needs at odds with those of media professionals, resulting in problematic or failed interactions. we ask the research question: what pain points in scientific media production afford opportunities for future hci innovation? we then present a grounded theory analysis of 24 interviews with researchers and media professionals, yielding several key contributions. first, we describe two collaborative domains in scientific media production between research advocates and media outlets. second, we characterize discrete technological gaps and pain points in both domains. finally, we discuss implications for design and propose solutions from hci areas like peer production, online communities, recommender systems, and online collaboration. in the modern web 2.0 information environment, stories can go viral in the blink of an eye regardless of their legitimacy. their authors are not only trained journalists, but also scientists, lay citizens, and powerful political and corporate interests, often pitted against each other in a battle for credibility. with a crisis of faith in mainstream media well underway, combined with an onslaught of science-decrying public figures spreading misinformation like wildfire, the institution of science is at a critical juncture. scientists must speak up, and they must do so effectively if their voices are to be heard through the chaotic information churn of web 2.0. this paper describes the mpp for producing scientific content in western media systems. as we have shown, much can be done to enhance collaboration with media outlets, yet scientists’ willingness to engage is clearly a prerequisite–and a point of opinionated contention. ""visible scientists"" [17, 23] who operate prominently in the public sphere can potentially use their influence to affect policy/public opinion. yet researchers risk reputations as ""show boaters"" who egotistically pander to the media or sacrifice the quality of their work to focus on career advancement through increased popularity [17]. academics rely intensely on citations to demonstrate scientific contributions, yet media engagement is of value to society and requires real work. we believe there exists a middleground. technology can possibly reduce the time and effort required of scientists to share newsworthy research responsibly with the public, and perhaps even improve scientific literacy rates, though it remains critical to consider how peoples’ ""folk theories"" [5] interact with reception of science news. we have suggested implications such as automatic tracking of research coverage in mass media, as well as expert contributions to credible and lay-accessible online resources–both of which yield quantitative metrics. in order to truly bridge the gap between science and society, the academy ought to not only study and build new media tools and systems, but also formally expand incentive structures to consider measures of public scholarship through high quality and impactful independent media production or mainstream media engagement.",379
ThermoKiosk: Investigating Roles for Digital Surveys of Thermal Experience in Workplace Comfort Management,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657184,"thermal comfort in shared workplaces is often contested and impacts productivity, wellbeing, and energy use. yet, subjective and situated comfort experiences are rarely captured and engaged with. in this paper, we explore roles for digital surveys in capturing and visualising subjective experiences of comfort in situ for comfort management. we present findings from a 3-week field trial of our prototype system called thermokiosk, which we deployed in an open plan, shared office with a history of thermal comfort complaints. in interviews with occupants and members of facilities management, we find that the data and interactions can play an important role in initiating dialogue to understand and handle tensions, and point to design considerations for more systematically integrating them into workplace comfort practices. in this paper, we presented a study of thermokiosk to understand the utility of subjective thermal comfort data in workplace comfort management. through a qualitative study with building managers and occupants, we uncover much about digital comfort surveys as a new facet in participatory comfort management. we see valuable roles for interaction design in supporting the everyday expression of subjective comfort experience, and in providing a medium for negotiating and developing the knowledge, competences, meanings, and politics required for effective collective comfort practices. for management, the data brings into question how comfort is approached in institutional policies and management practices, but further work is required to find ways to more systemically integrate it in ways that challenge these. in establishing thermal comfort as an ‘object of concern’, these findings point to interesting potential for sustainability applications: first in engaging occupants and management with alternative approaches to thermal comfort where the energy required is more closely linked to comfort experience; and secondly, in providing a platform for the establishment of new, sustainable practices.",380
"The Privilege of Immersion: Racial and Ethnic Experiences, Perceptions, and Beliefs in Digital Gaming",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657195,"people of color comprise a large proportion of the us player base, yet are systematically and grossly underrepresented in digital games. we constructed a survey to assess if players perceive this underrepresentation, how they experience these representations, and sample their beliefs about diversity and gaming. mixed-methods analyses show significant differences between players of color and white players on perception of racial norms in gaming, effects on behavior, emotions, player satisfaction, engagement, and beliefs stemming from a lack of diversity. players from all races-ethnicities overwhelmingly expressed a desire for greater diversity. we discuss reasons why our methodology shows higher dissatisfaction than previous research and discuss our findings in the context of industry's challenge to meet audience demands for greater racial diversity in games. white players appear experientially satisfied with their racial-ethnic representation in games, whereas players of color are employing common strategies to meet their needs under unnecessary discrimination. if players game to represent who they, engage and immerse themselves with greater freedom than life outside of gaming allows, it is those who face systematic discrimination that have the most to gain from changes in digital gaming’s norms. our study demonstrates that white players understand some level of what players of color experience and feel they deserve equal opportunity to be immersed in games. diversity has been shown to be wanted by players of all races-ethnicities and to benefit players of all races-ethnicities. if digital gaming intends to represent humans then it must do so carefully, as it risks harmful negative representations. accuracy, collaboration, and information is thus paramount to addressing these issues. much more than a low-risk high-reward industry choice, appropriate racial/ethnic representation and diversity is a social and moral demand—with repercussions on a host of biopsychosocial factors. if we have the resources, talent, technology, information, and creativity to create fantastical game worlds—to allow players to become superheroes, celebrities, imaginary creatures, and white— why can we not allow players of color to be themselves?",381
Stitching Infrastructures to Facilitate Telemedicine for Low-Resource Environments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657196,"telemedicine can potentially transform healthcare delivery in low-resource environments by enabling extension of medical knowledge to remote locations, thus enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the larger healthcare infrastructure. however, empirical studies have shown mixed results at best. we present a qualitative investigation of a long-standing telemedicine program operating from lucknow (uttar pradesh, india). invoking the lenses of human infrastructure and seamful spaces, we highlight the factors that determine the success of this telemedicine program. we identify and describe three important aspects: (1) conceptualizing telemedicine as the connectedness of two nodes rather than doctors and patients alone, (2) identifying the critical 'carrying agent' (local doctors at peripheral nodes) and engaging them in program design and implementation, and (3) ensuring co-creation by engaging patients in the process. finally, we discuss how our lenses allowed us to recognize the seams made visible through the juxtaposition of the infrastructures at the central and peripheral nodes, and to emphasize the human elements that addressed these seams for ensuring the facilitation of a successful telemedicine program. we conducted a qualitative investigation of a telemedicine program in india that has widely been considered successful in the indian healthcare context. this program entailed the provision of tele-consultations for thyroid cancer patients from south-east india (orissa). the central node was located in a super-specialty hospital in north india (lucknow, uttar pradesh). our findings unpacked the roles of diverse stakeholders in the human infrastructures that were engaged by this program, both at the center and the periphery. first, we laid out the role of the coordinators who ensured that a working connection was possible and information regarding patients’ conditions and doctors’ schedules was shared and managed effectively in a bidirectional flow. second, we examined the role of the local physicians/surgeons who ensured that patients were at ease and their concerns were addressed. we also found their medical and technological skills to mature over time. third, we studied the involvement of patients to highlight how they remained active throughout the telemedicine process (before, during, and in-between consultations) instead of being passive recipients of medical knowledge and guidelines. in addition to detailing the human infrastructures involved in this telemedicine set-up, we studied how the infrastructures at the center and the periphery were stitched together to facilitate tele-consultations. in particular, we drew attention to the seams that were appropriately addressed by the human infrastructures in this nimr program to allow for seamless facilitation of telemedicine.",382
BIGFile: Bayesian Information Gain for Fast File Retrieval,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657197,"we introduce bigfile, a new fast file retrieval technique based on the bayesian information gain framework. bigfile provides interface shortcuts to assist the user in navigating to a desired target (file or folder). bigfile's split interface combines a traditional list view with an adaptive area that displays shortcuts to the set of file paths estimated by our computationally efficient algorithm. users can navigate the list as usual, or select any part of the paths in the adaptive area. a pilot study of 15 users informed the design of bigfile, revealing the size and structure of their file systems and their file retrieval practices. our simulations show that bigfile outperforms fitchett et al.'s accessrank, a best-of-breed prediction algorithm. we conducted an experiment to compare bigfile with arfile (accessrank instantiated in a split interface) and with a finder-like list view as baseline. bigfile was by far the most efficient technique (up to 44% faster than arfile and 64% faster than finder), and participants unanimously preferred the split interfaces to the finder. we presented bigfile, a fast navigation-based file retrieval technique where the computer is trying to gain information from the user by providing shortcuts that may help access the target faster. these shortcuts are presented in a split adaptive area of a file retrieval interface and include the estimated files or folders selected by our computationally efficient algorithm bigfilefast, which together with the items in the current folder, maximize the expected information gain from the next user input. the interface includes the paths to the estimated items so that contextual information is provided to identify them. users can use any shortcut in the adaptive area or simply navigate the hierarchy as usual. we first ran a pilot study to better understand users’ file structures and retrieval practices. we ran simulations demonstrating the effectiveness and accuracy of bigfilefast compared to the accessrank prediction algorithm in various hierarchical structures. we also ran an experiment comparing bigfile with arfile, a split interface using accessrank, and with a finderlike list view as baseline. bigfile was up to 44% faster than arfile and 64% faster than finder, and users unanimously preferred the split interfaces. future work includes improving bigfile by adding a stability parameter and potentially repeated user behavior. we also plan to evaluate bigfile in a longitudinal study, and explore applications of the bigfilefast algorithm to other areas.",383
The Use of Private Mobile Phones at War: Accounts From the Donbas Conflict,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657198,"studying technology use in unstable and life-threatening conditions can help highlight assumptions of use built into technologies and foreground contradictions in the design of devices and services. this paper provides an account of how soldiers, volunteers, and civilians use mobile technologies in wartime, reporting on fieldwork conducted in western russia and eastern ukraine with people close to or participating directly in the armed conflict in the donbas region. we document how private mobile phones and computers became a crucial but ambiguous infrastructure despite their lack of durability in extreme conditions of a military conflict, and their government and military surveillance potential. our participants rely on a combination of myths and significant technical knowledge to negotiate the possibilities mobile technologies offer and the life-threatening reality of enemy surveillance they engender. we consider the problems of always-on always-connected devices under conditions of war and surveillance and our responsibilities as hci practitioners in the design of social technologies. our study demonstrates that in considerations of mobile technologies two points are important from the point of view of hci research and design. first, any mobile technology-based solution relies on availability of infrastructures supporting telephony, and must consider who owns and controls these. second, data sent across mobile infrastructures is always vulnerable and makes visible its producers and consumers. such visibility can have significant and even life-threatening consequences, calling for a rethinking of design objectives for consumer communication devices. given the rapid development of military surveillance technologies in an increasingly unstable world, what does it mean to be digitally visible? we argue that users of social media and communication technologies have a right to an understanding of surveillance practices by the state, the platforms and the military industrial complex. it is crucial to ask: how might hci help make surveillance detection a mundane, everyday practice? how might we enable people to respond in ways that can protect and support them?",384
ConceptScape: Collaborative Concept Mapping for Video Learning,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657199,"while video has become a widely adopted medium for online learning, existing video players provide limited support for navigation and learning. it is difficult to locate parts of the video that are linked to specific concepts. also, most video players afford passive watching, thus making it difficult for learners with limited metacognitive skills to deeply engage with the content and reflect on their understanding. to support concept-driven navigation and comprehension of lecture videos, we present conceptscape, a system that generates and presents a concept map for lecture videos. conceptscape engages crowd workers to collaboratively generate a concept map by prompting them to externalize reflections on the video. we present two studies to show that (1) interactive concept maps can be useful tools for concept-based video navigation and comprehension, and (2) with conceptscape, novice crowd workers can collaboratively generate complex concept maps that match the quality of those by experts. this paper presents conceptscape, a system that generates and presents a concept map for lecture videos. we introduce a crowdsourcing workflow to engage workers to collaboratively generate a concept map by prompting them to externalize reflections on the video. we evaluate our crowdsourcing workflow on mechanical turk. the result shows that crowd workers collaboratively generated concept maps that match the quality of those generated by experts. in addition, the flexible task design of the workflow promotes workers to contribute more than required, while they generally perceived performing the task to be helpful for learning. we also show that watching video with an interactive concept map can support concept-based video navigation and comprehension.",385
Expressive Time Series Querying with Hand-Drawn Scale-Free Sketches,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657190,"we present qetch, a tool where users freely sketch patterns on a scale-less canvas to query time series data without specifying query length or amplitude. we study how humans sketch time series patterns --- humans preserve visually salient perceptual features but often non-uniformly scale and locally distort a pattern --- and we develop a novel matching algorithm that accounts for human sketching errors. qetch enables the easy construction of complex and expressive queries with two key features: regular expressions over sketches and relative positioning of sketches to query multiple time-aligned series. through user studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of qetch's different interaction features. we also demonstrate the effectiveness of qetch's matching algorithm compared to popular algorithms on targeted, and exploratory query-by-sketch search tasks on a variety of data sets. in this paper, we introduced qetch, a query-by-sketch tool for time series data. we conducted a crowd study to learn how humans sketch time series. we observed that participants often preserve and exaggerate the visually salient features of the reference time series they are sketching. we designed qetch’s matching algorithm to consider and tolerate such distortions. as our evaluation demonstrates, qetch’s sketchcentric design is powerful and expressive: through sketch annotations, users can effectively construct complex regularexpression queries and queries over multiple time-aligned series. qetch outperforms standard algorithms on targeted and exploratory search tasks. finally, we publicly release our crowd-sourced data set of sketches and source code [34].",386
Prayana: Intermediated Financial Management in Resource-Constrained Settings,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657191,"we describe the design of a novel mobile phone-based application for loan management in a resource-constrained setting. in this setting, a social enterprise manages auto-rickshaw loans for drivers, taking charge of collections. the design was informed by an ethnographic study which revealed how loan management for this financially vulnerable population is a daily struggle, and loan payment is a collaborative achievement between collectors and drivers. however, drivers and collectors have limited resources to-hand for loan management. to address this, we designed prayana, an intermediated financial management app. prayana shares the principles of many persuasive technologies, such as education, motivation, and nudges, but is designed for users with a range of print, technical, and financial literacies and embodies the core design sensibility of enhancing users' agency. furthermore, it does not put the onus solely on drivers to better manage their money, instead it aims to enhance the collaborative work of loan management, supporting both the drivers and collectors. in many ways, twu represents the challenges typical to small business and ngos operating in low resource setting, including an ad hoc mixture of process and practice built up over time, limited resources to invest in technology, and a rapidly changing business model. we, therefore, believe that our design sensibilities - to support agency, rather than to control and direct; sensitivity to the problems of formalization, and the complexity/flexibility trade-off, and the use of technology for amplification rather than automation of human work - have a wider applicability. although not widely field tested yet, the design of prayana is deeply grounded in the findings of an ethnographic study and an iterative design process. at each stage of the design and user testing, we found improved understanding and ease of use by participants. furthermore, we have just started a field deployment and twu has transferred its entire collections (currently consisting of four collectors, eight community organizers and around 200 drivers) onto prayana, giving a clear indication of perceived benefit. this, and the fact that these methods have proved successful elsewhere [38], gives us confidence in the validity of our design. in future work, we will report on the results of the field trial, where we are collecting quantitative data (driver survey, payment data, use logs) and qualitative data (ethnographic observation of the system in use, including field agents and back office staff, interviews with drivers and their families, collectors and community organizers). finally, we hope to introduce a social competition for drivers and collectors, as well as to release a driver’s app for the increasing number of drivers with smartphones.",387
ChromaGlasses: Computational Glasses for Compensating Colour Blindness,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657192,"prescription glasses are used by many people as a simple, and even fashionable way, to correct refractive problems of the eye. however, there are other visual impairments that cannot be treated with an optical lens in conventional glasses. in this work we present chromaglasses, computational glasses using optical head-mounted displays for compensating colour vision deficiency. unlike prior work that required users to look at a screen in their visual periphery rather than at the environment directly, chromaglasses allow users to directly see the environment using a novel head-mounted displays design that analyzes the environment in real-time and changes the appearance of the environment with pixel precision to compensate the impairment of the user. in this work, we present first prototypes for chromaglasses and report on the results from several studies showing that chromaglasses are an effective method for managing colour blindness.",388
Face Value?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657193,"we are interested in increasing the ability of groups to collaborate efficiently by leveraging new advances in ai and conversational agent (ca) technology. given the longstanding debate on the necessity of embodiment for cas, bringing them to groups requires answering the questions of whether and how providing a ca with a face affects its interaction with the humans in a group. we explored these questions by comparing group decision-making sessions facilitated by an embodied agent, versus a voice-only agent. results of an experiment with 20 user groups revealed that while the embodiment improved various aspects of group's social perception of the agent (e.g., rapport, trust, intelligence, and power), its impact on the group-decision process and outcome was nuanced. drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss the pros and cons of embodiment, argue that the value of having a face depends on the types of assistance the agent provides, and lay out directions for future research. we revisited the longstanding debate on the necessity of embodiment for conversational agents in a new context–group facilitation. consistent with previous work, we showed that the embodiment improved various dimensions of subjective perceptions of the agent, but its effect on the objective task performance was less evident. however, in the group context, we found evidence that the embodiment had positive influence on group dynamics and invited more pro-active interactions. our qualitative results suggested these phenomenon could be potentially explained by an enhanced social presence of a agent continuously “being there”, more intuitive and pleasant interactions with multi-modalities, and higher task capabilities attributed to the more lifelike visual character. although the cost of developing additional modalities does not always justify the benefit of embodiment, we suggest that embodiment is a valuable feature for cas in collaborative contexts, especially when social influence such as rapport, trust and power is beneficial for the task, when the agent activities require continuous user attention, and when it involves collaboration and mixed-initiative interactions between human and the agent.",389
Coding Tactile Symbols for Phonemic Communication,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657194,"we present a study to examine one's learning and processing capacity of broadband tactile information, such as that derived from speech. in study 1, we tested a user's capability to recognize tactile locations and movements on the forearm in the presence of masking stimuli and determined 9 distinguishable tactile symbols. we associated these symbols to 9 phonemes using two approaches, random and articulation associations. study 2 showed that novice participants can learn both associations. however, performance for retention, construction of words and knowledge transfer to recognize unlearned words was better with articulation association. in study 3, we trained novel participants to directly recognize words before learning phonemes. our results show that novel users can retain and generalize the knowledge to recognize new words faster when they were directly train on words. finally, study 4 examined optimal presentation rate for the tactile symbols without compromising learning and recognition rate.",390
X-Ray Refine: Supporting the Exploration and Refinement of Information Exposure Resulting from Smartphone Apps,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657105,"most smartphone apps collect and share information with various first and third parties; yet, such data collection practices remain largely unbeknownst to, and outside the control of, end-users. in this paper, we seek to understand the potential for tools to help people refine their exposure to third parties, resulting from their app usage. we designed an interactive, focus-plus-context display called x-ray refine (refine) that uses models of over 1 million android apps to visualise a person's exposure profile based on their durations of app use. to support exploration of mitigation strategies, emphrefine can simulate actions such as app usage reduction, removal, and substitution. a lab study of emphrefine found participants achieved a high-level understanding of their exposure, and identified data collection behaviours that violated both their expectations and privacy preferences. participants also devised bespoke strategies to achieve privacy goals, identifying the key barriers to achieving them. many of the smartphone apps people see as vital to daily life have been—for various economic, technical, and social reasons—driven to share data to many third parties. some of this sharing is simply a side effect of functionality integration, whilst others are deliberate attempts to harvest information about people for purposes such as marketing or analytics. the essential challenge that the work presented in this paper addresses is the fact that people remain largely unaware of this network of entities with whom their apps are sharing data. in a world where cybersecurity breaches impact millions of people on a frequent basis, this work explores whether a greater awareness of such information sharing practices could help people articulate privacy goals, and to devise practical strategies to achieve them. evaluation of our interface prototype, x-ray refine, demonstrated that people could effectively and accurately deduce essential properties of their exposure from a visualisation of a privacy profile model, derived from simple static analysis of apps they used. participants used both focus and overview elements of the interactive visualisation, spending the most time viewing the effects of particular actions (adding, removing, adjusting duration of use, and substituting apps) on their exposure. during reflection, they provided a variety of viewpoints on what they felt about apps’ data collection activities and the companies behind them. most interestingly, people derived different strategies as they sought to achieve their idiosyncratic privacy goals. the diversity of such goals and the effectiveness with which these individuals came up with realistic strategies, highlights the potential advantages of our approach—and of interfaces, in general, that directly support user judgement and reasoning, through sensemaking, simulation, and mitigation affordances. we propose that such interfaces afford greater flexibility, transparency, and control than ai or recommender systems that take people out of the loop by making decisions for them. finally, our study found many promising avenues for further exploration. one idea was, for example, to support participants in understanding whether there were particular data protection regulations or frameworks in place in the jurisdictions where their data were held. another avenue for exploration involved helping people to easily make sense of the trustworthiness of third parties through a ‘data reputation score’ derived from their maturity and history of security incidents. we feel that this work has opened up a number of potentially fruitful lines of further investigation towards greater end-user awareness and control over their privacy.",391
Controlling Maximal Voluntary Contraction of the Upper Limb Muscles by Facial Electrical Stimulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657106,"in this paper, we propose to use facial electrical stimulation to control maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) of the upper limbs. the method is based on a body mechanism in which the contraction of the masseter muscles enhances mvc of the limb muscles. facial electrical stimulation is applied to the masseter muscles and the lips. the former is to enhance the mvc by causing involuntary contraction of the masseter muscles, and the latter is to suppress the mvc by interfering with voluntary contraction of the masseter muscles. in a user study, we used electromyography sensors on the upper limbs to evaluate the effects of the facial electrical stimulation on the mvc of the upper limbs. the experimental results show that the mvc was controlled by the facial electrical stimulation. we assume that the proposed method is useful for sports athletes because the mvc is linked to sports performance. we proposed a novel method to control maximal voluntary contraction (mvc) of the upper limb muscles by facial electrical stimulation. in the method, facial electrical stimulation is applied to the masseter muscles to enhance the mvc of the upper limb muscles by causing involuntary contraction of the masseter muscles, and to the lips to suppress the mvc by interference with voluntary contraction of the masseter muscles. the method aims to control the muscles of the whole body with a few electrodes placed on the face utilizing the body mechanism of human motor activity. we evaluated the method under the condition of isometric contraction of the upper limb muscles. the results showed that the involuntary contraction evoked by ems to the masseter muscles increased the mvc of the upper limb muscles, and the electrical stimulation to the lips interfered with the voluntary contraction of the masseter muscles. in future work, we will investigate the method’s feasibility under more complex motor activity conditions.",392
How to Design a Digital Storytelling Authoring Tool for Developing Pre-Reading and Pre-Writing Skills,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657107,"in the paper we describe an exploration into the design of an authoring tool to support the creation of multimedia stories. we explicitly targeted children with no reading or writing skills and their educators. children in this age group often enjoy reading and creating stories together with adults and in so doing develop important pre-literacy skills. literature suggests that when children play an active role in these activities, with a high level of engagement and interaction, there is a significant increase in their vocabulary acquisition and an improvement in their communication skills. thus, we investigated these issues by conducting an explorative study in a pre-school class with fifteen children and three teachers. here, we describe the emerging challenges and provide design directions for an authoring system to support the co-creation of stories for pre-literate children. literature indicates that pre-literate children can find a benefit in co-reading and co-creating stories with adults [18], with their peers [14]. indeed, the use of technology can amplify this experience and provide a concrete support in the development of language and communication skills [4]. in our explorative study, we considered this activity in a formal educational context, and the opportunities and challenges of designing an authoring tool for narrative skills development. the emerging challenges are described in order to inform the design process towards the implementation of a working prototype to be tested in preschools. other research projects addressed similar issues. for instance, q–tales [16] focuses on the co-creation of narrative stories with an educational flavour but outside the school environment. indeed, designing for and with schools’ stakeholders has many specific constraints as well as opportunities. the results of our study are somewhat limited by the small sample of subjects included and the curriculum, which is specific to this european country, switzerland.",393
"Non-Native English Speakers Learning Computer Programming: Barriers, Desires, and Design Opportunities",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657108,"people from nearly every country are now learning computer programming, yet the majority of programming languages, libraries, documentation, and instructional materials are in english. what barriers do non-native english speakers face when learning from english-based resources? what desires do they have for improving instructional materials? we investigate these questions by deploying a survey to a programming education website and analyzing 840 responses spanning 86 countries and 74 native languages. we found that non-native english speakers faced barriers with reading instructional materials, technical communication, reading and writing code, and simultaneously learning english and programming. they wanted instructional materials to use simplified english without culturally-specific slang, to use more visuals and multimedia, to use more culturally-agnostic code examples, and to embed inline dictionaries. programming also motivated some to learn english better and helped clarify logical thinking about natural languages. based on these findings, we recommend learner-centered design improvements to programming-related instructional resources and tools to make them more accessible to people around the world. this paper contributes, to our knowledge, the largest-scale qualitative investigation so far of human language on learning programming. by analyzing 840 survey responses spanning 86 countries and 74 native languages, we discovered a set of barriers faced by non-native english speakers (as reported by both native and non-native speakers), along with their desires for improving instructional materials. we then proposed learner-centered design ideas [37] for making instructional resources and tools more accessible to non-native english speakers. this work brings us closer to a future where the hopeful promise of computer science for all [53] broadens its scope to include people from all language backgrounds. more generally, programmers are a form of lead users [78] who are “ahead of the curve” in terms of willingness to both adopt and adapt existing resources to suit their needs. thus, designing for novice programmers could pave the way for making other creative technical skills more accessible to people from all sorts of language and cultural backgrounds. it is hard to predict exactly what new creative skills will be in demand in the coming decades, but making sure that they will be maximally accessible to a global audience will become even more important as the world grows more interconnected. by empowering more future creators from diverse backgrounds, the artifacts that end up being created will hopefully in turn become more representative of the needs of the world.",394
The Ambient Birdhouse: An IoT Device to Discover Birds and Engage with Nature,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657109,"we introduce the ambient birdhouse, a novel iot design for the home that seeks to encourage awareness and discovery of birds outside. people increasingly have routines and technologies that disconnect them from nature. moreover birds are hard to come to know, seen but not heard, heard but not seen, or simply around when we are not. the ambient birdhouse aims to reconcile these positions, by using local bird media to leverage people's playfulness and curiosity, calmly sustain interest over time and ultimately to garner interest and engagement in nature and conservation projects. we trialled the ambient birdhouse with five families. key findings are that the playful nature of the birdhouse has an immediate grasp on children, and through them on the rest of the family. children were prompt to learn bird calls, and invented and played games that involved the birdhouse. learning strategies emerged spontaneously from family routines and arrangements, with each family creating different moments and spaces for learning. this paper introduced a novel iot design for the home aimed at encouraging the discovery of birds, and through this, at fostering engagement in nature. the ambient birdhouse has been trialed with 5 families, and their insights and feedback have been gathered through interviews and a diary. our key findings showed how participants used the birdhouse as an opportunity to socialize, to share what they were learning and to discuss possible strategies for learning. the position in the home assigned to the birdhouse was determinant in shaping its use, as were the particular routines in which the birdhouse was integrated. participants offered many valuable suggestions as to what they may want to include in future versions of the birdhouse, and how they preferred to interact with it. the bird-cards were particularly well received, as children were able to invent new ways to play with them, and to involve their parents in those games. although assessing the learning outcomes was out of our scope, all participants noted that they were more alert to birds and more aware of their calls. they were more curious and keen to discover new ways of telling different species apart, and often took videos or pictures to share in their social networks to seek advice about a bird. children discussed the birdhouse with their friends at schools, and were keen to demonstrate it to grandparents on skype. we identified some key motivations that may be leveraged in the future to sustain engagement. parents were happy to have their children engaged with a technology that is safer that browsing the web or using social media, and is not isolating as a personal device. children were keen to appropriate the playful elements of the design in ways that matched their age, skills and interests. we offered three key implications for design of iot technologies for discovering and engaging with nature. we propose a novel perspective on gamification to embrace elements of play platforms, such as cards or bricks, rather than game elements such as leaderboards, in order to allow users to appropriate those elements into their own games. we propose to revisit probe and diary methods in the light of the great potentials of iot design, in order to embed in the future designs the tools for learning and self-reflection that are normally confined to the academic discourse, making them accessible to the users for a true participation in design research. we finally suggest to conceptualize iot technologies as catalysts of shared spaces for learning and socialization, rather than through the lens of their sensing and communicating capabilities, in order to foreground their potentials to foster engagement and discovery.",395
Pocket Skills: A Conversational Mobile Web App To Support Dialectical Behavioral Therapy,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657100,"mental health disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide. although evidence-based psychotherapy is effective, engagement from such programs can be low. mobile apps have the potential to help engage and support people in their therapy. we developed pocket skills, a mobile web app based on dialectical behavior therapy (dbt). pocket skills teaches dbt via a conversational agent modeled on marsha linehan, who developed dbt. we examined the feasibility of pocket skills in a 4-week field study with 73 individuals enrolled in psychotherapy. after the study, participants reported decreased depression and anxiety and increased dbt skills use. we present a model based on qualitative findings of how pocket skills supported dbt. pocket skills helped participants engage in their dbt and practice and implement skills in their environmental context, which enabled them to see the results of using their dbt skills and increase their self-efficacy. we discuss the design implications of these findings for future mobile mental health systems. we created pocket skills, a mobile web app designed to support dialectical behavioral therapy (dbt). pocket skills guides people through dbt education and skills practice via emarsha, a conversational agent modeled on marsha linehan, the developer of dbt. we conduced a 4-week field study of 73 participants to test the feasibility of using pocket skills to support dbt. after the study, all participants showed significant improvement in depression, anxiety, and dbt skills use. in addition, we contribute a model of how pocket skills supported dbt based on our qualitative analysis of open-ended questions in the exit survey. participants reported that pocket skills helped them engage both in the app and in dbt in general. this engagement helped them learn the principles and practice the skills in context, helping them implement those skills in their everyday lives. participants were therefore able to see the concrete results of implementing their dbt skills and improve their self-efficacy. we discussed the necessity of technology being available and engaging to support mental health treatment, as well as the importance of visualizing history and improvement, considering therapist needs, and supporting people without access to in-person therapy. this work therefore motivates future study, design, and development of tools to support mental health.",396
The Application and Its Consequences for Non-Standard Knowledge Work,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657101,"application-centric computing dominates human-computer interactions, yet the concept of an application is ambiguous and the impact of its ubiquity underexplored. we unpack ""the application"" through the lens of non-standard knowledge work: freelance, self-employed, and fixed-term contract workers who create knowledge in collaboration with a wide variety of stakeholders on a per-project basis. based on interviews with fourteen participants we describe how: i) their economic value is intertwined with data and skills related to specific applications; ii) their access to this value is systematically jeopardised in collaboration due to the different application practices, preferences, and proficiencies of other stakeholders; and iii) they mitigate the costs of this compromise through cross-application collaboration strategies. we trace these experiences to common characteristics of applications, such as update processes, interface symmetries, application-document relationships, and operating system and hardware dependencies. by empirically and analytically focusing on ""the application"", we reveal the implications of the current application-centric computing paradigm and discuss how variations within this model create qualitatively different human-computer interactions. the application represents a particular way of packaging interaction with computation. we explored how the common characteristics of applications reveal themselves through the problems and opportunities experienced by non-standard knowledge workers. we found how the economic value of these workers is tied up with the applications they use based on the skills and data they invest in them and how this relationship affects the efficient, effective, and enjoyable execution of their tasks. however, the technical tendencies of application-centric computing require non-standard knowledge workers to regularly abandon their preferred choice and instead switch to applications they are unfamiliar with or which change their ability to produce. at the same time, not all applications are identical and the extent and way in which users have to adapt can vary, based on the way the application relates to the document, different versions of the same application, other applications, and the operating system. the way application characteristics vary shows how they exist on a spectrum and how alternative models can create qualitatively different user experiences. given the central position of the application in our interaction with computation, empirically exploring the application-centric computing paradigm is imperative in order to further reveal what defines an application, how variations matter, and what alternatives are yet to be explored.",397
Digital Konditorei: Programmable Taste Structures using a Modular Mold,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657102,"digital gastronomy (dg) is a culinary concept that enhances traditional cooking with new hci capabilities, rather than replacing the chef with an autonomous machine. preliminary projects demonstrate implementation of dg via the deployment of digital instruments in a kitchen. here we contribute an alternative solution, demonstrating the use of a modular (silicone) mold and a genetic mold-arrangement algorithm to achieve a variety of shape permutations for a recipe, allowing the control of taste structures in the dish. the mold overcomes the slow production time of 3d food printing, while allowing for a high degree of flexibility in the numerous shapes produced. this flexibility enables us to satisfy chefs' and diners' diverse requirements. we present the mold's logic, arithmetic, design and special parts, the evolutionary algorithm, and a recipe, exploiting a new digital cooking concept of programmable edible taste structures and taste patterns to enrich user interaction with a given recipe. in this work we contribute a new procedure to the growing body of dg research and developments, to allow chefs to program the taste of food, enabling for local computational control of taste. we propose to use a modular mold to cast edible substances. by using a mold with a large number of shape permutations, we accelerate the 3d forming stage compared to food printing: while it can take hours to print a shape with an edible paste, casting the same shape is immediate. yet we are aware that after casting we still need to stabilize the liquid substance, which may take significant time, depending on the method. for example, we demonstrate the use of a modular mold with a mousse recipe, which needs to be fully frozen to stabilize and solidify it. although this takes time, there are methods to accelerate the process, such as using liquid nitrogen that we did not explore in detail.",398
Exploring the Weak Association between Flow Experience and Performance in Virtual Environments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657103,"many studies conducted in non-virtual activities have shown that flow significantly influences performance, yet studies in virtual activities often reveal only a weak association. this paper begins by building a theoretical explanatory model, and then conducts 3 empirical studies to explore this question. study 1 exams the mechanism of weak association in two virtual activities. study 2 tests the effectiveness of a potential approach to strengthen this association. in study 3 we applied our proposed model and design approach to optimize a vr tennis game. results show that the influence of flow on performance was not significant in those virtual activities where the primary task and the operation of interactive artifacts were less congruent such that the artifacts can lead to flow experience that is independently of the primary task. our research offers a theoretical and empirical basis on how to optimize virtual environment design and maximize positive effect of the flow experience.",399
Understanding the Mundane Nature of Self-care: Ethnographic Accounts of People Living with Parkinson's,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657104,"self-care technologies have been influenced by medical values and models. one of the values that was acritically incorporated was that self-care was medicalised, and, as a result, technologies were designed to afford use with clinicians and fit structured medical processes. this paper seeks to broaden the understanding of self-care in hci, to acknowledge the mundane ways in which self-care is achieved. drawing on in-depth interviews with patients and carers, and online ethnography of an online community, we describe how the self-care of parkinson's is mundane. the fieldwork contrasts with more medicalised perspectives on self-care, thus we discuss the properties of a self-care concept that would acknowledge its mundane nature. our hope is to sensitise designers to identify the mundane ways in which self-care is performed and, consequently, design technologies that better fit the complexities of everyday life with a chronic condition. this paper presented the everyday practices of the self-care of parkinson’s. it was clear that numerous challenges of parkinson’s were mundane and related with the need to practically adapt to the condition. these findings question the common assumption that self-care equates with monitoring symptoms or performing treatment and thus point to the need of approaching self-care through a different lens. recognising the mundane nature of self-care entails understanding that performing self-care requires great work in organising and conducting activities. the activities are not isolated, but rather intertwined and deeply ingrained in the everyday life of specific people. also, as not everything is possible at the same time, self-care is the result of negotiations and compromises that are dynamically adjusted as needed to live a life with quality.",400
EDITalk: Towards Designing Eyes-free Interactions for Mobile Word Processing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657115,"we present editalk, a novel voice-based, eyes-free word processing interface. we used a wizard-of-oz elicitation study to investigate the viability of eyes-free word processing in the mobile context and to elicit user requirements for such scenarios. results showed that meta-level operations like highlight and comment, and core operations like insert, delete and replace are desired by users. however, users were challenged by the lack of visual feedback and the cognitive load of remembering text while editing it. we then studied a commercial-grade dictation application and discovered serious limitations that preclude comfortable speak-to-edit interactions. we address these limitations through editalk's closed-loop interaction design, enabling eyes-free operation of both meta-level and core word processing operations in the mobile context. finally, we discuss implications for the design of future mobile, voice-based, eyes-free word processing interface. editalk is designed to bridge the gap between the user’s need for mobile eyes-free interaction with text and limitations of using existing dictation applications in trying to achieve it. results show that editalk’s interaction design enables the user to achieve eyes-free word processing with high accuracy and precision levels. the prototype garnered positive feedback from all of our participants and demonstrated promising potential to design targeted solutions for specific user groups such as the visually impaired. we believe editalk has real potential to spur future work in the space of designing specialized eyesfree text interaction systems. this would be another step towards an exciting future in the conversational paradigm of user interactions.",401
Improving User Confidence in Concept Maps: Exploring Data Driven Explanations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657116,"automated tools are increasingly being used to generate highly engaging concept maps as an aid to strategic planning and other decision-making tasks. unless stakeholders can understand the principles of the underlying layout process, however, we have found that they lack confidence and are therefore reluctant to use these maps. in this paper, we present a qualitative study exploring the effect on users' confidence of using data-driven explanation mechanisms, by conducting in-depth scenario-based interviews with ten participants. to provide diversity in stimulus and approach we use two explanation mechanisms based on projection and agglomerative layout methods. the themes exposed in our results indicate that the data-driven explanations improved user confidence in several ways, and that process clarity and layout density also affected users' views of the credibility of the concept maps. we discuss how these factors can increase uptake of automated tools and affect user confidence. in this paper we report the effect of data-driven explanations on users’ confidence both in terms of their ability to understand, and explain, the layouts of automatically generated concept maps. to this aim we conducted a qualitative study using in-depth scenario-based interviews that exploited interactive, visual, explanations of constructive and reductive layout methods. during these interviews, participants used and discussed concept maps that were provided with and without our data-driven explanations. our participants reported having stronger confidence when they used the data-driven explanations, as they provide case-specific evidence and interactivity that allows both control over the explanation’s pacing and the ability to query the underlying evidence (r1 and r2). these results were further reinforced by a frequency analysis which showed that users were proportionately more positive when discussing data-driven explanation, than when commenting on concept map layouts on their own (58% vs. 21% respectively). the participants were also provided with two different types of explanation, one for each of the layout methods. the reductive approach was based upon standard projection methods, while the constructive approach was derived from a simple agglomerative clustering technique. our aim in providing these two methods was to enhance the diversity of the stimuli rather than perform a/b testing, as the latter would not be possible without confounding the effect of the two layout and explanation methods. the two different layout methods discussed above revealed two important design considerations that can affect the credibility of concept maps (r3 and r4). first, that layout density affects users’ perception of the clarity of the map, as it alters their ability to perceive structure (as dense packing prevents easy abstraction by users of concepts into groups). we therefore recommend that designers choose algorithms which provide variable packing densities so that they can trade screen real estate for the communication of structure and perceived clarity (r3). it should be noted that while our implementation of the agglomerative method produced dense maps in this study, this is not intrinsic to the method. in future work we plan to investigate different ways of communicating inherent structure within the map’s similarity data. second, the two types of stimuli exposed participants’ strong preference for agglomerative or constructive approaches as opposed to the reductive projective methods in which a complex problem is presented to users and then information is gradually discarded. in particular, the repeated aggregation of pairs of concepts into clusters in the first approach means that the user’s working memory is not overloaded, which we believe greatly contributes to users’ perception of simplicity and clarity (r4). to conclude, we believe this study also highlights the need to further understand and research the underlying issues that affect user confidence when generating various visualizations using automated tools for planning, decision-making and collaborative activities.",402
Spokespeople: Exploring Routes to Action through Citizen-Generated Data,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657117,"this paper presents insights from a collaboration with cycling advocates and local authorities to consider how hci can open productive spaces for citizens to contribute to the realization of social goals. we worked with members of a walking and cycling advocacy organization to explore the potential for technology-mediated data collection to support advocacy and action taking. based on our initial findings, we developed and deployed spokespeople-a system to enable people who cycle to collect, curate and make visible their everyday journeys and experiences. we then worked with participants, cycling advocates and local authority transport planners to explore how citizens can contribute beyond data collection, by curating and prioritizing their experiences and exploring possible routes to action. we identify future directions for technology design to support citizens to make meaningful contributions to changes in the city through annotated routes, prioritization and community commissioning processes. this paper covers three stages of our research working with cyclists, cycling advocacy organizations and local councils to explore how citizens can not only generate data but go on to use data to create meaningful change. we have presented spokespeople, a platform to enable cyclists to collect and curate situated journey and experiential data. we have also identified future directions for technology design to support citizens to make meaningful contributions to changes in the city. we introduce the idea of annotated routes that provide affordances for data curation, storytelling and data analysis. finally, we also explore design challenges and opportunities for technologies to support citizen participation in processes leading to action and change that go beyond data collection. we highlight supporting issue prioritization and community commissioning processes as promising areas for further research.",403
Evaluating the Disruptiveness of Mobile Interactions: A Mixed-Method Approach,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657118,"while the proliferation of mobile devices has rendered mobile notifications ubiquitous, researchers are only slowly beginning to understand how these technologies affect everyday social interactions. in particular, the negative social influence of mobile interruptions remains unexplored from a methodological perspective. this paper contributes a mixed-method evaluation procedure for assessing the disruptive impact of mobile interruptions in conversation. the approach combines quantitative eye tracking, qualitative analysis, and a simulated conversation environment to enable fast assessment of disruptiveness. it is intended to be used as a part of an iterative interaction design process. we describe our approach in detail, present an example of its use to study a new call declining technique, and reflect upon the pros and cons of our approach. this paper contributes a new mixed-method approach to measuring the disruptiveness of technology. our new approach uses eye tracking and semi-structured interviews in a generic conversation task to offer rapid, actionable insights for designing interaction techniques that may be used in conversations. we presented an example study where we investigated techniques for declining calls in a face-to-face conversation. we were able to revisit the conversation and draw conclusions from the participants’ behavior using video and audio recordings. using our approach enabled us to understand the impact of a new interaction technique on disruptiveness. eye tracking revealed a significant drop in time spent looking on the phone when using the new technique. interviews provided evidence for underlining social mechanics that affect disruptions. designing techniques beyond existing ones to study the influence of different interaction mechanisms on conversational engagement remains an important challenge. we are eager to see how future designs will explore the design space that we merely begin to understand. as we recognize that our study is constrained by the fact that it was conducted in a lab setting, we hope that using our approach will be complemented by other studies that use alternative methods such as in-the-wild deployments of new interaction techniques. we also believe that an ethnographic study of the social acceptability of smartphone interruptions in public settings such as cafés or libraries will produce interesting insights for design. we hope that our work will inspire further developments and the creation of enhanced evaluation methods for future interaction techniques.",404
Make Yourself at Phone: Reimagining Mobile Interaction Architectures With Emergent Users,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657119,"we present appropriate -- a novel mobile design to allow users to temporarily annex any android device for their own use. appropriate is a small, cheap storage pod, designed to be easily carried in a pocket or hidden within clothing. its purpose is simple: to hold a copy of the local content an owner has on their mobile, liberating them from carrying a phone, or allowing them to use another device that provides advantages over their own. picking up another device when carrying appropriate transfers all pertinent content to the borrowed device (using local no-cost wifi from the appropriate device), transforming it to give the impression that they are using their own phone. while appropriate is useful for a wide range of contexts, the design was envisaged through a co-design process with resource-constrained emergent users in three countries. lab studies and a subsequent deployment on participants' own devices identified key benefits of the approach in these contexts, including for security, resource sharing, and privacy. in many countries, having a mobile phone to-hand makes people feel safer [5]. in other places, however—for instance, in more resource-constrained settings—having a phone on one’s person can make someone more of a target for theft [23]. in this work we have developed and explored the concept of separating out notions of data and device. an overarching goal of our approach has been to allow the financially valuable component of a device (i.e., the phone hardware) to be disconnected from the personally valuable component (i.e., the data it holds). we have illustrated how the appropriate approach is particularly beneficial in emergent user contexts where device security has been well documented as being a pressing issue [8, 14, 22]. this was particularly evident during evaluations in kenya and south africa, where many participants were worried about potential theft of their devices (tables 1 and 2). here, appropriate was seen as a way to allow participants to leave their phone behind, but still have access to their data on-the-go. our studies also showed benefits of the approach for privacy, in particular when people share devices with others. participants were more likely to be concerned about privacy if they shared their device with other people. our results suggest that appropriate is a potential response to issues around privacy on shared devices – participants saw the approach as a privacy-preserving way to store content created using shared devices, and potentially safer than using on-device hiding strategies [36]. in all of our studies, participants also saw benefits of appropriate for sharing resources, both when consumables were exhausted (e.g., data, airtime, battery), and to take advantage of better features (e.g., camera, storage, screen). the general concept of separating out data and device is already prominent in mainstream computing thanks to the cloud computing revolution (e.g., synchronising documents between devices). in our view, however, this model is currently far from seamless when applied to the complete contents of a mobile device, and the appropriate design hints at an alternative approach.",405
Interactive Feedforward for Improving Performance and Maintaining Intrinsic Motivation in VR Exergaming,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657110,"exergames commonly use low to moderate intensity exercise protocols. their effectiveness in implementing high intensity protocols remains uncertain. we propose a method for improving performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation in high intensity vr exergaming. our method is based on an interactive adaptation of the feedforward method: a psychophysical training technique achieving rapid improvement in performance by exposing participants to self models showing previously unachieved performance levels. we evaluated our method in a cycling-based exergame. participants competed against (i) a self model which represented their previous speed; (ii) a self model representing their previous speed but increased resistance therefore requiring higher performance to keep up; or (iii) a virtual competitor at the same two levels of performance. we varied participants' awareness of these differences. interactive feedforward led to improved performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation even when participants were aware of the interventions, and was superior to competing against a virtual competitor. we proposed and evaluated interactive feedforward, a novel method to rapidly improve performance in a hiit cycling vr exergame. interactive feedforward is based on self competition against an improved self model of the player, such as a recording of previous gameplay. our empirical study suggests the following conclusions, which should be considered in light of the aforementioned limitations: 1. interactive feedforward can be effective in improving players’ performance while maintaining intrinsic motivation. 2. interactive feedforward can still work if players are aware of the increased challenge, i.e. it does not rely on deception. 3. interactive feedforward, and self competition in general, can be superior to competition against others, leading to higher performance, intrinsic motivation, flow and immersion. interactive feedforward holds promise as a new method in exergames, with potential applications and opportunities in promoting positive change in people’s exercise behaviour.",406
ARcadia: A Rapid Prototyping Platform for Real-time Tangible Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657111,"paper-based fabrication techniques offer powerful opportunities to prototype new technological interfaces. typically, paper-based interfaces are either static mockups or require integration with sensors to provide real-time interactivity. the latter can be challenging and expensive, requiring knowledge of electronics, programming, and sensing. but what if computer vision could be combined with prototyping domain-aware programming tools to support the rapid construction of interactive, paper-based tangible interfaces? we designed a toolkit called arcadia that allows for rapid, low-cost prototyping of tuis that only requires access to a webcam, a web browser, and paper. arcadia brings paper prototypes to life through the use of marker based augmented reality (ar). users create mappings between real-world tangible objects and different ui elements. after a crafting and programming phase, all subsequent interactions take place with the tangible objects. we evaluated arcadia in a workshop with 120 teenage girls and found that tangible ar technologies can empower novice technology designers to rapidly construct and iterate on their ideas. we have presented the design of a low-cost, toolkit for the rapid prototyping of real-time, interactive and tangible interfaces. arcadia enables this through its built-in support for common interface elements and semantics – buttons, sliders, and knobs – and event-based control of system behavior and adjustment of continuous parameters. we have shown through our initial evaluation that arcadia can be used productively by novice designers and programmers to create interactive musical prototypes in a short amount of time. we found that the workshop participants generally had ease in iteratively modifying their prototypes. in general, the resulting projects that the girls built would typically take hours and possibly days for even an experienced programmer to create. for example, the “happy birthday” ar piano, which was made over the course of 90 minutes by two firsttime programmers, would require the work of a much more experienced developer and would still likely take much longer to build. although the workshops demonstrated arcadia’s ease of use and ability for novices to construct interactive projects, due to space constraints and decisions we made at the beginning of the workshops the projects remained pretty limited in their functionality. projects only incorporated the use of on or off buttons and no sliders or knobs. in the future we would like to provide an easier way for participants to construct more complex table-top interfaces. in addition, many of the workshop participants expressed a desire to use arcadia for other projects beyond simple musical controllers.",407
Building Momentum: Scaling up Change in Community Organizations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657112,"addressing calls in sustainable hci to scale up our work in hci targeting sustainability, and the current knowledge gap of how to do this practically, we here present a qualitative study of 10 sustainability-oriented community organizations that are working to scale up their change making. they are all loosely connected to a local transition network, meaning that they are aiming at transforming current practices in society, through local and practical action, to meet challenges related to climate change. we wanted to know how they try to scale up their change making, and what role ict plays in enabling scaling up. the study contributes new insights about three stages of scaling up, in which ict plays different roles. we conclude with implications for hci for how to support community organizations in scaling up, while keeping values important for working toward a more resilient society. in this work, we have outlined how 10 sustainabilityoriented community organizations work trying to sustain and/or scale up their activities, aiming at creating change in society. we have looked at how they operate, the purpose and motivation behind their work, what obstacles they meet trying to achieve their goals, as well as what role ict plays in supporting and/or hindering them in their work. from what we have seen, these organizations are capable of many things, but it can be hard for them to scale up on their own, especially concerning ict use in supporting their work. they thus need to team up with others, including stakeholders with expertise in ict and design who truly respect their values and who are in it for the long run. if we in the hci community and society more broadly want to support the momentum that grass-roots are building up everywhere, we have a lot to offer that could help them scale up. however, scaling up needs to be more than just sharing resources; it needs to bring people together.",408
Mechanism Perfboard: An Augmented Reality Environment for Linkage Mechanism Design and Fabrication,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657113,"prototyping devices with kinetic mechanisms, such as automata and robots, has become common in physical computing projects. however, mechanism design in the early-concept exploration phase is challenging, due to the dynamic and unpredictable characteristics of mechanisms. we present mechanism perfboard, an augmented reality environment that supports linkage mechanism design and fabrication. it supports the concretization of ideas by generating the initial desired linkage mechanism from a real world movement. the projection of simulated movement within the environment enables iterative tests and modifications in real scale. augmented information and accompanying tangible parts help users to fabricate mechanisms. through a user study with 10 participants, we found that mechanism perfboard helped the participant to achieve their desired movement. the augmented environment enabled intuitive modification and fabrication with an understanding of mechanical movement. based on the tool development and the user study, we discuss implications for mechanism prototyping with augmented reality and computational support. our motivation for conducting this research was that there are many difficulties in the linkage mechanism fabrication process and it is difficult for non-experts, who lack knowledge of and experience with mechanism design, to employ it. in this paper, we have presented an augmented reality environment and a top-down approach with a novel movement input interface that enables non-experts to design and fabricate linkage mechanisms with ease. also, we explored how the features of mechanism perfboard, including computational support, augmented reality, and a fabrication guide, could be involved with the linkage mechanism fabrication process. we expect this research to inspire the development of tools for kinetic mechanisms, as well as systems that use augmented reality and computational support.",409
Addressing Age-Related Bias in Sentiment Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657114,"computational approaches to text analysis are useful in understanding aspects of online interaction, such as opinions and subjectivity in text. yet, recent studies have identified various forms of bias in language-based models, raising concerns about the risk of propagating social biases against certain groups based on sociodemographic factors (e.g., gender, race, geography). in this study, we contribute a systematic examination of the application of language models to study discourse on aging. we analyze the treatment of age-related terms across 15 sentiment analysis models and 10 widely-used glove word embeddings and attempt to alleviate bias through a method of processing model training data. our results demonstrate that significant age bias is encoded in the outputs of many sentiment analysis algorithms and word embeddings. we discuss the models' characteristics in relation to output bias and how these models might be best incorporated into research. this paper systematically compares a number of popular and diverse sentiment tools, with respect to age-related bias. we find significant age-related bias among a variety of tools and commonly-used word embeddings and successfully reduce bias in a custom-built classifier. while we provide a first step in understanding how the technical characteristics of sentiment algorithms affect bias and identify one technique for reducing bias, our analysis is not exhaustive. future work should consider additional characteristics of algorithmic models, such as the type of classifier implemented and richer model parameters. further, researchers should consider the unique challenges of using computational techniques such as sentiment analysis to study underrepresented groups and social movements. as the “new power brokers in society,” [22] algorithms affect many aspects of life, including hiring, social policy, and finance; all of which are domains where age discrimination is common. in addition to understanding social bias in algorithms, we can use them as a lens to understand how unrecognized social bias operates at scale.",410
Identification of Imminent Suicide Risk Among Young Adults using Text Messages,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657125,"suicide is the second leading cause of death among young adults but the challenges of preventing suicide are significant because the signs often seem invisible. research has shown that clinicians are not able to reliably predict when someone is at greatest risk. in this paper, we describe the design, collection, and analysis of text messages from individuals with a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors to build a model to identify periods of suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation and non-fatal suicide attempts). by reconstructing the timeline of recent suicidal behaviors through a retrospective clinical interview, this study utilizes a prospective research design to understand if text communications can predict periods of suicidality versus depression. identifying subtle clues in communication indicating when someone is at heightened risk of a suicide attempt may allow for more effective prevention of suicide. our study was designed to investigate temporally sensitive patterns in communication that predict acute suicidal thoughts and behaviors. by comparing communication patterns during periods immediately preceding a suicide attempt and periods of high ideation versus depression but non-suicidal periods of their life, we aim to isolate specific communication that characterizes acute suicide risk. this research provides evidence that language changes as an individual transitions from depression to suicidality (i.e., suicidal ideation and non-fatal suicide attempts), indicating an increasing level of suicide risk. future research should explore whether individualizing the models produces better performance that is calibrated to an individual’s specific expression of language during increasing risk states. although depression is a risk factor for suicide, research indicates that only 2-8% of individuals with a mood disorder will go on to kill themselves [2]. therefore, depression in itself is not clinically useful for identifying high-risk individuals. further, even if known risk factors are used to indicate high risk individuals, they cannot tell us when such individuals are at particularly elevated risk. employing data-driven techniques, such as those developed in this study, could identify when individuals are at heightened risk and help direct appropriate resources to these individuals. as nock et al. [29] report,“the biggest shortcoming in suicide research to date” is “the inability to dramatically decrease rates of suicidal behavior and mortality despite decades of research and associated commitment of resources.” this research may enable new ways to identify not just who is at risk for a suicide attempt, but also when a given person increases in their risk state and acutely needs services.",411
Touch Your Heart: A Tone-aware Chatbot for Customer Care on Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657126,"chatbot has become an important solution to rapidly increasing customer care demands on social media in recent years. however, current work on chatbot for customer care ignores a key to impact user experience - tones. in this work, we create a novel tone-aware chatbot that generates toned responses to user requests on social media. we first conduct a formative research, in which the effects of tones are studied. significant and various influences of different tones on user experience are uncovered in the study. with the knowledge of effects of tones, we design a deep learning based chatbot that takes tone information into account. we train our system on over 1.5 million real customer care conversations collected from twitter. the evaluation reveals that our tone-aware chatbot generates as appropriate responses to user requests as human agents. more importantly, our chatbot is perceived to be even more empathetic than human agents. in this paper, we first systematically study the effects of agent tones in customer care. two tones that are beneficial for increasing user experience – passionate and empathetic – are identified accordingly. we further propose a novel deep learning based chatbot for customer care that integrates the tone information in conversations, and generates toned responses to user requests. the evaluation results suggest that our system could generate as appropriate responses as human agents. meanwhile, the the tones embedded can be easily perceived by annotators. more importantly, it is observed that the responses generated by our system is perceived more empathetic than responses by human agents. there are many interesting and valuable directions for future work. possible directions include studying the effects of agent tones at a finer granularity, and how the chatbot could effect the end user engagement. meanwhile, it is also worth studying the possible extensions on our proposed model, such as a brand-aware chatbot for different brand styles.",412
Modern Bereavement: A Model for Complicated Grief in the Digital Age,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657127,"the experience of grief and death is an inevitable part of life. grief, a natural response to death, can be a challenging and emotionally taxing journey. bereaved individuals often feel lost in a fog, unaware of resources available to them and unsure of which resources could be useful for supporting their healing process. complicated grief, a more intense form of grief that extends beyond six months following the death of a loved one, presents both a unique challenge and a design opportunity for the hci community. in this work, we present the results of a survey and interview study on the technological practices of complicated grievers. based on themes found in the data, we propose a new model for complicated grief in the digital age, consisting of the following phases: fog, isolation, exploration, immersion, and stabilization. we then present a set of design considerations for designers seeking to create tools for complicated grievers navigating their unique grief journeys. this work provides an in-depth look into how the bereaved navigate their grief in an increasingly digital world. we have introduced a behavioral model of the bereavement journey, compared online and offline grief support groups and examined the transitions the bereaved make between these support systems, and presented implications for designing systems that support the bereavement journey. in particular, we have reviewed the risk of the grief loop, and how online support groups can, if not designed carefully, contribute to prolonged suffering in bereavement. these portraits of modern grief that we have presented are by no means comprehensive. a common refrain that we heard over and over from our participants is that “everyone grieves differently”. the hci community should heed this message and work to design technologies which respect the individualized nature of the bereavement journey. at the same time, we must provide avenues for the bereaved to connect with similar others and grow together in community. through these efforts, we can equip grieving individuals with the tools they need to cope with their loss in the way that best fits their unique situation and goals.",413
Using Animation to Alleviate Overdraw in Multiclass Scatterplot Matrices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657128,"the scatterplot matrix (splom) is a commonly used technique for visualizing multiclass multivariate data. however, multiclass sploms have issues with overdraw (overlapping points), and most existing techniques for alleviating overdraw focus on individual scatterplots with a single class. this paper explores whether animation using flickering points is an effective way to alleviate overdraw in these multiclass sploms. in a user study with 69 participants, we found that users not only performed better at identifying dense regions using animated sploms, but also found them easier to interpret and preferred them to static sploms. these results open up new directions for future work on alleviating overdraw for multiclass sploms, and provide insights for applying animation to alleviate overdraw in other settings. multiclass sploms are one of hardest and least studied settings for dealing with overdraw, and there are not yet studies examining how well animation alleviates overdraw. our work is a first step to remedying that. specifically, we provide and demonstrate an interactive web-based tool capable of rendering of over a million points. we then studied the impact of animation on the simplest of encodings with a 69-participant user study. participants performed better with the animated sploms, found them easier to interpret and not too distracting, and preferred animated versus static sploms.",414
The Context of College Students' Facebook Use and Academic Performance: An Empirical Study,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657129,"the effects of facebook on academic performance have attracted both public and scholarly attention. prior research found that facebook use is linked to poor academic performance, suggesting that facebook distracts students from studying. these studies, which are primarily based on survey responses, are insufficient to uncover exactly how facebook is used or embedded in students' studying activities. to capture unbiased, detailed use patterns and to investigate the context of facebook use, we studied 50 college students using automatic logging and experience sampling. we analyzed the activities and attentional states of students prior to visiting facebook. results show that gpas of frequent facebook users do not suffer. students with high gpas spend shorter time in each facebook session and shorter facebook use often follows schoolwork. these results point to a possibility that potentially problematic facebook use occurs when students are in a spree of leisure activities, not while studying. though past studies generally point to a negative relationship between facebook use and academic performance, our study has provided evidence that the relationship is far more nuanced. using more precise measures of facebook use than previous studies, we found that people who check facebook frequently are no different in academic performance than those who check infrequently. the difference between high and low performing students appears to be in how facebook is used each time. low gpa students spend longer time in each use and facebook use that follows leisure activities tend to be longer in duration. further research is needed to understand more clearly why some students engage in brief facebook use while others engage in prolonged use. we have suggested some directions, such as alertness and selfregulation. we have also suggested a new direction for the future investigation of social media use and academic performance in college life: examining facebook use in leisure time.",415
"Designing Consistent Gestures Across Device Types: Eliciting RSVP Controls for Phone, Watch, and Glasses",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657120,"in the era of ubiquitous computing, people expect applications to work across different devices. to provide a seamless user experience it is therefore crucial that interfaces and interactions are consistent across different device types. in this paper, we present a method to create gesture sets that are consistent and easily transferable. our proposed method entails 1) the gesture elicitation on each device type, 2) the consolidation of a unified gesture set, and 3) a final validation by calculating a transferability score. we tested our approach by eliciting a set of user-defined gestures for reading with rapid serial visual presentation (rsvp) of text for three device types: phone, watch, and glasses. we present the resulting, unified gesture set for rsvp reading and show the feasibility of our method to elicit gesture sets that are consistent across device types with different form factors. each type of device has its own means for input and output, which poses challenges to the consistency of interactions. many applications are expected to work across different device types, which is why interactions need to be increasingly designed so that they are consistent and therefore easily transferable. in this paper, we demonstrate the creation of a unified gesture set that follows a user-defined elicitation approach and takes into account the transferability of gesture sets across different device types. by eliciting gesture sets for controlling reading via rsvp on wearable devices, we present the resulting gesture set for phone, watch, and glasses along with a method to design for and assess consistency. while the proposed transferability score describes the ease of transferring a gesture set from one device to another, the consistency score is a metric for a the overall goodness of a cross-device gesture set. by applying these metrics and following the three steps of 1) elicitation, 2) consolidation, and 3) validation, application designers are given a method to design, evaluate, and compare user-defined gesture sets that are consistent and easily transferable across devices with different form factors.",416
Supporting the Complex Social Lives of New Parents,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657121,"one of the many challenges of becoming a parent is the shift in one's social life. as hci researchers have begun to investigate the intersection of sociotechnical system design and parenthood, they have also sought to understand how parents' social lives can be best supported. we build on these strands of research through a qualitative study with new parents regarding the role of digital technologies in their social lives as they transition to parenthood. we demonstrate how sociotechnical systems are entangled in the ways new parents manage their relationships, build (or resist building) new friendships and ad hoc support systems, and navigate the vulnerabilities of parenthood. we discuss how systems designed for new parents can better support the vulnerabilities they internalize, the diverse friendships they desire, and the logistical challenges they experience. we conclude with recommendations for future design and research in this area. in this paper, we have provided further insight into the technological support needs of new parents, building upon previous research into the difficulties individuals experience as they transition to parenthood. through extensive qualitative engagement, we have identified several areas where technological support is needed, particularly as governments reduce funding for social support. our analysis of these areas provides multiple opportunities for future technological innovations that build on these known barriers that parents experience, foregrounding aspects of interpersonal care and vulnerability that are important in building and maintaining parenting relationships.",417
Algorithmic Anxiety and Coping Strategies of Airbnb Hosts,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657122,"algorithms increasingly mediate how work is evaluated in a wide variety of work settings. drawing on our interviews with 15 airbnb hosts, we explore the impact of algorithmic evaluation on users and their work practices in the context of airbnb. our analysis reveals that airbnb hosts engage in a double negotiation on the platform: they must negotiate efforts not just to attract potential guests but also to appeal to only partially transparent evaluative algorithms. we found that a perceived lack of control and uncertainty over how algorithmic evaluation works can create anxiety among some airbnb hosts. we present a framework for understanding this double negotiation, as well as a case study of coping strategies that hosts employ to deal with their anxiety. we conclude with a discussion of design solutions that can help reduce algorithmic anxiety and increase confidence in algorithmic systems. software algorithms are increasingly changing how work is evaluated in an ever growing number of fields. in this paper, we explore the impact of algorithmic evaluation on workers in the context of airbnb. our findings from a qualitative study reveal the paradox of algorithmic transparency, and the resultant challenges in designing human-centered algorithmic evaluation systems. algorithms are in the foreground as well as the background of different platforms. they are increasingly explicit actors in online systems but also pervasive background actors that are hard for many users to name or point out. this suggests a shift where it is not just other humans on one hand and information systems on the other, but a middle layer of seeming-human judgment and decision-making, done by algorithms, which demands more study. we argue that it is critical for designers and researchers to pay more attention to this layer especially as algorithms, ml and ai become pervasive parts of sociotechnical systems. in this paper, we discuss opportunities for designing systems that address algorithmic anxiety and foster trust between the users and the systems. we hope this work inspires future research into the impact of algorithmic evaluation on workers in other contexts.",418
More Text Please! Understanding and Supporting the Use of Visualization for Clinical Text Overview,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657123,"clinical practice is heavily reliant on the use of unstructured text to document patient stories due to its expressive and flexible nature. however, a physician's capacity to recover information from text for clinical overview is severely affected when records get longer and time pressure increases. data visualization strategies have been explored to aid in information retrieval by replacing text with graphical summaries, though often at the cost of omitting important text features. this causes physician mistrust and limits real-world adoption. this work presents our investigation into the role and use of text in clinical practice, and reports on efforts to assess the best of both worlds---text and visualization---to facilitate clinical overview. we report on insights garnered from a field study, and the lessons learned from an iterative design process and evaluation of a text-visualization prototype, medstory, with 14 medical professionals. the results led to a number of grounded design recommendations to guide visualization design to support clinical text overview. clinical text overview is a challenging problem, to which data visualization has significant room to contribute. in this work, we presented a broad and extensive investigation into this question, via an iterative design approach. our activities included (a) an initial grounding from a formative phase, based on a multidisciplinary literature review and insights from field studies that led to a list of preliminary design goals; (b) the design, development and evaluation of medstory, a tool we designed to help assess the design principles we derived, and (c) reflections on the design of text-centered visualizations for clinical overview, reframing our initial design goals as a list of design recommendations for visualization-based systems to support clinical overview. there are also a number of relevant extensions and parallel investigations spanning from this work that have not been mentioned in the scope of our design reflections. first, extending our assessment to include other medical specialties would be an important step towards generality, as we have found some significant variations in work styles across formations. collaboration is another relevant aspect to look into, as patient care traditionally involves coordination among several care providers, within and across specialties. from a design perspective, it would also be interesting to look at how this text-driven visualization approach can encompass the heterogeneity of the medical record to seamlessly incorporate data such as structured tables (e.g., labs) and medical imaging to the core text narrative. ultimately, we believe there is significant room for future investigations—to which this work is an important but only initial step— and we hope to see further exploration on the topic.",419
"The SelfReflector: Design, IoT and the High Street",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657124,"we describe the design of selfreflector an internet-connected mirror that uses online facial recognition to estimate your age and play music from when it thinks you were 14 years old. the mirror was created for a specific shop (spex pistols optical boutique), within a research through design project centered on the high street as a space of vital social, economic and environmental exchange that offers a myriad of psychosocial support for people beyond a place to purchase goods. we present in detail how the design emerged as our research interests developed related to iot and how people use the high street to experiment with, and support sense of self. we discuss selfreflector in relation to challenges for iot, facial recognition and surveillance technologies, mirrorness and the values of a craft approach to designing technology centering on the nature of the bespoke and 'one-off'. our contributions through this paper are firstly selfreflector as an innovative digital artifact, secondly a detailed description of the design process which opened up and shared much reflective thought and action through the conceptualization and making of the piece, thirdly timely reflections, on resonant issues in design and hci, enabled by the process of designing and making selfreflector. through the discussion sections we offer perspectives on: challenges to designing for iot; limitations and inequalities to facial recognition algorithms and what this implies for iot design and research; mirrorness as a very particular, intimate quality to reflective artifacts and the potential of this for supporting self; the merits of single function objects; the value of the bespoke and one-off; and finally the three-fold proposition for iot on the high street represented by selfreflector.",420
Co-constructing Family Memory: Understanding the Intergenerational Practices of Passing on Family Stories,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657135,"sharing family stories is an integral aspect of how families remember together and build a sense of connection. yet, when generations in families are separated by large geographic and temporal distances, the everyday taken-for-granted processes of sharing family stories shift from conversational to mediated forms. to inform hci research and practice in mediating family stories, we contribute an account of the co-constructive intergenerational social practices enacted to co-construct and interpret family stories. these practices demonstrate the agency of both storytellers and listeners as they work to discover, decipher, and reconstruct family stories. we close by drawing insights from this setting to frame key design challenges for multi-lifespan information systems mediating asynchronous, asymmetric, co-constructive and socially weighted information sharing interactions. in this paper, we contributed a detailed account of the intergenerational practices involved in passing on family memory across generations through family stories. these practices are critical components of families’ processes of coming to a shared understanding of the past. we described how family stories are collectively co-constructed by family members in fluid roles of storytellers and active listeners working to discover, decipher and reconstruct family stories. we also identify strategies and challenges that family members face when conveying life experiences, life lessons, and historical information through family stories. in our discussion, we proposed opportunities for the design of multi-lifespan information systems to account for multiple contributors, to facilitate sharing with unknown listeners, and to preserve interpretive context over time. these findings and analysis provide an important foundation for understanding and developing for human values in socio-temporal settings.",421
Seismo: Blood Pressure Monitoring using Built-in Smartphone Accelerometer and Camera,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657136,"although cost-effective at-home blood pressure monitors are available, a complementary mobile solution can ease the burden of measuring bp at critical points throughout the day. in this work, we developed and evaluated a smartphone-based bp monitoring application called textitseismo. the technique relies on measuring the time between the opening of the aortic valve and the pulse later reaching a periphery arterial site. it uses the smartphone's accelerometer to measure the vibration caused by the heart valve movements and the smartphone's camera to measure the pulse at the fingertip. the system was evaluated in a nine participant longitudinal bp perturbation study. each participant participated in four sessions that involved stationary biking at multiple intensities. the pearson correlation coefficient of the blood pressure estimation across participants is 0.20-0.77 ($mu$=0.55, $sigma$=0.19), with an rmse of 3.3-9.2 mmhg ($mu$=5.2, $sigma$=2.0). seismo is a smartphone-based blood pressure monitoring technique that uses the built-in accelerometer to measure scg and the smartphone’s camera to measure ppg, in order to calculate pulse transit time to estimate blood pressure. in our evaluation with nine participants, we observed that two participants exhibited signals that were too noisy for our system to produce consistent scg signals. further investigation into different positioning of the phone may improve the motion artifacts that occur due to someone’s hand shaking. for participants with a weaker heart beat and more fat and muscle tissues between the accelerometer and the heart impedes the transduction of the scg. in this case, the high noise floor of the built-in accelerometer suffered in acquisition of the scg. of the seven participants that produced clean scg and ppg signals for further analysis, we found the group correlation to be between 0.20-0.77 with a mean of 0.55. although this result is a bit lower than prior work that uses similar signal source to infer pulse transit time, upon further investigation, we noted that the participant with the lowest correlation exhibited unexpected reference blood pressure measurements. for this participant, even though their pulse transit time decreased with respect to increase biking effort, their blood pressure did not follow the expected trend of increasing with increased effort. when we look at the group correlation without the worst correlated subject, the correlation becomes 0.61, comparable with most of the related work. through this evaluation, we show that the built-in sensors of a smartphone can acquire high quality signals for use in pulse transit time based blood pressure monitoring, while also revealing some of the short comings and improvements that can potentially mitigate them.",422
Jetto: Using Lateral Force Feedback for Smartwatch Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657137,"interacting with media and games is a challenging user experience on smartwatches due to their small screens. we propose using lateral force feedback to enhance these experiences. when virtual objects on the smartwatch display visually collide or push the edge of the screen, we add haptic feedback so that the user also feels the impact. this addition creates the illusion of a virtual object that is physically hitting or pushing the smartwatch, from within the device itself. using this approach, we extend virtual space and scenes into a 2d physical space. to create realistic lateral force feedback, we first examined the minimum change in force magnitude that is detectable by users in different directions and weight levels, finding an average jnd of 49% across all tested conditions, with no significant effect of weight and force direction. we then developed a proof-of-concept hardware prototype called jetto and demonstrated its unique capabilities through a set of impact-enhanced videos and games. our preliminary user evaluations indicated the concept was welcomed and is regarded as a worthwhile addition to smartwatch output and media experiences. our work introduces a smartwatch that uses lateral force feedback to enrich gaming and video experiences. we discussed the design space of this type of force feedback and its influence on human perception. through a controlled experiment (jnd study), we first investigated the minimum change in force magnitude that can be detected by users, focusing on weight and force direction. our results revealed the jnd of force magnitudes is 49% across all tested conditions, with no significant effect of weight and force direction. these results can provide useful insights for designers creating and using lateral force feedback on smartwatches. to demonstrate technical feasibility, we created a proof-of-concept prototype, composed of a small 3.5” tft display and a pneumatic system, capable of generating thrust forces by emitting a jet of air. the orientation and location of the nozzle along the edge of the screen is controlled using several miniature motors. finally, to demonstrate the capabilities of jetto, we developed a set of games and videos on the device and evaluated them in a preliminary user study. our results showed that our proposed lateral force feedback is a meaningful addition to smartwatch media experiences and output techniques.",423
ExtVision: Augmentation of Visual Experiences with Generation of Context Images for a Peripheral Vision Using Deep Neural Network,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657138,"we propose a system, called extvision, to augment visual experiences by generating and projecting context-images onto the periphery of the television or computer screen. a peripheral projection of the context-image is one of the most effective techniques to enhance visual experiences. however, the projection is not commonly used at present, because of the difficulty in preparing the context-image. in this paper, we propose a deep neural network-based method to generate context-images for peripheral projection. a user study was performed to investigate the manner in which the proposed system augments traditional visual experiences. in addition, we present applications and future prospects of the developed system. we have described two methods using dnn to generate peripheral context-images for videos and have presented our results. with our methods, a patch size of 256 × 256 pixels allows the most natural reconstruction of images (i.e., the discriminator should see the images globally in the contextimage generating task). our methods can generate textured images as fine as the multiscale method [1] keeping processing speed faster than 30 fps, which is sufficient for real-time generation of videos at 30 fps. our user study showed the peripherally projected images generated by our methods are sufficient for a positive enhancement of visual experiences. however, sequenced images generated by our methods have a flicker and noise problems caused by differences between frames. problems on the versatility of model and consideration of temporal changes also remain. to solve these problems, further optimization of the network for our task will be useful. we expect not only our research but also that dnn will make a further contribution to hci.",424
Substituting Motion Effects with Vibrotactile Effects for 4D Experiences,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657139,"in this paper, we present two methods to substitute motion effects using vibrotactile effects in order to improve the 4d experiences of viewers. this work was motivated by the needs of more affordable 4d systems for individual users. our sensory substitution algorithms convert motion commands to vibrotactile commands to a grid display that uses multiple actuators. while one method is based on the fundamental principle of vestibular feedback, the other method makes use of intuitive visually-based mapping from motion to vibrotactile stimulation. we carried out a user study and could confirm the effectiveness of our substitution methods in improving 4d experiences. to our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated the feasibility of replacing motion effects using much simpler and less expensive vibrotactile effects. in this paper, we have explored effective ways to convert motion effects to vibrotactile effects on a grid display in order to improve the viewers’ 4d experiences. we designed two substitution algorithms, one based on the principle of vestibular feedback and the other emphasizing intuitive match between visual and vibrotactile stimuli. a user study demonstrated the high potential of our methods, supporting the general applicability of our sensory substitution approach. as a next step, we consider two main tasks. one is to further improve our substitution algorithms, e.g., by combining the position-based rules with the derivative-based rules. the other is to compare the subjective performance of vibrotactile and motion effects as a way to gauge how much sensory substitution actually takes place with vibrotactile effects.",425
Communicating Awareness and Intent in Autonomous Vehicle-Pedestrian Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657130,"drivers use nonverbal cues such as vehicle speed, eye gaze, and hand gestures to communicate awareness and intent to pedestrians. conversely, in autonomous vehicles, drivers can be distracted or absent, leaving pedestrians to infer awareness and intent from the vehicle alone. in this paper, we investigate the usefulness of interfaces (beyond vehicle movement) that explicitly communicate awareness and intent of autonomous vehicles to pedestrians, focusing on crosswalk scenarios. we conducted a preliminary study to gain insight on designing interfaces that communicate autonomous vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. based on study outcomes, we developed four prototype interfaces and deployed them in studies involving a segway and a car. we found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a combination of modalities such as visual, auditory, and physical. we proposed the use of interfaces for explicitly communicating vehicle awareness and intent to pedestrians. as part of our exploration, we conducted a design study to gain insight on designing interfaces for autonomous vehicle-pedestrian interactions. we implemented the design study findings by creating four prototypes and deploying them on a segway and a car, and conducting two user studies to assess their usefulness in helping pedestrians make crossing decisions. we found that interfaces which communicate awareness and intent can be helpful to pedestrians attempting to cross a street. in summary, our work makes three contributions: (i) showing that autonomous vehicle interfaces that explicitly communicate vehicle awareness and intent can be helpful to pedestrians in making crossing decisions, (ii) identifying a preliminary design space that can aid future designers build interfaces that explicitly communicate awareness and intent, and (iii) presenting (in the discussion section) considerations for designing future interfaces that can help pedestrians interact with autonomous vehicles. we plan to expand our work and prototypes to testing with an actual autonomous vehicle, and to deployment on pedestrian’s mobile and wearable devices. we are also interested in testing our work with multiple vehicles and pedestrians where we predict that scalability will become a critical challenge. by revisiting our design space in different scaling conditions such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-tomany instances of vehicles and pedestrians, we can refine our findings to reflect scalability. our work has focused on the pedestrian-centered approach to handling the autonomous vehicle-pedestrian interaction, but there are also challenges in the driver-centered approach, such as maintaining driver situational awareness, which need to be addressed. further, we can learn from research being conducted in vehicle-to-vehicle communication. for example, sadigh et al. [26] propose using an autonomous vehicle’s actions to communicate awareness and intent to drivers of manually-driven vehicles. the near future will force pedestrians to expand their view of vehicles, a future where they will not expect the driver (if there is one) to provide them with familiar cues. other variables impacting future design of vehicle-pedestrian interfaces are expected to emerge from new policies governing the introduction of autonomous vehicles (such as the us department of transportation’s recent framework 6 ). while still preliminary, our work outlines a future path forward where the interaction flow to the pedestrian is shifting from the driver to the autonomous vehicle, and possibly drifting from static infrastructure (such as crosswalks and traffic lights) to vehicle interfaces and to the pedestrian’s mobile appliances. our findings suggest that expecting pedestrians to rely on cues provided by movement alone will be an oversight, and that future interfaces for autonomous vehicle-pedestrian communication are an acute challenge for the interaction design community.",426
Running Out of Time: The Impact and Value of Flexibility in On-Demand Crowdwork,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657131,"with a seemingly endless stream of tasks, on-demand labor markets appear to offer workers flexibility in when and how much they work. this research argues that platforms afford workers far less flexibility than widely believed. a large part of the ""inflexibility"" comes from tight deadlines imposed on tasks, leaving workers little control over their work schedules. we experimentally examined the impact of offering workers control of their time in on-demand crowdwork. we found that granting higher ""in-task flexibility"" dramatically affected the temporal dynamics of worker behavior and produced a larger amount of work with similar quality. in a second experiment, we measured the compensating differential and found that workers would give up significant compensation to control their time, indicating workers attach substantial value to in-task flexibility. our results suggest that designing tasks which give workers direct control of their time within tasks benefits both buyers and sellers of on-demand crowdwork. flexibility has long been assumed to be a key feature and benefit of on-demand crowdwork. this paper questions this common perception by examining whether there is sufficient flexibility in on-demand crowdwork and what it might mean to design in-task flexibility into on-demand work. our study suggests that higher levels of flexibility can be afforded in on-demand crowdwork by providing workers more control of their work time within individual tasks. through two randomized behavioral experiments, we find that granting more flexibility in tasks significantly influences the ways workers work and leads to higher work quantity and similar work quality, and workers also attach substantial value to the flexibility provided to them. together, these results highlight the importance and benefits of allowing workers to control their own time in individual tasks in on-demand crowdwork.",427
Tensions of Data-Driven Reflection: A Case Study of Real-Time Emotional Biosensing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657132,"biosensing displays, increasingly enrolled in emotional reflection, promise authoritative insight by presenting users' emotions as discrete categories. rather than machines interpreting emotions, we sought to explore an alternative with emotional biosensing displays in which users formed their own interpretations and felt comfortable critiquing the display. so, we designed, implemented, and deployed, as a technology probe, an emotional biosensory display: ripple is a shirt whose pattern changes color responding to the wearer's skin conductance, which is associated with excitement. 17 participants wore ripple over 2 days of daily life. while some participants appreciated the 'physical connection' ripple provided between body and emotion, for others ripple fostered insecurities about 'how much' feeling they had. despite our design intentions, we found participants rarely questioned the display's relation to their feelings. using biopolitics to speculate on ripple's surprising authority, we highlight ethical stakes of biosensory representations for sense of self and ways of feeling. we contribute the design and study of ripple, a technology probe that explores an alternative engagement with emotional biosensory data displays. instead of presenting user emotions as discrete categorical states, ripple’s display is a highly ambiguous color-changing fabric pattern. instead of seeking to present authoritative insights with our data display, we intended the design to invite open-ended emotional interpretation and critical questioning. yet, our analysis of vignettes of participants’ lived experiences with ripple point to broader tensions of affective biosensing technologies. despite our designerly efforts to invite questioning or critique, the data display still held authority even as it fostered insecurities that may not have been warranted. despite the display’s multifaceted ambiguity, it still reconstituted feeling in its own terms of measurement. going forward, we suggest designers of emotional biosensing technologies continue to explore these tensions and related issues of measurement, representation, and interpretation. we have presented three theoretical lenses that helped us think about these tensions. boehner et al.’s affect-as-interaction emphasizes the socioculturally constructed and performative nature of emotion and influenced our design approach [5]. verbeek’s theory of technological mediation helps analyze interactions between people and technologies to consider how biosensing designs shape what counts as real or valuable [70]. biopolitics helps consider how biosensing designs are situated within broader societal discourses of health and authority [51,52]. our findings and analysis made us more attuned to how emotional biosensing designs can suggest new ways of feeling, for better or worse. far from being a neutral observer, biosensing actively shapes our conception of affect, feeling, and emotion, and becomes embroiled in questions of how or what we should feel or be.",428
Communicating Algorithmic Process in Online Behavioral Advertising,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657133,"advertisers develop algorithms to select the most relevant advertisements for users. however, the opacity of these algorithms, along with their potential for violating user privacy, has decreased user trust and preference in behavioral advertising. to mitigate this, advertisers have started to communicate algorithmic processes in behavioral advertising. however, how revealing parts of the algorithmic process affects users' perceptions towards ads and platforms is still an open question. to investigate this, we exposed 32 users to why an ad is shown to them, what advertising algorithms infer about them, and how advertisers use this information. users preferred interpretable, non-creepy explanations about why an ad is presented, along with a recognizable link to their identity. we further found that exposing users to their algorithmically-derived attributes led to algorithm disillusionment---users found that advertising algorithms they thought were perfect were far from it. we propose design implications to effectively communicate information about advertising algorithms. in this study, we contribute to understanding how communicating aspects of the algorithmic ad curation process affects users’ perception of their ad experience. our analysis highlighted misperceptions about algorithmic omniscience which subsided when users were exposed to the inner workings of the system. this illustrates that as more ads are tailored to users via algorithmic processes, advertisers should provide users with interpretable explanations about these processes. advertisers also need to increase the visibility of such disclosure mechanisms as the current practices fail to do so. communicating algorithmic processes not only benefits users by providing them with a more realistic understanding of how their information is processed, but could also help advertisers to regain or increase user trust in and satisfaction with their ad experience.",429
Quadcopter-Projected In-Situ Navigation Cues for Improved Location Awareness,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657134,"every day people rely on navigation systems when exploring unknown urban areas. many navigation systems use multimodal feedback like visual, auditory or tactile cues. although other systems exist, users mostly rely on a visual navigation using their smartphone. however, a problem with visual navigation systems is that the users have to shift their attention to the navigation system and then map the instructions to the real world. we suggest using in-situ navigation instructions that are presented directly in the environment by augmenting the reality using a projector-quadcopter. through a user study with 16 participants, we show that using in-situ instructions for navigation leads to a significantly higher ability to observe real-world points of interest. further, the participants enjoyed following the projected navigation cues. in this paper, we investigated using a quadcopter-mounted projector for presenting in-situ navigation instructions as an alternative to smartphone navigation instructions. in a user study, we compared the in-situ navigation instructions to a state-ofthe-art smartphone navigation. the results show that although participants required considerably more time to complete a route using in-situ navigation instructions using a levitating projector, the participants could memorize points of interest significantly more accurately using in-situ instructions. we conclude that using in-situ navigation instructions while walking leads to a higher memorability of the surroundings. in future work, we want to investigate the social implications of using a personal quadcopter for receiving in-situ navigation instructions. further, we want to explore more use-cases, e.g. augmenting sports or outdoor sightseeing and introducing a quadcopter-mounted projector as a smart companion for everyday scenarios.",430
P2PSTORY: Dataset of Children as Storytellers and Listeners in Peer-to-Peer Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657145,"understanding social-emotional behaviors in storytelling interactions plays a critical role in the development of interactive educational technologies for children. a challenge when designing for such interactions using technology like social robots, virtual agents, and tablets is understanding the social-emotional behaviors pertinent to storytelling-especially when emulating a natural peer-to-peer relation between the child and the technology. we present p2pstory, a dataset of young children (5-6 years old) engaging in natural peer-to-peer storytelling interactions with fellow classmates. the dataset consists of rich social behaviors of children without adult supervision, with each participant demonstrating being a storyteller and a listener. the dataset contains 58 video recorded sessions along with a diverse set of behavioral annotations as well as developmental and demographic profiles of each child participant. we describe the main characteristics of the dataset in addition to findings that reveal perceptual differences between adults and children when evaluating the attentiveness of listeners. p2pstory is a dataset of peer-to-peer storytelling interactions between children of 5-6 years old demonstrating rich social-emotional behaviors as both storytellers and listeners. the objective of this work was to capture children engaged in natural social interactions, not hindered from adult supervision or structured from constrained tasks. children participated in multiple interactions as either a storyteller or listener, allowing for the exploration of individual variations in behaviors across interactions of either roles. additionally, these interactions took place with familiar peers as opposed to novel adults. in these three ways, the dataset is a unique contribution to the study of human-human interactions for the design and evaluation of interactive story-listening and story-telling technologies. furthermore, we provide initial evidence highlighting the importance of accounting for the relevance of social-emotional communicative behaviors as a function of the observer, which significantly differs in perception between an adult and a child. one of the fundamental basis of human-computer interaction research stems from reeves’ and nass’ work demonstrating how the human mind will respond to technology as social actors—capable of evoking the same social responses as they would with a human partner [32]. through data-driven methods to better understand human social-emotional interactions, we can more appropriately design the human-like behaviors of interactive technologies for targeted social interactions such as storytelling.",431
Personalizing Persuasive Strategies in Gameful Systems to Gamification User Types,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657146,"persuasive gameful systems are effective tools for motivating behaviour change. research has shown that tailoring these systems to individuals can increase their efficacy; however, there is little knowledge on how to personalize them. we conducted a large-scale study of 543 participants to investigate how different gamification user types responded to ten persuasive strategies depicted in storyboards representing persuasive gameful health systems. our results reveal that people's gamification user types play significant roles in the perceived persuasiveness of different strategies. people scoring high in the 'player' user type tend to be motivated by competition, comparison, cooperation, and reward while 'disruptors' are likely to be demotivated by punishment, goal-setting, simulation, and self-monitoring. 'socialisers' could be motivated using any of the strategies; they are the most responsive to persuasion overall. finally, we contribute to chi research and practice by offering design guidelines for tailoring persuasive gameful systems to each gamification user type. the current study investigated the relations between gamification user types and persuasive strategies for the first time in the literature. this paper makes an initial contribution to understanding how to tailor persuasive gameful systems to increase their efficacy based on how the user’s responsiveness to persuasive strategies is determined by their user type. as a secondary objective, we provide qualitative insights based on users’ comments to explain why distinct strategies may motivate behaviours for people belonging to a particular user type and demotivate others. through our study, we uncovered the shortcomings of the untailored approach and presented design opportunities for designing persuasive gameful systems that appeal both to a broad audience and for tailoring to a particular user type. our findings indicate that socialiser, disruptor, and player are the three gamification user types that predict most of the variability in the effectiveness of persuasive strategies and thus, must be taken into account to achieve user-type-driven tailoring. our findings could guide designers in making informed choices on the strategies to employ and those to avoid when designing persuasive tailored gameful systems. in the future, we plan to apply the guidelines in designing and evaluating the effectiveness of actual tailored persuasive gameful systems and to validate our findings across other health behaviour domains (e.g., discouraging drug use, risky sexual behaviour, and smoking) to investigate possible variability in the persuasiveness of the strategies. we hope to explore the role of culture and personal attitude towards drinking on the persuasiveness of the strategies.",432
Your Eyes Tell: Leveraging Smooth Pursuit for Assessing Cognitive Workload,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657147,"a common objective for context-aware computing systems is to predict how user interfaces impact user performance regarding their cognitive capabilities. existing approaches such as questionnaires or pupil dilation measurements either only allow for subjective assessments or are susceptible to environmental influences and user physiology. we address these challenges by exploiting the fact that cognitive workload influences smooth pursuit eye movements. we compared three trajectories and two speeds under different levels of cognitive workload within a user study (n=20). we found higher deviations of gaze points during smooth pursuit eye movements for specific trajectory types at higher cognitive workload levels. using an svm classifier, we predict cognitive workload through smooth pursuit with an accuracy of 99.5% for distinguishing between low and high workload as well as an accuracy of 88.1% for estimating workload between three levels of difficulty. we discuss implications and present use cases of how cognition-aware systems benefit from inferring cognitive workload in real-time by smooth pursuit eye movements. this work investigated the influence of cognitive workload on smooth pursuit eye movements using three different trajectories with two different velocities. using an auditory delayed digit recall n-back task to induce cognitive workload, a higher deviation of gaze points from shown trajectories is measured compared to measurements when not inducing cognitive workload. based on our results, we create a personindependent classifier for estimating binary workload and a person-dependent classifier for distinguishing different levels of cognitive workload. while binary cognitive workload classification can be elicited in the public using smooth pursuit interfaces, private spaces benefit from person-dependent classifier calibration to determine different levels of cognitive workload. having such a measurement modality without the need of body-worn devices goes a step towards real-time mental state estimation in ubiquitous computing environments. user interfaces can then provide intervention mechanisms to relax or help users based on their current context. our classifier depends on eye gaze only and fits into a number of application scenarios. it can be deployed in real-world scenarios to estimate the presence of cognitive workload in real-time. thereby, the assessment can be done contactless without the need for additional bodyworn sensors. in future work, we plan to focus on specific use cases which leverage smooth pursuit as interaction modality to provide an assessment of cognitive workload in real-time. this input will be used to adapt user interfaces of applications accordingly. this includes implementations on public and head-mounted displays using smooth pursuit as input. furthermore, we want to evaluate the efficiency of assessing cognitive workload unconsciously in user interfaces which naturally display moving elements. this comprises monitoring tasks, which can be found in air traffic and train control system. consequently, such systems can be benchmarked and optimized regarding their usage complexity. to complement this, further research aiming to correlate objective and subjective workload measures, such as eye movement deviations and nasa-tlx questionnaires, will be conducted. finally, we will investigate how multiple displayed moving stimuli will affect the classification performance and subjective perception of cognitive workload. to encourage research in this area, we published the data set for further analysis by the research community on our institute’s homepage.",433
FingerPing: Recognizing Fine-grained Hand Poses using Active Acoustic On-body Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657148,"fingerping is a novel sensing technique that can recognize various fine-grained hand poses by analyzing acoustic resonance features. a surface-transducer mounted on a thumb ring injects acoustic chirps (20hz to 6,000hz) to the body. four receivers distributed on the wrist and thumb collect the chirps. different hand poses of the hand create distinct paths for the acoustic chirps to travel, creating unique frequency responses at the four receivers. we demonstrate how fingerping can differentiate up to 22 hand poses, including the thumb touching each of the 12 phalanges on the hand as well as 10 american sign language poses. a user study with 16 participants showed that our system can recognize these two sets of poses with an accuracy of 93.77% and 95.64%, respectively. we discuss the opportunities and remaining challenges for the widespread use of this input technique. in this paper, we presents fingerping, a active acoustic sensing technology that can recognize fine-grained hand poses by analyzing how the frequency response changes after traveling through different paths in hands. a user study with 16 participants shows that fingerping can recognize the tap locations at 12 phalanges and 10 poses from asl with an accuracy of 93.77% and 95.64% respectively.",434
Frames and Slants in Titles of Visualizations on Controversial Topics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657149,"slanted framing in news article titles induce bias and influence recall. while recent studies found that viewers focus extensively on titles when reading visualizations, the impact of titles in visualization remains underexplored. we study frames in visualization titles, and how the slanted framing of titles and the viewer's pre-existing attitude impact recall, perception of bias, and change of attitude. when asked to compose visualization titles, people used five existing news frames, an open-ended frame, and a statistics frame. we found that the slant of the title influenced the perceived main message of a visualization, with viewers deriving opposing messages from the same visualization. the results did not show any significant effect on attitude change. we highlight the danger of subtle statistics frames and viewers' unwarranted conviction of the neutrality of visualizations. finally, we present a design implication for the generation of visualization titles and one for the viewing of titles. in this study, we identified general frames for visualization title and studied the influence of titles on the recall, perception of bias, and attitude change. visualization title frames matched pre-established news frames with an addition of openended frames and statistic frames. statistic frames referred to variables, trends, and values, and occurred most frequently in slanted titles. the results showed that the slanted frames in titles influenced the perceived main message of a visualization without impacting the perceived bias. informed by bias assimilation, we further examined how people’s pre-existing attitudes effect the composition and interpretation of visualization titles. we observed that many participants wrote slanted titles that matched their attitude even when explicitly instructed to write neutral titles. the results did not show a significant effect of attitude-consistency or the slant of the title on the perception of bias nor on attitude change, mainly because people viewed the information as impartial and indicated little attitude change. our findings suggest the influence of titles on visualization interpretation and reveal the lack of awareness on the potential bias introduced by the title. we conclude by suggesting how the frames can be used in automated generation of visualizations and how people could interact with visualization titles for improved comprehension of the data. our results are directly applicable to social media sites such as twitter, imgur, and reddit where visualizations are currently being shared as a standalone material. it is uncertain whether our results can be transferred to platforms where visualizations are presented along with longer accompanying text, such as online news sites. we propose continuing the study in the context of news articles for future work.",435
Typing on an Invisible Keyboard,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657140,"a virtual keyboard takes a large portion of precious screen real estate. we have investigated whether an invisible keyboard is a feasible design option, how to support it, and how well it performs. our study showed users could correctly recall relative key positions even when keys were invisible, although with greater absolute errors and overlaps between neighboring keys. our research also showed adapting the spatial model in decoding improved the invisible keyboard performance. this method increased the input speed by 11.5% over simply hiding the keyboard and using the default spatial model. our 3-day multi-session user study showed typing on an invisible keyboard could reach a practical level of performance after only a few sessions of practice: the input speed increased from 31.3 wpm to 37.9 wpm after 20 - 25 minutes practice on each day in 3 days, approaching that of a regular visible keyboard (41.6 wpm). overall, our investigation shows an invisible keyboard with adapted spatial model is a practical and promising interface option for the mobile text entry systems. invisible keyboard is a desirable design option. our research on invisible keyboard answered a set of questions through 3 experiments: are users able type on an invisible keyboard? if so, how will users type differently? what technology can be applied to support it? what is its performance? first, experiment 1 showed it was possible to type on an invisible keyboard. users had strong memory recall on key positions: they could correctly recall key positions relative to the qwerty layout even when keys were completely invisible and with 1 or 2 finger typing. on the other hand, their touch point distributions exhibited different patterns compared with those on a visible keyboard. second, we examined whether adapting the spatial model of the decoder would improve the performance of the invisible keyboard. we derived the adapted spatial model for the invisible keyboard from our study data, integrated it into a stateof-the-art decoder with a language model, and systematically evaluated it. experiment 2 showed this method was very effective. it increased the typing speed of the invisible keyboard by 11.5% over the baseline invisible keyboard which used the default spatial model (i.e., unadapted) and simply hid the keys. we disclose the parameters of the derived spatial model (in appendix), which are available for use by other researchers. third, experiment 3 showed typing on the invisible keyboard was easy-to-learn, practical and promising. it was remarkable that the input speed of the invisible keyboard was approaching the visible keyboard after 60 - 75 minutes practice in 3 days (20 - 25 minutes on each day). no significant difference was observed between the speed of the invisible keyboard on the last day (37.9 wpm) and the speed of a regular visible keyboard (41.6 wpm). typing on an invisible keyboard was also easy to learn. the input speed of the invisible keyboard increased from 31.3 wpm on day 1 to 37.9 wpm on day 3, showing a rapid learning process. overall, our investigation shows that an invisible keyboard with adapted spatial model is a practical and promising interface option for the mobile text entry systems.",436
Fairness and Accountability Design Needs for Algorithmic Support in High-Stakes Public Sector Decision-Making,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657141,"calls for heightened consideration of fairness and accountability in algorithmically-informed public decisions-like taxation, justice, and child protection-are now commonplace. how might designers support such human values? we interviewed 27 public sector machine learning practitioners across 5 oecd countries regarding challenges understanding and imbuing public values into their work. the results suggest a disconnect between organisational and institutional realities, constraints and needs, and those addressed by current research into usable, transparent and 'discrimination-aware' machine learning-absences likely to undermine practical initiatives unless addressed. we see design opportunities in this disconnect, such as in supporting the tracking of concept drift in secondary data sources, and in building usable transparency tools to identify risks and incorporate domain knowledge, aimed both at managers and at the 'street-level bureaucrats' on the frontlines of public service. we conclude by outlining ethical challenges and future directions for collaboration in these high-stakes applications. researchers should be wary of assuming, as seems often the case in current discourse, that those involved in the procurement and deployment of these systems are necessarily naïve about challenges such as fairness and accountability in the public sector’s use of algorithmic decision support. this assumption sits particularly uncomfortably with the value attributed to participatory design and action research in hci and information systems [33, 6]. while those involved in acquiring these technologies for the public sector might not be prime candidates for developing new statistical technologies for understanding bias and outputs in complex models, this does not mean that they do not care or do not try to tackle ethical issues that they perceive. indeed, as well as the individual perspectives in this paper, some public agencies are already developing their own in-house ethical codes for data science activities [30]. yet issues like fairness have been shown to come with technically difficult to reconcile, or even irreconcilable trade-offs—something well-demonstrated by alexandra chouldechova’s impossibility theorem illustrating that independently plausible formal definitions of fairness can be statistically incompatible with one another [13], or concerns raised that explanation facilities might work better for some outputs than for others [20]. reconciling these harder boundaries and issues within messy organisational contexts will present a major challenge to research uptake in this field in the coming years. where to go from here? we believe that the challenges we outlined above—dealing with changing data, better understanding discretion and the augmentation of model outputs, better transmission of social practices and improved communication of nuanced aspects of performance—sit amongst a range of promising areas for future interdisciplinary collaboration. the implicit and explicit assumptions of proposed solutions to both these challenges and to the broader issues must be stresstested in real situations. this presents important questions of methodology. domain-specific, organisational and contextual factors are crucial to closely consider in the context of interventions intended to improve the fairness and accountability of algorithmic decision-support. the institutional constraints, high stakes and crossed lines of accountability in the public sector arguably presents even more reason to do so. only so much can be learned from studying systems in vitro, even with access to impressive quantities of relevant, quality data with which to experiment. those interested in transformative impact in the area of fair and accountable machine learning must move towards studying these processes in vivo, in the messy, socio-technical contexts in which they inevitably exist. interventions will have to cope with institutional factors, political winds, technical lock-in and ancient, withering infrastructure head on, as they would have to in the real world. researchers will have to facilitate the navigation of contested values, and will not always have the freedom of seeking the types of accountability or fairness that they feel most comfortable with. such challenges should be embraced. to enable this, trust will need to be built between public bodies and researchers; trust that is currently being endangered by ‘gotcha!’–style research that seeks to identify problematic aspects of algorithmic systems from afar without working collaboratively to understand the processes by which they came about and might be practically remedied. action research is a core methodology that would support these aims [6], but the combination of high stakes and a wariness that researchers might be spending more effort looking for algorithmic harms than offering help to fix it might make public agencies reluctant to open up to research interventions. rarely have the issues hci concerns itself with been as directly involved in steering choices related to the use of governmental power as much as they are today. as we involve more advanced decision-support, and even decision-making, systems in the workings of the state, this field might even be the ‘difference that makes a difference’ to the rights and freedoms of vulnerable societal groups. we believe that making this difference is possible, but only in close collaboration with different disciplines, practitioners and affected stakeholders. future research must engage with not only with the new questions and avenues of exploration such research brings, but also the practical constraints that come with studying politically charged settings and developing workable social and technical improvements within them.",437
PEP (3D Printed Electronic Papercrafts): An Integrated Approach for 3D Sculpting Paper-Based Electronic Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657142,"we present pep (printed electronic papercrafts), a set of design and fabrication techniques to integrate electronic based interactivities into printed papercrafts via 3d sculpting. we explore the design space of pep, integrating four functions into 3d paper products: actuation, sensing, display, and communication, leveraging the expressive and technical opportunities enabled by paper-like functional layers with a stack of paper. we outline a seven-step workflow, introduce a design tool we developed as an add-on to an existing cad environment, and demonstrate example applications that combine the electronic enabled functionality, the capability of 3d sculpting, and the unique creative affordances by the materiality of paper. we introduced printed electronic papercrafts by 3d sculpting. leveraging electronically enhanced papercrafts with 3d sculpting can enable new creative possibilities and we presented a set of fabrication techniques with a design editor to afford such prototyping using today’s technology. by inserting functional layers into a stack of plain paper, we can develop interactive 3d paper prototypes by cutting and gluing sheets of paper. our software supports designing the integration process with a set of functionality (actuation, sensing, display, and communication). we believe the unique affordances of paper prototypes can be further extended, and in this paper we explored and demonstrated what’s possible today by combining paper with electronic components and leveraging such combination with 3d sculpting.",438
Between Grassroots and the Hierarchy: Lessons Learned from the Design of a Public Services Directory,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657143,"there is a growing interest in hci research studying technology for citizen engagement in civic issues. we are now seeing issues around technologies for empowerment and participation, long discussed in hci literature, appropriated and formalised in government legislation. in the uk, recent reforms stipulate that community-based service information should be published in continuously updated, collaboratively designed and maintained, online platforms. we report on a qualitative study where we worked with stakeholders involved in the collaborative design, development and implementation of such a platform. our findings highlight tensions between the grassroots desire to innovate and local governments' rigid compliance with statutory obligation. we pose a series of challenges and opportunities for hci researchers engaged in the design of civic technologies to consider going forward, addressing issues of engagement in policy, measures of participation and tools for enabling participatory processes in public institutions. in this paper, we have reported on a 12-month study where we participated in the design, development and implementation of a local offer digital platform. we saw how new government legislation became a locus for conflict around individual interpretations and aspirations, concerns and suspicions. we have highlighted tensions that arise when new legislation is enacted and translated through the values of grassroots organisations and citizen groups working with inflexible bureaucratic hierarchies and discussed opportunities for the role of hci in this context. in doing so, we assert that such opportunities cannot be pursued purely as a means for governments to save money by providing tools for ‘streamlining’ service provision. rather efforts should support citizens and governments alike to share and make sense of their diverse perspectives. taking a more critical stance, however, where local government cannot fulfil its fundamental responsibility to citizens, we should use our position as ‘middle-out’ mediators and observers to narrate the struggles of potentially marginalised or disenfranchised groups in the production of government services. in doing so, we might call into question the logic and failures of neo-liberal government, and demonstrate and evidence successful workarounds. this is our responsibility as civic actors—to both create and record the ways in which digital technologies are shaping local government with and for their citizens. the work presented here is just one example of that record. finally, we present a short summary of the main implications that we derive from our work, that hci researchers should: (i) support citizen evaluation of local government consultation and evidence their role in dialogue; (ii) identify opportunities to influence legislation and policy before it is handed down; (iii) design tools to document and support the perseverance of grassroots workers and activists and (iv) reflect upon and embrace their own middle-out position.",439
Social Influences on Executive Functioning in Autism: Design of a Mobile Gaming Platform,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657144,"most studies of executive function (ef) in autism spectrum disorder (asd) focus on cognitive information processing, emphasizing less the social interaction deficits core to asd. we designed a mobile game that uses social and nonsocial stimuli to assess children's ef skills. the game comprised three components involving different ef skills: cognitive flexibility (shifting/inference), inhibitory control, and short-term memory. by recruiting 65 children with and without asd to play the mobile game, we investigated the potential of such platforms for capturing important phenotypic characteristics of individuals with autism. results highlighted between-diagnostic-group differences in playing patterns with children with asd showing broad patterns of ef deficits, but with relative strengths in nonsocial short-term memory, and preserved response to emotional inhibition cues. we showed the system could predict iq, an important target for clinical treatment, towards the goal of developing platforms to act as long-term, efficient, and effective behavioral biomarkers for asd. we developed a mobile video game designed to explore and quantify executive functioning skills in children with asd, separately considering social and nonsocial performance so as to disentangle broader patterns of cognitive deficit from the social deficits specific to the disorder. we found that there were specific diagnosis by performance class interactions, such as stronger non-social short-term memory in asd as compared to their social short-term memory, but also preserved areas of ability in children with asd, such as inhibitory response to angry faces. these results may be informative at a theoretical level regarding areas of strengths and weakness at a group level for children with asd. at the same time, with an interest in creating a prototype for longer-term monitoring of clinically-relevant change, we designed the system to be engaging for participants in a narrow time window (e.g. one time a day), so as to balance the increased enthusiasm children with asd may have for digital platforms against the potential for problematic game play. we showed, using both standard psychological approaches as well as machine learning methods, that patterns of performance on our delivered tasks were associated with both developmental level and iq, moving us towards the goal of developing video game behavioral biomarkers for clinically relevant targets for asd. physical patterns of play, derived via accelerometer and gyroscope readings provided an extra layer of interpretation which may be exploited in the future to further improve phenotypic prediction accuracy. as a proof-of-concept, this work highlights social and nonsocial ef performance asymmetries in asd, suggesting that digital systems modeling clinicallyrelevant features may need to consider pathology interactions. while a great deal of future work needs to be done to better assess the social and nonsocial asymmetry, this study represents a step towards targeting mobile video game development to specific characteristics of mental health conditions, with the end goal of developing more usable daily monitoring systems for children with asd.",440
A Large Inclusive Study of Human Listening Rates,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657255,"as conversational agents and digital assistants become increasingly pervasive, understanding their synthetic speech becomes increasingly important. simultaneously, speech synthesis is becoming more sophisticated and manipulable, providing the opportunity to optimize speech rate to save users time. however, little is known about people's abilities to understand fast speech. in this work, we provide the first large-scale study on human listening rates. run on labinthewild, it used volunteer participants, was screen reader accessible, and measured listening rate by accuracy at answering questions spoken by a screen reader at various rates. our results show that blind and low-vision people, who often rely on audio cues and access text aurally, generally have higher listening rates than sighted people. the findings also suggest a need to expand the range of rates available on personal devices. these results demonstrate the potential for users to learn to listen to faster rates, expanding the possibilities for human-conversational agent interaction. in this work, we presented the frst large-scale study of human listening rates, with the aim of informing the optimization of speech rate for conversational agents. by conducting a volunteer-based online study, we were able to reach a larger participant pool than previous studies. by making it accessible, we also reached a larger number of people with visual impairments, many of whom had experience with fast, synthetic speech. the study results show that people with visual impairments are typically the fastest listeners, in particular those exposed to screen readers at a young age. these results suggest that in optimizing conversational agent speech rate, an expanded set of speech rates should be considered, as well as tailoring to the individual user and content. more importantly, this work demonstrates that people with disabilities have incredible abilities and personal experiences which can inspire design, as previous research shows. a main takeaway of this project is to not view people with visual impairments primarily as consumers of assistive technologies; rather, recognize that they can inspire new avenues for humanconversational agent interactions. recognizing important contributions of blind people beyond their necessary perspective for accessibility improvements is an important step toward further integrating blind people into research and design.",441
Storyboard-Based Empirical Modeling of Touch Interface Performance,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657256,"touch interactions are now ubiquitous, but few tools are available to help designers quickly prototype touch interfaces and predict their performance. for rapid prototyping, most applications only support visual design. for predictive modelling, tools such as cogtool generate performance predictions but do not represent touch actions natively and do not allow exploration of different usage contexts. to combine the benefits of rapid visual design tools with underlying predictive models, we developed the storyboard empirical modelling tool (stem) for exploring and predicting user performance with touch interfaces. stem provides performance models for mainstream touch actions, based on a large corpus of realistic data. we evaluated stem in an experiment and compared its predictions to empirical times for several scenarios. the study showed that our predictions are accurate (within 7% of empirical values on average), and that stem correctly predicted differences between alternative designs. our tool provides new capabilities for exploring and predicting touch performance, even in the early stages of design. storyboard empirical modelling (stem) is a drag-and-drop tool that allows designers to quickly prototype touch interactions and explore their performance implications. stem relies on the touch-action database, a crowd-sourced data corpus that provides empirical characterisations of tap, point, drag, swipe, scale and rotate touch interactions across a wide range of device types, hand grips, and screen orientations. although we developed the tadb corpus primarily as the foundation for predictions with stem, the corpus is available on the web for other researchers and practitioners. we carried out several evaluations of stem, and showed that its predictions are accurate within an average of 7% difference from empirical values, and never worse than 13%, across a variety of scenarios – and substantially better than existing tools. stem provides new capabilities for designers and researchers who need to understand user performance with touch interfaces at any stage in the design process.",442
Adding Force Feedback to Mixed Reality Experiences and Games using Electrical Muscle Stimulation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657257,"we present a mobile system that enhances mixed reality experiences and games with force feedback by means of electrical muscle stimulation (ems). the benefit of our approach is that it adds physical forces while keeping the users' hands free to interact unencumbered-not only with virtual objects, but also with physical objects, such as props and appliances. we demonstrate how this supports three classes of applications along the mixed-reality continuum: (1) entirely virtual objects, such as furniture with ems friction when pushed or an ems-based catapult game. (2) virtual objects augmented via passive props with ems-constraints, such as a light control panel made tangible by means of a physical cup or a balance-the-marble game with an actuated tray. (3) augmented appliances with virtual behaviors, such as a physical thermostat dial with ems-detents or an escape-room that repurposes lamps as levers with detents. we present a user-study in which participants rated the ems-feedback as significantly more realistic than a no-ems baseline. we demonstrated a fully mobile system that empowers mixed reality games and experiences with mid-air force feedback by means of electrical muscle stimulation. our system, built around the hololens headset, and actuates the users’ wrists, biceps, triceps and shoulder muscles. the main benefit of our approach is that it leaves users’ hands free, thus allowing users to interact unencumbered—not only with virtual objects, but also with physical objects in their surroundings, such as props and appliances. ems opens novel interaction opportunities in mr besides the direct implications for increased realism in mr gaming, ems might uncover new terrains for augmented passive objects and appliances. for instance, an appliance that is augmented with ems might have more potential if we think of using it daily. unlike retrofab [52] that complements the appliance with updated hardware ui, an emsaugmented appliance allows updating the ui of a device by merely updating the software (i.e., the ems side). also, our tangible dial that automatically recalled the last position, i.e., the cup in the “walkthrough”, points to another strength of exploring ems in mr. ems might assist in aligning virtual and physical realities to prevent inconsistent states often introduced by physical props (as debated in [33,28]). while previous methods solved this by mechanically coupling or actuating the props (e.g., mechanically constrained tangible dials [28]), ems allows for everyday handheld objects to move without instrumentation.",443
Learning from the Veg Box: Designing Unpredictability in Agency Delegation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657258,"the internet of things (iot) promises to enable applications that foster a more efficient, sustainable, and healthy way of life. if end-users are to take full advantage of these developments we foresee the need for future iot systems and services to include an element of autonomy and support the delegation of agency to software processes and connected devices. to inform the design of such future technology, we report on a breaching experiment designed to investigate how people integrate an unpredictable service, through the veg box scheme, in everyday life. findings from our semi-structured interviews and a two-week diary study with 11 households reveal that agency delegation must be warranted, that it must be possible to incorporate delegated decisions into everyday activities, and that delegation is subject to constraint. we further discuss design implications on the need to support people's diverse values, and their coordinative and creative practices. in this paper, we report the findings of a qualitative study, through semi-structured interviews and a two-week diary study with 11 households in the uk, which seeks to understand how people manage a veg box scheme as an instance of an inherently unpredictable service. in particular, we focus on how people manage agency delegation and integrate the veg box into their everyday life. our findings suggest that agency delegation must be warranted, that it must be possible to incorporate delegated decisions into everyday activities, and that delegation is subject to constraint. we consider the potential impact of these social organisational issues on the design of a future aiot supporting food-based practices in the home, and the challenges of making agency delegation accountable to meal planning, persons’ schedules, food-centred values, adaptation and innovation, and the social division of labour in which computational agency will ultimately be embedded.",444
Knotation: Exploring and Documenting Choreographic Processes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657259,"contemporary choreographers often interact directly with dancers when exploring their ideas, but lack adequate tools for capturing and documenting their work. although our first study of choreographers and dancers revealed diverse strategies for recording choreographic fragments, we found that they all worked in terms of constraints, which they represented via spatial diagrams, as movement qualities or with their own personal notation system. this led to the design of knotation, a mobile pen-based tool that lets choreographers sketch their own representations of choreographic ideas and render them interactive. in study two, knotation served as a technology probe to support the contrasting practices of three professional choreographers. we revised knotation based on their input, and ran a third structured observation study with six professional choreographers. knotation easily supported both dance-then-record and record-then-dance strategies. participants used and appropriated knotation's advanced features, including the combination of interactive timelines and floorplan diagrams, to represent and explore complex choreographic structures. our goal is to design interactive digital tools that support exploration and documentation of choreographic ideas, without enforcing a particular creative process. we began by observing a professional choreographer and several dancers, which highlighted both the diversity in how they represent choreographic fragments, as well as the need for capturing and annotating movement constraints. we designed knotation, a mobile pen-based tool that offers a lightweight method for sketching choreographic ideas with embedded images and video. users can sketch their own personal representations of the dance, and add various forms of interaction to further explore their ideas. using knotation v1 as a technology probe revealed contrasting strategies for capturing movement, constraints, or both. knotation v2 explicitly supports interactive timelines and floorplans, as well as incorporates participants’ suggestions. we then demonstrated how knotation v2 successfully supported opposite choreographic approaches (dance-then-record and record-then-dance), and allowed users a wide range of expression, at varying levels of formality. in future, we plan to explore the collaborative potential of knotation. other promising directions include extending support for personal sublanguages; letting users create their own instrument palettes [3]; and assessing results with the creativity support index [10].",445
A Data-Driven Analysis of Workers' Earnings on Amazon Mechanical Turk,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657250,"a growing number of people are working as part of on-line crowd work. crowd work is often thought to be low wage work. however, we know little about the wage distribution in practice and what causes low/high earnings in this setting. we recorded 2,676 workers performing 3.8 million tasks on amazon mechanical turk. our task-level analysis revealed that workers earned a median hourly wage of only ~$2/h, and only 4% earned more than $7.25/h. while the average requester pays more than $11/h, lower-paying requesters post much more work. our wage calculations are influenced by how unpaid work is accounted for, e.g., time spent searching for tasks, working on tasks that are rejected, and working on tasks that are ultimately not submitted. we further explore the characteristics of tasks and working patterns that yield higher hourly wages. our analysis informs platform design and worker tools to create a more positive future for crowd work. we used the log data of 2,676 workers performing 3.8 million tasks on amazon mechanical turk to understand worker hourly wages. our task-level analysis revealed a median hourly wage of ~$2/h, validating past self-report estimates. only 4% of workers earn more than $7.25/h, justifying concerns about non-payment of the minimum wage. we characterize three sources of unpaid work that impact the hourly wage (i.e., task search, task rejection, task return). we further explore the characteristics of tasks and working patterns that yield higher hourly wages.",446
Double-sided Printed Tactile Display with Electro Stimuli and Electrostatic Forces and its Assessment,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657251,"humans can perceive tactile sensation through multimodal stimuli. to demonstrate realistic pseudo tactile sensation for the users, a tactile display is needed that can provide multiple tactile stimuli. in this paper, we have explicated a novel printed tactile display that can provide both the electrical stimulus and the electrostatic force. the circuit patterns for each stimulus were fabricated by employing the technique of double-sided conductive ink printing. requirements for the fabrication process were analyzed and the durability of the tactile display was evaluated. users' perceptions of a single tactile stimulus and multiple tactile stimuli were also investigated. the obtained experimental results indicate that the proposed tactile display is capable of exhibiting realistic tactile sensation and can be incorporated by various applications such as tactile sensation printing of pictorial illustrations and paintings. furthermore, the proposed hybrid tactile display can contribute to accelerated prototyping and development of new tactile devices. in this paper, we proposed a hybrid tactile display which can provide “electrical stimulus” and “electrostatic force.” we also proposed prototyping technique that fabricating the hybrid tactile display using a double-sided inkjet printing. our prototyping technique enable easy and inexpensive fabrication of the experimental device and facilitates future work in the haptics field. we evaluated the user experience of the tactile sensations using combinations of electrical stimulus and electrostatic force. according to the results, tactile sensation is influenced by the interaction between electrical stimulus and electrostatic force with various frequency conditions. the proposed hybrid tactile display using an electrical stimulus and an electrostatic force presents a more realistic tactile presentation that has richer information than tactile feedback with a simple stimulus. finally, we showed a variety of novel applications for our conductive inkjet printing technique. a part of this study was presented in acm uist’17 demo [19].",447
RecipeScape: An Interactive Tool for Analyzing Cooking Instructions at Scale,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657252,"for cooking professionals and culinary students, understanding cooking instructions is an essential yet demanding task. common tasks include categorizing different approaches to cooking a dish and identifying usage patterns of particular ingredients or cooking methods, all of which require extensive browsing and comparison of multiple recipes. however, no existing system provides support for such in-depth and at-scale analysis. we present recipescape, an interactive system for browsing and analyzing the hundreds of recipes of a single dish available online. we also introduce a computational pipeline that extracts cooking processes from recipe text and calculates a procedural similarity between them. to evaluate how recipescape supports culinary analysis at scale, we conducted a user study with cooking professionals and culinary students with 500 recipes for two different dishes. results show that recipescape clusters recipes into distinct approaches, and captures notable usage patterns of ingredients and cooking actions. this paper presents recipescape, an interactive system for analyzing hundreds of recipes for a single dish by visualizing summaries of their structural patterns. our user study with cooking professionals and culinary students demonstrates that recipescape provides data-driven evidence to usual and unusual ingredients and cooking actions, common and exotic recipes, and different approaches to cooking a dish. there are a number of directions for possible future studies. as an immediate next step, we plan to extend this work to video-based recipes and how-to videos. examining rich context embedded in videos in aggregate could uncover trends and patterns, and analyzing them at scale will be able to provide answers to questions text recipes at scale cannot.",448
Fostering Commonfare. Infrastructuring Autonomous Social Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657253,"recently, hci scholars have started questioning the relationship between computing and political economy, with both general analyses of such relationships, and specific design cases describing design interventions. this paper contributes to this stream of reflections, and argues that it designers and hci scholars can critically engage with the contemporary phase of capitalism by infrastructuring the emergence of new institutional forms of autonomous social collaboration through it projects. more specifically, we discuss strategies and tactics that are available for it designers embracing an activist agenda while infrastructuring autonomous social collaborations. we draw on empirical data from an h2020 eu funded project -- commonfare -- that seeks to foster the emergence of alternative forms of welfare provision rooted in social collaboration. in this context, we discuss how the necessary multiple relations that unfold in a project with such ambitions shape both the language and the technologies of the project itself. the analysis of long-term evolution and short-term dynamics of the project can be developed in terms of strategic boundaries and tactical negotiations that are entailed by the practices of the actors involved in the project to manage relations with each other, coping with tensions and concerns, and contributing to the process of infrastructuring. when referring to our main research question – how can hci scholars and designers understand the configuration of participation in a large scale infrastructuring project rooted in political economy? – we can return to literature that stresses the relevance of the installed base [30, 32, 45] and the processes of configuration of participation [47]. indeed, much of the work in this first year of the commonfare project has served to continually iterate, through tactical negotiations, on our understanding of the installed base as a strategic boundary for action that follows. for any given effort toward a point of infrastructure, the way in which all parties participate in the process of participatory design has involved tailoring of their configuration through tactical negotiations. reflecting on our main research question, the first point to stress is that designers, in a case like commonfare, are continuously engaging in tactical actions of appropriation of the installed base, be they technological artefacts or legally binding documents, in order to make space for deviations based on the empirical work done. moreover, at any iteration, or point of infrastructure, what were previously tactical actions become more fixed, strategic elements, and the installed base on which further tactical actions are built. this points towards a need for designers wishing to engage in ambitious infrastructuring projects to understand that the relationships will evolve over time, and that while there are strategic actions that can be taken in terms of planning research activities, that the activities are then interpreted and enacted by partner organisations in different contexts (both in terms of the organisation’s expertise and background, as well as the particularities of any given country). as a result, the heterogeneous nature of the reports requires a higher level of communication and consideration, an overhead that is expected as the number of partners responsible for the project grows. therefore, the concepts of strategies and tactics allow for a renewed understanding of the relations between the installed base and the configuration of participation, in which the way participation is configured allow for tactical negotiations on the installed base, being it technological artefacts or the understanding of the social context, and the results of such negotiations rebuild the installed base as renewed strategic boundaries for further design. returning to the key differences of bødker et al. [4], the position of us as authors who also act within the consortium have given us a perspective on the relationships between the consortium and itself, the consortium and the ec, and the consortium and participants. this tension is one between the bottom-up ideals of commonfare as a participatory design project that seeks to tactically respond to the changing circumstances, and the strategic space of the project as defined by the funding rules and expectations of the ec. moreover, participatory design, in this case, is one of the ways through which the autonomy of social collaboration is fostered, as it entails possibilities for peoples’ experiences and perspectives to influence the technology they will engage with, instead of being heteronomated by technologies built by more powerful actors. the problem of the configuration of participation in specific cases remains, and in our case has been addressed by adjusting the project language, and not only including inputs for the design of the materiality of digital technologies. reflecting on political economy and hci, we have explicitly sought to address issues of political economy. in particular, the changes in the welfare state, where we have shown how the actions available to designers looking to support “real utopias” involve the intermixing relations among: institutional actors, the relevant social subjects, and a diverse set of organisations, including ngos. these different relations constitute the forms of social collaboration through which autonomy from the dictates of heteronomation could take shape [16]. this is visible not only in the consortium composition but also, and more importantly, in the kind of bottom-up, autonomous, welfare practices that we have collected and that we are supporting. finally, we have shown how it is possible for hci scholars and it designers to engage in large scale participatory infrastructuring processes embedding a progressive agenda, and that implies a combination of strategic and tactical actions by the different social aggregates with which researchers build relations. the concepts of strategies and tactics, therefore, provide a useful lens through which to understand the types of actions that establish the relationships among the different actors involved in and around commonfare, as well as to move the project towards its release goals. our use of the installed base as the strategic iterative result of these actions, together with an understanding of the tactical changes in the configuration of participation, is a promising direction through which design projects can be described and further developed, also involving the detail of socio-technical choices connected to the strategic and tactical movements of the actors involved.",449

"Am I a Bunny?: The Impact of High and Low Immersion Platforms and Viewers' Perceptions of Role on Presence, Narrative Engagement, and Empathy during an Animated 360° Video",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657268,"this study used both quantitative and qualitative data to assess whether a high immersion viewing platform (virtual reality headset) elicits stronger feelings of narrative engagement and empathy compared to a low immersion platform (smartphone) when viewing an animated 360° video. in line with prior research, participants (n = 65) reported greater feelings of presence in the high immersion condition compared to low immersion. however, immersive condition was not significantly related to narrative engagement or empathy. interview responses revealed that participants' perceptions of their role in the film experience (i.e., character, observer, or other/not sure) varied and were significantly related to narrative engagement. participants who saw themselves as a character (versus observer) reported higher narrative engagement and empathy. findings suggest that although a more immersive viewing platform can enhance presence during a 360° video experience, a clear understanding of viewer role is both difficult to achieve and critical to story comprehension and empathy. this study showed that, contrary to expectations, viewing a 360° video on a vr hmd with more immersive features did not necessarily encourage better comprehension of the story, involvement with the narrative, or empathy with the characters compared to a less immersive smartphone platform. as technologies become increasingly immersive, the need for research on ways to help viewers engage with the stories and characters also increases. this research suggests that at least one criteria for engagement and empathy is for participants to have a clear grasp of their role within the experience. immersive technology has vast potential for helping viewers experience new places and points of view. creators of content such as 360° video viewed through immersive platforms will need to develop a set of tools that can be used to help viewers understand their intended role.",454

Conveying the Perception of Kinesthetic Feedback in Virtual Reality using State-of-the-Art Hardware,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657261,"including haptic feedback in current consumer vr applications is frequently challenging, since technical possibilities to create haptic feedback in consumer-grade vr are limited. while most systems include and make use of the possibility to create tactile feedback through vibration, kinesthetic feedback systems almost exclusively rely on external mechanical hardware to induce actual sensations so far. in this paper, we describe an approach to create a feeling of such sensations by using unmodified off-the-shelf hardware and a software solution for a multi-modal pseudo-haptics approach. we first explore this design space by applying user-elicited methods, and afterwards evaluate our refined solution in a user study. the results show that it is indeed possible to communicate kinesthetic feedback by visual and tactile cues only and even induce its perception. while visual clipping was generally unappreciated, our approach led to significant increases of enjoyment and presence. vr got to a point, where most of all the visual consumer hardware has made huge steps. on the other hand, there is a tendency towards direct interaction using tracked controllers, where users stand or even walk in reality. this additional degree of freedom also leads to new challenges concerning the mismatch of real and virtual world. compared to the use of indirect interaction, like playing with a gamepad, users expect haptic or kinesthetic feedback when touching virtual objects. the current hardware is very limited displaying haptic features while the controller in the user’s hands as well as vibration is the only available haptic modality. we used the state-of-the-art-hardware, implemented different haptic representations using vibration and pseudo-haptics. our pseudo-haptic manipulation go much farther than prior reported ones, and can lead to obvious breaks with proprioception, but thereby increase their expressiveness. we measured the influence on immersion, enjoyment and perception related items, which were determined in a workshop with vr researchers. we also collected qualitative feedback on how the available channels should be designed and improved. improving the software implementation based on the suggestions, we found a strong influence of pseudo-haptic effects, while vibration was most of all seen as a supportive channel for visual effects. in addition, we found a very promising interaction between visual and vibration feedback for the communication of kinesthetic feedback. according to our participants, the combination of visual and vibration feedback is sufficient to communicate kinesthetic feedback. we therefore argue, that when being implemented well, kinesthetic feedback can not only be used to increase immersion, but also to increase enjoyment by becoming part of the game play.",457
A Bermuda Triangle?,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657262,"user experience (ux) evaluation is a growing field with diverse approaches. to understand the development since previous meta-review efforts, we conducted a state-of-the-art review of ux evaluation techniques with special attention to the triangulation between methods. we systematically selected and analyzed 100 papers from recent years and while we found an increase of relevant ux studies, we also saw a remaining overlap with pure usability evaluations. positive trends include an increasing percentage of field rather than lab studies and a tendency to combine several methods in ux studies. triangulation was applied in more than two thirds of the studies, and the most common method combination was questionnaires and interviews. based on our analysis, we derive common patterns for triangulation in ux evaluation efforts. a critical discussion about existing approaches should help to obtain stronger results, especially when evaluating new technologies. to analyze the current state of ux evaluation in academia, we systematically identified 280 relevant papers, out of which 100 papers were finally selected for full review. in the continuously growing number of papers over the years 2010-2016, an increasing diversity in this inherently multi-dimensional field can be found. this is, of course, an asset: a product may (at different stages of development) benefit from both “macro”- and “micro”-perspective evaluations [57]. however, we see that many of the challenges reported in earlier meta-reviews still remain, such as the weak links between theory and evaluation, little attention to expectations in ux, and a tendency towards self-defined questionnaires and post-use evaluation. progress could be identified in the use of triangulation, by inclusion of more methods as well as a larger number of studies performed in field contexts. thus, we can perhaps see land on the horizon, but conclude that ux evaluation currently still remains sort of a bermuda triangle, often depending on personal perceptions of ux rather than aggregated theory. we see that interest and efforts in the ux field still persist, and we look forward to further work. areas which need to be addressed are evaluation approaches to multi-device experiences, machine learning, upcoming technology for virtual experiences, and addressing expectations in ux. method triangulation needs to be used more coherently; for stronger results in ux studies, we recommend to integrate and structure data better. for example, a well-defined structuring of observational data, improved cross-analysis of qualitative and quantitative data, and a solid definition, which aspect of ux to evaluate, will bring results forward.",458
Designing Future Social Wearables with Live Action Role Play (Larp) Designers,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657263,"designing wearable technology that supports physical and social engagement in a collocated setting is challenging. in this research, we reached out to an expert community of crafters of social experiences: larpers (live action role players). larpers and larp designers have a longstanding tradition of designing and making use of a variety of elements, such as costumes, physical objects, environments, and recently also digital artifacts. these are crafted in support of co-experience values that we argue can inform the design of social wearables. we engaged in a co-design process with a game designer and co-founder of a larp production company, and embedded the resulting social wearables in a larp. here, we present the results of this design and implementation process, and articulate design affordances that resonate with our larp designer' values. this work may inspire and inform researchers and designers creating wearable technology that is aimed at supporting collocated engagement. we set out to explore the potential for wearables to augment collocated social interaction, by engaging in a research through design process to create wearables embedded in a larp, working closely with a larp designer. with the help of our larp design expert, we identified promising roles for the technology to support larp designers’ co-experience values of immersion and the experience of the many: tracking the characters’ scores and preferred physical interaction style, supporting in-person and in-character expression and communication, connection with one’s character, and mitigating the need for out of character communication. we took the concept of social affordances and articulated some to guide the design process towards these roles and co-experience values: social signaling, spectator sensitivity, social appropriateness, and emotional resonance. to translate these into design choices and features, we made use of concepts in hci for the design of technology in collocated social spaces, such as the spectator experience and concepts in proxemics. these choices were frequently discussed with our expert larp designer, to make sure that they would fit and support the larp’s magic circle of play. the completed designs, novel in the domain of larps [41] embodied well the values of immersion and the experience of the many, performing functions including keeping track of and displaying scores, indicating preferred physical interaction styles, supporting players’ expressivity and communication with others, and enhancing players’ connection with their own characters. reflecting about the positive reception of our designs, michael commented that “larpers want to use technology in their games as long as the technology supports the immersion of the game.” in fact players adapted the wearables to suit their own narrative purposes, using them in unanticipated ways. many of the affordance patterns and principles we developed and tested in this play situation have potential to apply to the design of wearables outside the context of play. we are currently drawing upon the lessons learned in this project, to create wearables that support interaction in everyday non-game contexts.",459
Antibiotic-Responsive Bioart: Exploring DIYbio as a Design Studio Practice,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657264,"our work links hybrid practices from biology, fine arts, and design in a studio setting to support materially-oriented engagement with biotechnology. using autoethnographic methods, we present our two-year process of converting an hci studio into a bsl-1 (biosafety level 1) facility, our iterative development of low-cost tools, and our own self-reflexive experimentation with (diy)bio protocols. insights from this work led us to design a weeklong bioart course, whereby junior highschool students creatively ""painted"" with bacteria and antibiotic substances, digitally designed stencils from the resulting petri dish images, and screenprinted them onto physical artifacts. our findings reveal the nuances of working with biological, analog, and digital materials in a design studio setting. we conclude by reflecting on diybio studio as a gathering of diverse actors who work with hybrid materials to give physical form to matters of concern. this paper framed diybio—hands-on work with biology outside of professional settings—as a design studio practice. we presented our autoethnographic process whereby our multidisciplinary team set up a bsl-1 design studio, practiced biology protocols, and iteratively designed low-cost tools to support this work. insights from our self-reflexive practice led us to develop a bioart course that combined techniques from microbiology, fine arts, and digital design to create antibiotic-responsive microbial art artifacts. our approach embraced design studio culture through open-ended activities, access to a variety of design media, frequent reflection and feedback from peers, and work on projects that materialized heterogeneous concerns. above all, we hope to have shown that linking hybrid practices in a studio setting is a powerful approach for hci because it offers new ways to engage with issues. this approach can be applied to support meaningful discourse around the intellectual and social challenges poses by emerging biotechnologies.",460

Bolt: Instantaneous Crowdsourcing via Just-in-Time Training,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657278,"real-time crowdsourcing has made it possible to solve problems that are beyond the scope of artificial intelligence (ai) within a matter of seconds, rather than hours or days with traditional crowdsourcing techniques. while this has led to an increase in the potential application domains of crowdsourcing and human computation, problems that require machine-level speeds---on the order of milliseconds, not seconds---have remained out of reach because of the fundamental bounds of human perception and response time. in this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to exceed these bounds by combining human and machine intelligence. we introduce the look-ahead approach, a hybrid intelligence workflow that enables instantaneous crowdsourcing systems (i.e., those that can return crowd responses within mere milliseconds). the look-ahead approach works by exploring possible future states that may be encountered within a short time horizon (e.g., a few seconds into the future) and prefetching crowd worker responses to these states. we validate the efficacy and explore the limitations of our approach on the bolt system, which consists of an arcade-style game (lightning dodger) that we formally model as a markov decision process (mdp). when the mdp reward function is unspecified---as in many real-world tasks---the look-ahead approach enables just-in-time (jit) training of the agent's policy function. through a series of crowd worker experiments, we demonstrate that the look-ahead approach can outperform the fastest individual worker by approximately two orders of magnitude. our work opens new avenues for hybrid intelligence systems that are as smart as people, but also far faster than humanly possible. we have introduced the look-ahead approach to facilitate the creation of bolt, the first instantaneous crowdsourcing system. these systems use real-time crowdsourcing in a hybrid intelligence workflow to provide just-in-time training of automated agents, achieving final response latencies on the order of milliseconds (median of 2ms), instead of seconds, hours, or days. our experiments with crowd workers demonstrate that a two order of magnitude speedup from the baseline response time is possible via our approach, and accuracy improvements are attainable via aggregation. while these results demonstrate the promise of the look-ahead approach and open avenues for instantaneous crowd-powered systems, scaling to larger state spaces using probabilistic sampling and queuing techniques remains an exciting and open problem for future work to explore.",464
Convey: Exploring the Use of a Context View for Chatbots,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657279,"text messaging-based conversational systems, popularly called chatbots, have seen massive growth lately. recent work on evaluating chatbots has found that there exists a mismatch between the chatbot's state of understanding (also called context) and the user's perception of the chatbot's understanding. users found it difficult to use chatbots for complex tasks as the users were uncertain of the chatbots' intelligence level and contextual state. in this work, we propose convey (context view), a window added to the chatbot interface, displaying the conversational context and providing interactions with the context values. we conducted a usability evaluation of convey with 16 participants. participants preferred using chatbot with convey and found it to be easier to use, less mentally demanding, faster, and more intuitive compared to a default chatbot without convey. the paper concludes with a discussion of the design implications offered by convey. in this work, we added a context view called convey to the top of the chatbot interface to help users have an understanding of the mental-state of the chatbot during the conversation (helping users and chatbot be on the same page) while sustaining the familiarity of the text-based messaging interface. moreover, convey adds the benefits of a form-based user interface by enabling entry of precise input through the interactive elements. the results from a 16-participant user study demonstrated that participants perceived chatbot with convey to be faster and easier to use. convey is generalizable to chatbots in any domain, and in future, we expect convey to be integrated and offered by many chatbot-hosting platforms.",465
Confronting Social Criticisms: Challenges when Adopting Data-Driven Policing Strategies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657270,"proponents of data-driven policing strategies claim that it makes policing organizations more effective, efficient, and accountable and has the potential to address some policing social criticisms (e.g. racial bias, lack of accountability and training). what remains less understood are the challenges when adopting data-driven policing as a response to these criticisms. we present results from a qualitative field study about the adoption of data-driven policing strategies in a midwestern police department in the united states. we identify three key challenges police face with data-driven adoption efforts: data-driven frictions, precarious and inactionable insights, and police metis concerns. we demonstrate the issues that data-driven initiatives create for policing and the open questions police agents face. these findings contribute an empirical account of how policing agents attend to the strengths and limits of big data's knowledge claims. lastly, we present data and design implications for policing. for the informants at mmpd, challenges of adopting datadriven strategies in policing are experienced as they negotiate the sociotechnical visions for their work, some of which were explicitly meant to confront social criticisms of policing. in this paper, we have made the following contributions: identified three key challenges in adopting of data-driven policing; identified how data can support and constrain police work and accountability; provided design implications for data use in police accountability.",466

This Changes Sustainable HCI,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657272,"more than a decade into sustainable hci (shci) research, the community is still struggling to converge on a shared understanding of sustainability and hci's role in addressing it. we think this is largely a positive sign, reflective of maturity; yet, lacking a clear set of aims and metrics for sustainability continues to be the community's impediment to progressing, hence we seek to articulate a vision around which the community can productively coalesce. drawing from recent shci publications, we identify commonalities that might form the basis of a shared understanding, and we show that this understanding closely aligns with the authoritative conception of a path to a sustainable future proffered by naomi klein in her book emphthis changes everything. we elaborate a set of contributions that shci is already making that can be unified under klein's narrative, and compare these categories of work to those found in past surveys of the field as evidence of substantive progress in shci. what we have presented in this paper is bound to cause controversy. we are under no illusions: a proportion of the community will disagree with the details of the vision set forth; and some will undoubtedly object to the project attempted herein of articulating a shared vision to begin with. we felt strongly, however, that it was important to illustrate the clarity that comes with pinning down a vision of shci going forward, and to invite the community to discuss this together. while we drew from many other voices in the field in formulating this vision, we also recognize that we have clearly argued in favor of one of the two dominant views represented by shci. we do not aim to be dictatorial; but equally we do not believe that all conceptions of sustainability have equal merit, and we fear that simultaneous pursuit of multiple ends may be counter-productive. further, we understand this to be a controversial position that may, in fact, go against the view presented by silberman et al. [94] which we (the authors) had contributed to only a few years ago. unfortunately, the ‘procrastination penalty’ applies to shci as it does to climate change. we have spent so long debating definitions of sustainability and shci, and being indecisive on a direction to pursue, that to have any reasonable chance of affecting change, we must make a bold and radical decision on a future course of action. our own experiences in participating in numerous shci workshops and struggling to develop a shared community knowledge base [53] have convinced us that these mechanisms are not enough to bring the shci community together, so instead we have attempted a different tactic here: to elaborate a vision. we are, in doing so, advocating the privileging of a particular perspective on sustainability that a) is sufficiently radical to enable us to affect root causes of unsustainability, and b) is focused enough to enable us to conceive of research activities to undertake in concert as a community. despite having spent so many years peeling back layers of the onion to discover added complexities and interconnections that make a singular definition of sustainability so elusive, there do appear to be points of leverage within klein’s conception of a sustainable future which, if we were to focus on these, would address the many and varied manifestations of unsustainability that would seem to motivate all researchers doing shci work. finally, we contend that ‘doing good’—the nebulous aim that unifies all definitions of sustainability [4, 59]—is a noble goal, but not especially useful for orienting an hci research agenda that challenges existing norms of hci research (don’t all researchers think they are contributing to a better world?), particularly when it requires each individual researcher to define what ‘good’ looks like. without a clear vision that can be communicated to hci more broadly, sustainability, and shci by extension, are easily dismissed as meaningless— as useful only in demarcating one’s inclusion in a a counterculture (e.g. tree-huggers) within hci. indeed, the moralizing connotations of the term sustainability when ill-defined has the potential to create a problematic us-versus-them culture within hci, with us playing the role of nuisance or ‘deviant’ [52]. we hope that articulating a pragmatic vision of what hci (notably, not just shci) needs to do to stay relevant in the project of realizing a sustainable future enables those who had been put off by sustainability rhetoric to understand the purpose of designing for sustainability within hci, and why they too should be involved in the effort.",468
Use the Right Sound for the Right Job: Verbal Commands and Auditory Icons for a Task-Management System Favor Different Information Processes in the Brain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657273,"design recommendations for notifications are typically based on user performance and subjective feedback. in comparison, there has been surprisingly little research on how designed notifications might be processed by the brain for the information they convey. the current study uses eeg/erp methods to evaluate auditory notifications that were designed to cue long-distance truck drivers for task-management and driving conditions, particularly for automated driving scenarios. two experiments separately evaluated naive students and professional truck drivers for their behavioral and brain responses to auditory notifications, which were either auditory icons or verbal commands. our eeg/erp results suggest that verbal commands were more readily recognized by the brain as relevant targets, but that auditory icons were more likely to update contextual working memory. both classes of notifications did not differ on behavioral measures. this suggests that auditory icons ought to be employed for communicating contextual information and verbal commands, for urgent requests. taken together, the current work contributes by showing that auditory notifications can be evaluated and functionally discriminated for how they are processed by the brain for information. this has implications for the operational context as well as design. choices for which notifications to use for which purpose can be based not only in terms of response times and discrimination accuracy, which is not necessarily the operational objective, but in terms of how the notifications are: (1) detected against the auditory scene, (2) discriminated against other notification targets, (3) likely to capture attention, and (4) capable of updating contextual working memory. to date, most studies have questioned whether verbal commands or auditory icons serve better as notifications, namely in terms of how well they elicit a speeded and accurate response. the current findings suggest that this question, while well-intentioned, is misplaced. our results demonstrate that verbal commands and auditory icons have different qualities. while verbal commands are better discriminated against other notifications, auditory icons can update contextual working memory with less effort. practically speaking, this suggests that verbal icons are ideally used for time-critical information where there is no leeway for ambiguity, e.g., collision warnings. meanwhile, auditory icons are likely to be more effective in communicating contextual information, such as entry into a poorly maintained road section or changing weather conditions. in other words, verbal commands and auditory icons should be used as complementary (and not competing) notifications. previous research has recommended using auditory icons to notify users of environmental events [17, 32]. more specifically, auditory icons have been suggested to enhance situational awareness [1, 31]. for example, a walking sound can more effectively indicate a nearing pedestrian. in addition, auditory icons might be favored because it is believed that they can be processed in parallel to other auditory events [1]. these findings so far converge with our current results and interpretation. nonetheless, there are works that do not. for example, contrary to our current believe, that verbal commands capture attention, some work have shown that certain auditory icons (i.e., car horn) result in significantly faster response times (e.g., [24]). we might account for this by the fact that some auditory icons are overlearned to indicate danger. it should be noted that verbal processing is known to differ for different word classes (i.e., verbs, nouns) [58, 67]. the current study only uses nouns for verbal commands and, thus, future studies should verify whether verbal commands attract attention preferentially for all word classes, relative to auditory icons. in this work, we present eeg/erp evidence that discriminates for how auditory icons and verbal commands are processed by the brain. nonetheless, we do not doubt that nuances in how auditory notifications are engineered could ultimately render an auditory icon attention-grabbing and/or a verbal command more suited for communicating context. our current results contribute by providing a starting point for understanding what type of sounds ought to be employed for which purposes, bearing in mind the brain’s likely response to them. the participants in experiment 1 possessed neither a language proficiency for the verbal commands nor an expert understanding of the operational tasks that the notifications indicated. therefore, the eeg/erp differences (i.e., p2, p3b) found between verbal commands and auditory icons can be considered as general differences between the two notification classes. in contrast, experiment 2 was performed on professional truck drivers in a highly realistic test environment. a comparison between the two experiments reveals that these differences in brain responses scale with realism and user proficiency. thus, the current approach of evaluating notification designs on the basis of brain responses is robust, even when behavioral responses do not differ. notifications that are first designed in sterile lab environments could also be evaluated for the eeg/erp responses that they elicit. this would narrow down the candidates for deployment and validation in high fidelity simulation environments or field-testing. besides this, eeg/erp methods could also be used to discriminate between different instantiation of the same target notification. one example would be to determine the preferability of semantically comparable verbal commands, such as tank or fuel. to conclude, the current work suggests that verbal commands and auditory icons serve different purposes, at least from the standpoint of how they are processed by the brain. thus, evaluations that directly compare them in terms of performance measures might not be appropriate. this might also explain the mixed evidence from previous studies in support of either auditory notifications. the growing accessibility of brain recording methods (i.e., eeg) mean that the current approach can be used to support finer functional discriminations for notifications and can be effectively deployed, even in challenging deployment scenarios such as high fidelity truck simulators.",469
Iris: A Conversational Agent for Complex Tasks,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657274,"today, most conversational agents are limited to simple tasks supported by standalone commands, such as getting directions or scheduling an appointment. to support more complex tasks, agents must be able to generalize from and combine the commands they already understand. this paper presents a new approach to designing conversational agents inspired by linguistic theory, where agents can execute complex requests interactively by combining commands through nested conversations. we demonstrate this approach in iris, an agent that can perform open-ended data science tasks such as lexical analysis and predictive modeling. to power iris, we have created a domain-specific language that transforms python functions into combinable automata and regulates their combinations through a type system. running a user study to examine the strengths and limitations of our approach, we find that data scientists completed a modeling task 2.6 times faster with iris than with jupyter notebook. in this paper, we show how conversational agents can draw on human conversational strategies to combine commands together, allowing them to assist us with tasks they have not been explicitly programmed to support. we showcase these ideas in iris, an agent designed to help users with data science and machine learning tasks. more broadly, our work demonstrates how simple models of conversation can lead to surprisingly complex emergent outcomes.",470
"Explaining Viewers' Emotional, Instrumental, and Financial Support Provision for Live Streamers",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657285,"on live streams, viewers can support streamers through various methods ranging from well-wishing text messages to money. in this study (n=230) we surveyed viewers who had given money to a streamer. we identified six motivations for why they gave money to their favorite live streamer. we then examined how factors related to viewer, streamer, and viewer-streamer interaction were associated with three forms of social support provision: emotional, instrumental, and financial support. our main findings are: parasocial relationship was consistently correlated with all three types of social support, while social presence was only related with instrumental and financial support; interpersonal attractiveness was associated with emotional and instrumental support and lonely people were more likely to give instrumental support. our focus on various types of social support in a live streaming masspersonal platform adds a more detailed understanding to the existing literature of mediated social support. furthermore, it suggests potential directions for designing more supportive and interactive live streaming platforms. is giving money to one’s favorite live streamer a charitable donation, compensation for entertainment/education services, or form of social support? when asking people who have already given money to streamers in the past, our qualitative results found that viewers had wide range of reasons on why they gave money to streamers in the past. some viewed the financial exchange as extremely transactional (e.g., paying for what i received as a service) while others associated emotional connections and care with their monetary contribution. using a social support lens to distinguish emotional, instrumental, and financial support, we asked participants how willing they would be to offer these different types of social support in the future. our statistical models indicate that social presence is an indicator of tangible support intentions—both instrumental and financial—and parasocial relationships are a positive predictor of all three support types. our focus on live streaming as a unique, masspersonal platform for varied types of social support provision builds on literature of social support in mediated social systems and especially adds to our understanding of tangible support provision (i.e., instrumental and financial support), which is relatively understudied compared to information or emotional support. with more individuals becoming part time or full time live streamers, as well as the growing utilization of live streaming for online shopping experiences, fundraising, and education, we hope that our findings will be the starting point of increased interest in the tangible aspects of social support from both applied and theoretical perspectives.",471
Making the News: Digital Creativity Support for Journalists,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657286,"this paper reports the design and first evaluations of new digital support for journalists to discover and examine crea-tive angles on news stories under development. the support integrated creative news search algorithms, interactive crea-tive sparks and reusable concept cards into one daily work tool of journalists. the first evaluations of inject by jour-nalists in their places of work to write published news sto-ries revealed that the journalists generated new angles on existing stories rather than new stories, changed their writ-ing behaviour, and reported evidence that inject use had the potential to increase the objectivity and the boldness of journalism methods used. as such, journalist use of inject was effective, but not to the degree that the tool was designed to support. journalist use of inject also provided more effective support for writing feature stories rather than news stories, although this finding might have been influenced by inject’s data layer, which was only composed of past news rather than current social media information. however, writing feature stories will still require journalists to exhibit more creative thinking than during the evaluations, by applying more creativity skills when using inject than was reported. results revealed that use of inject offered more support to journalists when discovering rather than examining [26]. it appeared to contribute to journalists being more ambitious and to overcome biases by retrieving topic information from alternative news sources and discovering new stances from which to investigate news topics. however, this support for discovering also led journalists to compare inject, sometimes unfavorably, to google search, a comparison reinforced by some of the journalists using google search after inject to seek more information on new angles. at least some of the journalists might have expected inject to discover the information that was needed, rather than just to offer creative support with this information, as inject was designed to do. although subsequent versions of inject now embed google search to support journalists, to help to distinguish between discovering a new angle with inject capabilities and retrieving more information afterwards, journalists will still need to apply more creativity skills to exploit inject’s capabilities effectively. the reported uses of inject did not appear to deliver and/or encourage sufficient use of these skills. results also revealed that use of inject supported some of the journalists to recognize known news information at the time that news stories are being written. indeed, different news organizations have identified the potential of inject to unlock their own news archives for creative use, to enhance productivity as well as creativity, but only if inject can support journalists to recognize [5] related news quickly when writing stories. new recommendation features will be needed to support such recognition.",472
Visual ODLs: Co-Designing Patient-Generated Observations of Daily Living to Support Data-Driven Conversations in Pediatric Care,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657287,"teens with complex chronic illnesses have difficulty understanding and articulating symptoms such as pain and emotional distress. yet, symptom communication plays a central role in clinical care and illness management. to understand how design can help overcome these challenges, we created a visual library of 72 sketched illustrations, informed by the observations of daily living framework along with insights from 11 clinician interviews. we utilized our library with storyboarding techniques, free-form sketching, and interviews, in co-design sessions with 13 pairs of chronically-ill teens and their parents. we found that teens depicted symptoms as being interwoven with narratives of personal and social identity. teens and parents were enthusiastic about collaboratively-generated, interactive storyboards as a tracking and communication mechanism, and suggested three ways in which they could aid in communication and coordination with informal and formal caregivers. in this paper, we detail these findings, to guide the design of tools for symptom-tracking and incorporation of patient-generated data into pediatric care. in this paper, we introduce visual odls and examine its use as design artifacts to elicit complexities of symptomrelated communication faced by teens with complex chronic illnesses. through co-design activities to envision digital storyboarding technology with visual odls, we generated storyboards representing the teens' reconstructions of their felt experiences. the material presence of visual odls provided scaffolds to structure in-depth discussions about how to foster communication with both family and clinical caregivers using patient-defined and patient-generated data. our future work will examine approaches to semiautomated tracking in the space of collaborative construction of visual odls and storyboarding. a central design tension includes the need to reduce the burden placed on a user experiencing illness, while enabling full expressive capabilities to capture and represent their felt experience.",473
Improving Discoverability and Expert Performance in Force-Sensitive Text Selection for Touch Devices with Mode Gauges,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657288,"text selection on touch devices can be a difficult task for users. letters and words are often too small to select directly, and the enhanced interaction techniques provided by the os -- magnifiers, selection handles, and methods for selecting at the character, word, or sentence level -- often lead to as many usability problems as they solve. the introduction of force-sensitive touchscreens has added another enhancement to text selection (using force for different selection modes); however, these modes are difficult to discover and many users continue to struggle with accurate selection. in this paper we report on an investigation of the design of touch-based and force-based text selection mechanisms, and describe two novel text-selection techniques that provide improved discoverability, enhanced visual feedback, and a higher performance ceiling for experienced users. two evaluations show that one design successfully combined support for novices and experts, was never worse than the standard ios technique, and was preferred by participants. text selection on touch devices can be a difficult task, and even with several augmentations (e.g. callout magnifiers, selection handles, or word / sentence / paragraph snapping), the task can still frustrate users. the introduction of forcesensitive touchscreens has added another enhancement to text selection (using pressure for different selection modes); however, these modes are difficult to discover and many users continue to struggle with accurate selection. in this paper we reported on an investigation of the design of touch-based and pressure-based text selection mechanisms, and describe a design framework and two novel text-selection techniques that provide improved discoverability and enhanced visual feedback using a ”mode gauge” visualization, and have design features intended to support a higher performance ceiling for experts as well as smooth transitions from novice use. we carried out two studies to evaluate the new techniques. the first study showed that the new techniques (and one in particular, called fs) performed well compared to the standard ios technique, were never worse than the standard method, and were strongly preferred by participants. a second study that focused on discoverability showed that the gauge visualization was instrumental in helping users explore the range of functionality provided by the new techniques, and that the pressure features of the standard technique were difficult to discover. our work shows the value of careful attention to design details and underlying principles such as affordances, discoverability, and transitions - even for seemingly-simple interactions like text selection.",474
Vibrational Artificial Subtle Expressions: Conveying System's Confidence Level to Users by Means of Smartphone Vibration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657289,"artificial subtle expressions (ases) are machine-like expressions used to convey a system's confidence level to users intuitively. so far, auditory ases using beep sounds, visual ases using leds, and motion ases using robot movements have been implemented and shown to be effective. in this paper, we propose a novel type of ase that uses vibration (vibrational ases). we implemented the vibrational ases on a smartphone and conducted experiments to confirm whether they can convey a system's confidence level to users in the same way as the other types of ases. the results clearly showed that vibrational ases were able to accurately and intuitively convey the designed confidence level to participants, demonstrating that ases can be applied in a variety of applications in real environments. in this paper, we proposed a novel type of ase that uses vibration, called vibrational ases. we implemented the vibrational ases on a smartphone and conducted experiments to confirm whether they can convey a system’s confidence level to users in the same way as the other types of ases. the results clearly showed that vibrational ases were able to accurately and intuitively convey the designed confidence level to the participants. on the basis of the results of this study, we found a wide variety of future research directions. first, we would like to investigate the effectiveness of combining various kinds of main protocols and different ases because this study was focused on only the combination of verbal suggestions and vibrational ases. we can currently use various kinds of ases, e.g., auditory, visual, motion, and vibrational ones, so considering appropriate combinations of various kinds of main protocols and different ases would expand the applicability of the ases. second, we are also considering expanding the variety of expressions of vibrational ases. specifically, we are considering using “increasing ases” as a new variation of ase and different transition patterns for increasing or decreasing ases in linear or logarithmic ways. based on former studies of vibration information in human-computer interaction [26,27], various on/off patterns or different frequencies of vibrations would be possible candidates. these new expressions could convey a system’s confidence levels in much more detail or other kinds of information to users. in parallel with the above rather fundamental investigation, we are also curious about concrete applications of vibrational ases. for example, the vibrations could be implemented not only in smart devices but in the handles or levers that users are holding. this means that vibrational ases can be applied for most driving or operating consoles, e.g., cars, trains, planes, heavy machines, and cranes. considering how to apply vibrational ases into these realistic applications would be our next target, e.g., a car navigation system expressing decreasing vibrational ases together with speech like “this route a would be faster than route b if there was no snow on it” in a cold morning in winter. in this study, we focused on a situation in which a user is holding a smartphone. we are now curious about much more ubiquitous situations, like when a user is wearing smart glasses and a smart watch and holding a smartphone. in this situation, there would be a suitable information modality for each device, e.g., visual ases are good for glasses, so it is very exciting to consider how to apply various kinds of ases in such situations.",475
Investigating the Effect of the Multiple Comparisons Problem in Visual Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657280,"the goal of a visualization system is to facilitate dataset-driven insight discovery. but what if the insights are spurious? features or patterns in visualizations can be perceived as relevant insights, even though they may arise from noise. we often compare visualizations to a mental image of what we are interested in: a particular trend, distribution or an unusual pattern. as more visualizations are examined and more comparisons are made, the probability of discovering spurious insights increases. this problem is well-known in statistics as the multiple comparisons problem (mcp) but overlooked in visual analysis. we present a way to evaluate mcp in visualization tools by measuring the accuracy of user reported insights on synthetic datasets with known ground truth labels. in our experiment, over 60% of user insights were false. we show how a confirmatory analysis approach that accounts for all visual comparisons, insights and non-insights, can achieve similar results as one that requires a validation dataset. comparing a visualization to a mental image is akin to performing a statistical test, thus repeated interpretation of visualizations is susceptible to the mcp. in this work we attempted to empirically characterize this. we presented an experiment based on synthetically generated datasets that enabled us to assess the correctness of user reported insigths. we showed that by not accounting for all visual comparisons made during visual data exploration, false discovery rates will be inflated even after validating user insights with further statistical testing. we demonstrated that a confirmatory approach that addresses this can provide similar statistical guarentees to one that uses a validation dataset.",476
Passenger Trip Planning using Ride-Sharing Services,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657281,"ride-sharing can potentially address transportation challenges such as traffic congestion and air pollution by letting drivers share their cars unused capacity with a number of passengers. however, even though multiple ride-sharing services exist and hci research has investigated various aspects of their use, we still have limited knowledge on how passengers use ride-sharing services to plan their trips. in this paper, we study how passengers use existing services to support the activity of planning a trip. we report from a qualitative study where we participated in 5 rides and conducted interviews with 19 passengers about their use and opinions towards ride-sharing services. we found that planning a ride involves comparing individual preferences across a number of services which enabled participants to support finding a trip and handle challenges such as privacy and trust. further, we discuss these findings and their implications for future hci research in ride-sharing. in this paper, we presented an empirical study of 19 passengers of ride-sharing and their use of ride-sharing services to plan their trips. through analysis of a mixedmethods study with 5 ride participations, 5 planning observations and 10 semi-structured interviews we identified six themes that describe how ride-sharing passengers are planning their trips and which preferences they have for a specific ride. our findings describe how our participants didn't only use individual services to plan their rides. surprisingly, they planned their rides across a number of ride-sharing services which enabled them to handle some of the challenges they had in planning their rides such as finding a ride with the right price and with a trusted driver. to inspire further research in hci with ride-sharing, we have discussed our findings under three headings of facilitating detour and partial rides, supporting passenger trust and privacy, and interaction with multiple services. we have discussed the implications of our findings and suggested that hci research consider multi-device interaction as an important addition to ride-sharing services. while we believe that our study provides insights into how passengers use ride-sharing platforms, we also acknowledge that driver experiences would be valuable to provide different perspectives on topics such as multi-device interaction. we therefore suggest further work investigating these dynamics, for example, how drivers and passengers engage in collaborative ride-sharing.",477
Infrastructuring the Solidarity Economy: Unpacking Strategies and Tactics in Designing Social Innovation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657282,"solidarity organizations in europe are committed to building a more socially just society through a better configuration of democracy, politics and economy. in this paper, we describe our efforts to contribute to the socio-political designed innovation of solidarity movements through the establishment of a research lab embedded in, and operating within, the solidarity economy. we describe three cases that span the polarities of everyday and expert design, and contribute to the scaling out of social innovations. we use these cases to exemplify the strategies and tactics that emerge from the ongoing negotiation of 'infrastructuring' work with solidarity organizations. finally, we discuss how guerilla infrastructuring, designing coalitions, and spanning design polarities can contribute to hci and design for social innovation more generally. in this work, we conceptualized sms as spaces of designed social innovation in which designers of various competences creatively action their collective design capacities. crucially, we emphasized the necessary negotiations of diverse strategies for the creation of common tactics that allow such innovations to materialize. through ola, we reported on our own negotiations for engaging in technologically infrastructuring such alternative political and economic realities. in the discussion of this paper we call researchers to mirror the innovation of sms and creatively action our own design capacities by engaging in guerilla infrastructuring, creating design coalitions and spanning design polarities, for an hci concerned with radically alternative, more socially just societies and economies.",478
Exploring Co-design with Breastfeeding Mothers,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657283,"designing mobile applications for breastfeeding mothers can be challenging; creating spaces to foster co-design -- when a mother's primary focus is on her child rather than on design activities - is even more so. in this paper we discuss the development of the milk matters mobile application, a tool developed to motivate women to donate their surplus breast milk to the local milk bank. we look at the importance of different approaches to understanding the mothers, comparing workshops, surveys, and cultural probes. through our work we identify three factors to consider when co-designing with and for mothers: 1) interrupted interactions 2) elements that might distract a baby and 3) the importance of empowering mothers through positive reinforcement. based on these factors we examine our methodological approaches, suggesting ways to make future research with breastfeeding mothers more productive. in this paper we used a co-design approach to elicit the requirements and needed features for an application used by breastfeeding mothers. design considerations included: 1) interrupted interactions 2) elements that might distract a baby and 3) the importance of empowering mothers through positive reinforcement. this approach has been especially important in this context, where the constraints of nursing young children affect how mothers interact with their phones and with milk matters, as well as their participation and availability for this project. thus far the mobile application has met the expectations of both milk matters and their donor mothers, based on the predominantly positive feedback we received. co-design as an approach seeks to bring to the surface some of the design constraints and considerations that might be obvious to the end users (e.g. breastfeeding mothers), but would not be apparent to the average software designer or hci researcher. these non-functional requirements can make the difference between applications with very little adoption and those that are actually taken up and used by the target population. while it is too soon to establish whether this approach has succeeded, our initial surveys and cultural probes indicate that we are on the right track.",479
The Dream is Collapsing: The Experience of Exiting VR,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657284,"research on virtual reality (vr) has studied users' experience of immersion, presence, simulator sickness, and learning effects. however, the momentary experience of exiting vr and transitioning back to the real-world is not well understood. do users become self-conscious of their actions upon exit? are users nervous of their surroundings? using explicitation interviews, we explore the moment of exit from vr across four applications. analysis of the interviews reveals five components of experience: space, control, sociality, time, and sensory adaptation. participants described spatial disorientation, for example, regardless of the complexity of the vr scene. participants also described a window across which they exit vr, for example mentally first and then physically. we present six designs for easing or heightening the exit experience, as described by the participants. based on these findings, we further discuss the ?moment of exit' as an opportunity for designing engaging and enhanced vr experiences. we explored the moment of exit in vr. other aspects of the experience of vr are well understood, from presence to the aftereffects of vr. however, the momentary experience of exiting vr is not well understood and may yet represent a new experiential space that can be designed for. we explored the moment of exit across four different vr experiences. twenty-four participants described aspects of spatial awareness, control, sociality, sensory adaptations and details of the precise temporal moment of exit. participants also described changes to vr (both within the virtual and the real environments) that may both heighten and lessen the experience of exiting vr and speculated as to the experience of these. with a better understanding of the moment of exit in vr, it may become possible for the experience of vr to be extended beyond the view within the headset. some research is exploring this already, with haptic extensions [3] for example. however, with a clearer understanding we can design transitions that heighten scary experiences, facilitate spatial security through gradual exits, or better control the users’ lasting impression of the experience.",480
Common Barriers to the Use of Patient-Generated Data Across Clinical Settings,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657295,"patient-generated data, such as data from wearable fitness trackers and smartphone apps, are viewed as a valuable information source towards personalised healthcare. however, studies in specific clinical settings have revealed diverse barriers to their effective use. in this paper, we address the following question: are there barriers prevalent across distinct workflows in clinical settings to using patient-generated data? we conducted a two-part investigation: a literature review of studies identifying such barriers; and interviews with clinical specialists across multiple roles, including emergency care, cardiology, mental health, and general practice. we identify common barriers in a six-stage workflow model of aligning patient and clinician objectives, judging data quality, evaluating data utility, rearranging data into a clinical format, interpreting data, and deciding on a plan or action. this workflow establishes common ground for hci practitioners and researchers to explore solutions to improving the use of patient-generated data in clinical practices. this paper contributes an understanding of barriers to the use of patient-generated data in clinical settings, derived from a synthesis of existing literature and interviews conducted with thirteen healthcare professionals from several common clinical roles. our findings suggest that, while the specific challenges pertaining to the use of patient-generated data vary considerably across clinical settings, these barriers occur along stages of a common workflow. we thus proposed a six-stage workflow model of patient-generated data use, which includes stages relating to data capture, quality, utility, structure, interpretation, and finally application in a plan of action. based on this model, we discussed potential ways that these barriers might be addressed through the design of tools for improved data capture (to support later clinical use), improved interpretability by clinicians, and support for joint sense-making with patients. finally, we discussed the role of the increased use of patient-generated data in the shift towards participatory care, in particular the need to consider changes in clinical workflows and it systems. an important outcome of the use of patient-generated data in clinical settings is the increased collaboration between doctor and patient in managing care. this has the twin benefits of reducing patient dependence on the clinician, thereby empowering the patient to improve their health and wellbeing. we do not claim that our findings are sufficient for understanding precise workflows in individual clinical settings, but the broad range of clinical settings does afford an understanding of the broader use of patient-generated data. by providing future hci research with pathways to address these barriers, our findings can engender improved collaboration between patient and clinician in decision-making, as well as improved clinical outcomes.",481
Analyzing the Effect of Avatar Self-Similarity on Men and Women in a Search and Rescue Game,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657296,"a crucial aspect of virtual gaming experiences is the avatar: the player's virtual self-representation. while research has demonstrated benefits to using self-similar avatars in some virtual experiences, such avatars sometimes produce a more negative experience for women. to help researchers and game designers assess the cost-benefit tradeoffs of self-similar avatars, we compared players' performance and subjective experience in a search and rescue computer game when using two different photorealistic avatars: their own self or a friend, and when playing either a social (rescuing people) or a nonsocial (rescuing gems) version of the game. there was no effect of avatar appearance on players' performance or subjective experience in either game version, but we also found that women's experience with self-similar avatars was no more negative than men's. our results suggest that avatar appearance may not make a difference to players in certain game contexts. in this work, we present findings from a study comparing performance and subjective experience in a search and rescue game where participants played as an avatar that looked like either themselves or a friend. we predicted that using a self-similar avatar would improve players’ performance and subjective experience, especially in a version of the game with a social element (rescuing people instead of gems). in addition, we predicted that males would have a more positive experience when playing as a self-similar avatar than females. we found no effect of avatar appearance on performance or experience, even in the version of the game with a social element, suggesting that avatar appearance may not matter much to players in games like ours that do not include a substantial amount of direct social interaction, however, we also found no difference between the subjective experience of males and females when playing as a self-similar avatar, indicating that the negative effects of self-similar avatars for females observed in previous work may simply be due to the use of lower fidelity avatars that do a poor job of representing physical features that matter most to female players. these findings demonstrate the importance of carefully considering the extent to which high fidelity self-similar avatars align with the purpose and structure of an interactive experience before deciding whether it is worth the investment of time and money to implement them.",482
Supporting Rhythm Activities of Deaf Children using Music-Sensory-Substitution Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657297,"rhythm is the first musical concept deaf people learn in music classes. however, hearing loss limits the amount of information that allows a deaf person to evaluate his or her performance and stay in sync with other musicians. in this paper, we investigated how a visual and vibrotactile music-sensory-substitution device, muss-bits++, affects rhythm discrimination, reproduction, and expressivity of deaf people. we conducted a controlled study with 11 deaf children and found that most participants felt more confident wearing the device in vibration mode even when it did not objectively improve their accuracy. furthermore, we studied how muss-bits++ can be used in music classes at deaf schools and what challenges and opportunities arise in such a setting. based on these studies, we discuss insights and future directions that support the design and development of music-sensory-substitution systems for music making. in this paper, we investigated how muss-bits++, a musicsensory-substitution systems for music-making, affects rhythm perception. we first interviewed a music teacher from a deaf school and identified that communicating rhythm information is a challenging task. in a controlled study, we found that participants with musical background perceived muss-bits++’s vibrations as making the task easier, though no significant difference in their performance was observed. we argued that this could be due to two reasons: (1) they need time to learn how to use the feedback from muss-bits++, or (2) the mapping we provided is not matching the mapping they need to improve their accuracy. furthermore, in music lessons that were conducted by a music teacher from a deaf school, the teacher observed, and the participants agreed, that it was easier for the participants to understand the music teacher’s instructions. furthermore, collaborative synchronization activities among three participants with the music teacher were observed to work better with muss-bits++ compared to the same activity without muss-bits++. we believe that music-sensorysubstitution systems hold a lot of potential for music-making and hope that this work will help other researchers to develop our vision further.",483
Traces: Studying a Public Reactive Floor-Projection of Walking Trajectories to Support Social Awareness,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657298,"walking trajectories have been used to understand how users interact with public displays. however, it has not yet been studied how displaying them in-situ could affect users' awareness about others' presence and activities. we present the study of an interactive public floor-projection called traces. traces projects the walking trajectories of individuals as they pass through the lobby of a university building. we investigated traces through a 6 week in-field study. our results outline how different uses and understandings of traces contributed towards its appropriation as a glanceable display for social awareness. we outline design suggestions that future designers should consider to support social awareness with public displays. our study of traces has explored how social awareness and feelings of connection within a community can be enhanced by in-situ visualisation of low-level human activity. by supporting multiple different ways to interact, use of traces was sustained over the study. this allowed rich appropriation, but without the display dominating the main use of the space. traces allowed individuals to explore activities and social practices of the design factory, and appropriate a range of personal uses from relatively basic data. these, enhancing curiosity and engaging a connection with the lived environment and others in it.",484
Exploring Accessible Smartwatch Interactions for People with Upper Body Motor Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657299,"smartwatches are always-available, provide quick access to information in a mobile setting, and can collect continuous health and fitness data. however, the small interaction space of these wearables may pose challenges for people with upper body motor impairments. to investigate accessible smartwatch interactions for this user group, we conducted two studies. first, we assessed the accessibility of existing smartwatch gestures with 10 participants with motor impairments. we found that not all participants were able to complete button, swipe and tap interactions. in a second study, we adopted a participatory approach to explore smartwatch gesture preferences and to gain insight into alternative, more accessible smartwatch interaction techniques. eleven participants with motor impairments created gestures for 16 common smartwatch actions on both touchscreen and non-touchscreen (bezel, wristband) areas of the watch and the user's body. we present results from both studies and provide design recommendations. we presented two studies to explore accessible smartwatch interactions for people with upper body motor impairments. in the first study, we assessed the accessibility of existing smartwatch interactions and found that participants experienced challenges performing existing gestures, including taps. in the second study, we explored alternative smartwatch interactions by asking participants to elicit gestures on the touchscreen and non-touchscreen areas for 16 common smartwatch actions. we found that the physical abilities of the participants influenced location preferences, such as the desire to choose non-touchscreen locations close to dominant hand, and that the small touchscreen size created the need to explore alternative gestures for some standard actions (e.g., pinch-to-zoom). lastly, we presented design guidelines for more accessible smartwatch input.",485
Pseudonymous Parents: Comparing Parenting Roles and Identities on the Mommit and Daddit Subreddits,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657290,"gender equality between mothers and fathers is critical for the social and economic wellbeing of children, mothers, and families. over the past 50 years, gender roles have begun to converge, with mothers doing more work outside of the home and fathers doing more domestic work. however, popular parenting sites in the u.s. continue to be heavily gendered. we explore parenting roles and identities on the platform reddit.com which is used by both mothers and fathers. we draw on seven years of data from three major parenting subreddits-parenting, mommit, and daddit-to investigate what topics parents discuss on reddit and how they vary across parenting subreddits. we find some similarities in topics across the three boards, such as sleep training, as well as differences, such as fathers talking about custody cases and halloween. we discuss the role of pseudonymity for providing parents with a platform to discuss sensitive parenting topics. we conclude by highlighting the benefits of both gender-inclusive and role-specific parenting boards. this work provides a roadmap for using computational techniques to understand parenting practices online at large scale.",486

Enabling the Participation of People with Parkinson's and their Caregivers in Co-Inquiry around Collectivist Health Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657292,"while user participation is central to hci, co-inquiry takes this further by having participants direct and control research from conceptualisation to completion. we describe a co-inquiry, conducted over 16 months with a parkinson's support group. we explored how the participation of members might be enabled across multiple stages of a research project, from the generation of research questions to the development of a prototype. participants directed the research into developing alternative modes of information provision, resulting in 'parkinson's radio' -- a collectivist health information service produced and edited by members of the support group. we reflect on how we supported participation at different stages of the project and the successes and challenges faced by the team. we contribute insights into the design of collectivist health technologies for this group, and discuss opportunities and tensions for conducting co-inquiry in hci research. in this paper we described a co-inquiry conducted in collaboration with members of a parkinson’s support group. we outlined the generation of a research challenge, which focused on creating accessible, offline information resources that allow people to share experiences of parkinson’s and ask questions surrounding a range of topics. our reflections provide unique insights into the challenges and successes that co-inquiry can elicit. further work is required to explore how systems might support the creation of community information services in the future. the fact that participants were not involved in the data collection or analysis during the project is a limitation of this work, yet a reality of working with participants who might be prone to fatigue or ill health. however, future work of this kind could consider lightweight methods for enhancing engagement within these types of research activities. there is a possibility that encouraging participants to take and share notes during and between workshops could be an approach to take in the future.",488
"Who Provides Phishing Training?: Facts, Stories, and People Like Me",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657293,"humans represent one of the most persistent vulnerabilities in many computing systems. since human users are independent agents who make their own choices, closing these vulnerabilities means persuading users to make different choices. focusing on one specific human choice -- clicking on a link in a phishing email -- we conducted an experiment to identify better ways to train users to make more secure decisions. we compared traditional facts-and-advice training against training that uses a simple story to convey the same lessons. we found a surprising interaction effect: facts-and-advice training works better than not training users, but only when presented by a security expert. stories don't work quite as well as facts-and-advice, but work much better when told by a peer. this suggests that the perceived origin of training materials can have a surprisingly large effect on security outcomes. phishing remains one of the more widely used methods for exploiting human vulnerabilities today. training users to recognize and avoid clicking on links in phishing emails is a large and important business today. we compared two major methods of conducting this training: providing facts-andadvice about phishing, or providing stories of previous victims of phishing. while both can contain the same lessons for end users, we found a surprising interaction effect: facts-andadvice led to lower click rates when appearing to come from an expert, but stories led to lower click rates when appearing to come from peers rather than experts. we discussed competing potential explanations for this interaction effect, but cannot concretely explain it",489
Unpacking Perceptions of Data-Driven Inferences Underlying Online Targeting and Personalization,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657294,"much of what a user sees browsing the internet, from ads to search results, is targeted or personalized by algorithms that have made inferences about that user. prior work has documented that users find such targeting simultaneously useful and creepy. we begin unpacking these conflicted feelings through two online studies. in the first study, 306 participants saw one of ten explanations for why they received an ad, reflecting prevalent methods of targeting based on demographics, interests, and other factors. the type of interest-based targeting described in the explanation affected participants' comfort with the targeting and perceptions of its usefulness. we conducted a follow-up study in which 237 participants saw ten interests companies might infer. both the sensitivity of the interest category and participants' actual interest in that topic significantly impacted their attitudes toward inferencing. our results inform the design of transparency tools. we believe our results will be valuable in designing the next generation of transparency tools and setting best practices for inferencing. participants in study 1 were more comfortable with targeting based on all site visitors’ aggregate interests, rather than interests inferred about them in particular. assuming user-specific targeting continues, these results suggest the need for clearer notice about such practices. explanations about targeting on users’ own demographics or interests were considered more informative than the explanation which only mentioned an algorithm. that is, participants found the general explanation of an algorithm doing the personalization opaque. several participants asked to know what information was being used in the algorithm and where it had been collected. we thus suggest that future transparency tools more clearly identify the method and parameters of targeting, not just that targeting is occurring. the power of big data rests in its ability to unearth hidden correlations buried in large amounts of data. this can lead to an advertisement being targeted based on interests that, to humans, seem unrelated to the ad, yet accurately capture the algorithm’s training data and its inherent biases. in contrast, our participants considered advertising through straightforward inferences to be more useful than advertising through inferences about unrelated interests. participants also found explanations about straightforward inferences more informative. many participants felt that the logical jump from an interest in one topic to an interest in an unrelated product necessitated further explanation or justification. future research could investigate whether greater transparency about the steps from an inference to personalization improves perceptions of the usefulness of targeting or informativeness of privacy notices. we also compared reactions to an ad explicitly placed on a site and an ad targeted via an algorithm. our participants found the first method more fair, but the second more useful, in large part because it seemed more likely to show relevant ads. this tension between fairness and usefulness echoes prior work [46]. in response, future transparency tools, both self-regulatory (e.g., adchoices) and community-developed (e.g., browser plugins), could provide users with step-by-step explanations of inferences made about them and how those inferences are used for targeting. the particular interest categories on which an ad was targeted (rather than just that targeting was based on prior browsing) should be revealed. these recommendations contrast with widely used vague explanations. in study 2, inference topics were not equal in participants’ eyes. the 160 google adwords interest topics that we presented to participants in study 2 led to a gradient, not a bimodal distribution, of comfort, in contrast to companies’ policies that only grant special consideration to a small list of highly sensitive topics [17]. future work should critically re-examine the bifurcation of topics into sensitive and nonsensitive categories, perhaps creating a targeting-privacy calculus that takes the inference’s sensitivity into account both when making an inference and targeting based on that topic. while some companies are open about what topics they use for personalization [18], our detailed results on topic sensitivity can also inform industry-wide best practices for making inferences about topics. the range of comfort ratings across inferences suggests that users may benefit from more fine-tuned controls over which inferences about them are used to target ads. additionally, ad buyers should be informed of the sensitivity of different categories so they can make more informed purchasing decisions to avoid alienating customers [39, 41]. echoing prior work [7], we found that the accuracy of an inferred interest also plays a major role in user comfort. regardless of the sensitivity of the topic, participants were more comfortable with accurate inferences being used for personalizing their online experience. this finding harkens back to the idea of privacy distortion, which specifies that inaccurate information about an individual is as much of a privacy violation as accurate information. while some companies have created privacy dashboards, our findings about the importance of inferencing accuracy on user attitudes emphasizes the need for improved privacy dashboards and greater access. participants also reported different levels of comfort with their interests being known by different social relations. since ads may reflect a user’s private browsing history or sensitive interests [2], different ad settings could be available at work, on shared computers, and at certain times of day.",490
"Inaccuracy Blindness in Collaboration Persists, even with an Evaluation Prompt",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657205,"the tendency to believe and act on others' misinformation is documented in much prior work. this paper focuses on inaccuracy blindness, the tendency to take a collaborator's poor information at face value, which reduces problem-solving success. we draw on social psychological research from the 1970s showing that evaluative rating scales can prompt a change in perspective. in a series of studies, we prototyped and tested an evaluation prompt meant to encourage skepticism in participant detectives trying to identify a serial killer. in tests of the prototype, the prompt was partially successful in inducing skepticism (exp. 1), but a larger study (exp. 2) showed that, despite the evaluation prompt, participants' inaccuracy blindness persisted. this work, and the literature more generally, shows that the tendency to be misled by collaborators' inaccurate information remains a strong phenomenon that is hard to counteract and remains a significant challenge for the chi community. online collaborations and workgroups that include strangers, revolving membership, partners or advisors with social credentials but perhaps unknown expertise, and work done over distributed time and space, are more prevalent than ever. these interactions in today’s world are unavoidable and their value is undeniable, but the risks of having collaborators who provide sloppy, false, misleading, or inaccurate information have increased as well. although there are documented real world cases of the impact of poor collaboration (including collaboration failures that did not prevent the 911 attacks), and prior work has called out the problem of misinformation from others [9, 19] and identified the existence of inaccuracy blindness in small collaborations [13], the current work advances our understanding of inaccuracy blindness and contributes to the chi community a new idea for remediation and controlled experimentation on the remedy. this work demonstrates inaccuracy blindness persisted despite a prompt that went well beyond a simple warning—it required the participants to attend to and evaluate their partner’s information. thus we document the strength of inaccuracy blindness in collaborations and challenge our community to address this problem. doing so at the level required might risk undermining collaboration ties, so it is a difficult challenge but would be one important step in solving the larger misinformation problem faced by our society.",491
Huggable: The Impact of Embodiment on Promoting Socio-emotional Interactions for Young Pediatric Inpatients,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657206,"most hospitals make efforts to provide socio-emotional support for patients and their families during care. in order to expand the service provided by certified child life specialists, we created a social robot and a virtual avatar that augment part of the care ccls offers to patients by engaging pediatric patients in playful interactions and promoting their socio-emotional wellbeing. we ran a randomized controlled trial in a form of a wizard-of-oz study at a local pediatric hospital to study how three different interactive media (a plush teddy bear, a virtual agent on a screen, and a social robot) influence the pediatric patient's affect, joyful play, and social interactions with others. behavioral analyses of verbal utterance transcriptions and children's physical behavior revealed that the social robot is most effective in producing socially energetic conversations as well as increasing positivity and promoting multi-party interactions. the virtual avatar was socially engaging but children tended to attend more exclusively to a virtual avatar and were less responsive to others. the plush toy was least engaging of the three interventions, but children touched it the most. based on these findings, we recommend use cases for each agent appropriate for individual pediatric patients' health conditions and needs. these analyses of behavioral data suggest the benefit of deploying a physically embodied social robot in pediatric inpatient-care contexts on young patients'; social and emotional wellbeing. many young children in a hospital suffer psychological distress from isolation and loneliness. the negative affect often leads to uncooperative behavior toward medical staff and poor health outcomes. in order to expand the service provided by certified child life specialists, we developed interactive technologies and ran an experimental study that investigates the application of three companion-like agents as part of pediatric in-patient care context. with the developed system, a randomized clinical study was conducted to study the impact of a social robot, a virtual avatar and a plush toy on social and emotional engagement between the patient, the child life specialist, and co-present families. the behavioral analyses of recorded video footage and verbal utterance transcriptions revealed that a social robot could facilitate socially energetic and positive conversations more effectively than a virtual character and a plush toy. children’s gaze and touch behavior also support that a physically embodied social robot promotes the child-clinical staff-family member interactions better than a virtual avatar or a plush toy. these findings are significant because the increased positive emotion and social engagement are associated with positive patient outcomes. on the other hand, a virtual avatar received more exclusive attention from children, which could potentially benefit patients by distracting them from painful on-going medical procedures. finally, children who do not feel well enough to engage in social interactions could gain comfort from physically engaging with the plush toy. based on our results, we suggest that social robots could potentially play a significant role in improving young patients hospital experience by positively engaging children as well as reducing their feelings of isolation through various types of playful social interactions. these findings provide an important foundation to guide the ongoing development of effective pediatric-companion technologies for hospitalized children and their families to augment ccls and to improve patient’s socio-emotional well-being.",492
Forte: User-Driven Generative Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657207,"low-cost fabrication machines (e.g., 3d printers) offer the promise of creating custom-designed objects by a range of users. to maximize performance, generative design methods such as topology optimization can automatically optimize properties of a design based on high-level specifications. though promising, such methods require people to map their design ideas--often unintuitively--to a small number of mathematical input parameters, and the relationship between those parameters and a generated design is often unclear, making it difficult to iterate a design. we present forte, a sketch-based, real-time interactive tool for people to directly express and iterate on their designs via 2d topology optimization. users can ask the system to add structures, provide a variation with better performance, or optimize internal material layouts. users can globally control how much to 'deviate' from the initial sketch, or perform local suggestive editing, which interactively prompts the system to update based on the new information. design sessions with 10 participants demonstrate that forte empowers designers to create and explore a range of optimized designs with custom forms and styles.",493
PolarTrack: Optical Outside-In Device Tracking that Exploits Display Polarization,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657208,"polartrack is a novel camera-based approach to detecting and tracking mobile devices inside the capture volume. in polartrack, a polarization filter continuously rotates in front of an off-the-shelf color camera, which causes the displays of observed devices to periodically blink in the camera feed. the periodic blinking results from the physical characteristics of current displays, which shine polarized light either through an lc overlay to produce images or through a polarizer to reduce light reflections on oled displays. polartrack runs a simple detection algorithm on the camera feed to segment displays and track their locations and orientations, which makes polartrack particularly suitable as a tracking system for cross-device interaction with mobile devices. our evaluation of polartrack's tracking quality and comparison with state-of-the-art camera-based multi-device tracking showed a better tracking accuracy and precision with similar tracking reliability. polartrack works as standalone multi-device tracking but is also compatible with existing camera-based tracking systems and can complement them to compensate for their limitations. we have presented polartrack, a novel camera-based approach to detect and track mobile devices inside the capture volume by exploiting display polarization. we described the physical characteristic of current display technologies that result in blinking displays in a camera feed when a linear polarization filter rotates in front of a color camera. polartrack exploits this characteristic and uses a computationally inexpensive algorithm to segment displays from the background using differential images and a naïve weighted sliding window approach. we show how open source multi-device tracking pipelines can use the resulting binary images for device detection and multi-device tracking. we evaluated polartrack’s tracking quality, showing higher accuracy compared to a stateof-the-art open source system. lastly, and to make polartrack reproducible, we provide a low-cost approach to building a polartrack system around a kinect v2 camera from off-the-shelf components.",494
Revisiting “Hole in the Wall” Computing: Private Smart Speakers and Public Slum Settings,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657209,"millions of homes worldwide enjoy access to digital content and services through smart speakers such as amazon's echo and google's home. promotional materials and users' own videos typically show homes that have many well-resourced rooms, with good power and data infrastructures. over the last several years, we have been working with slum communities in india, whose dwellings are usually very compact (one or two rooms), personal home wifi is almost unheard of, power infrastructures are far less robust, and financial resources put such smart speakers out of individual household reach. inspired by the ""hole in the wall"" internet-kiosk programme, we carried out workshops with slum inhabitants to uncover issues and opportunities for providing a smart-speaker-type device in public areas and passageways. we designed and deployed a simple probe that allowed passers-by to ask and receive answers to questions. in this paper, we present the findings of this work, and a design space for such devices in these settings. smart speaker appliances are fast becoming commonplace in homes worldwide. among the many advantages of speech, its text-free nature potentially makes it especially useful for the lower-literate, such as the many so-called emergent users living in resource-constrained areas of the world. the often challenging nature of these environments, however, means that standard, in-home smart speakers—devices that require constant power and a reliable, high-bandwidth internet connection—are typically beyond reach for emergent users. the hole-in-the-wall computing concept has long been seen as a highly valuable resource for the demonstration, learning and awareness of screen-based technologies in emergent user communities. as a first step to identify whether this type of installation would be beneficial for speech-based technology, we conducted a wizard-of-oz investigation in two slum areas of mumbai. we have described the promising results of this probe, and related our findings to the highly-regarded hole-inthe-wall literature. we have demonstrated the opportunities and values of conversational systems—imagined in the western world for single family use in a domestic home—for public slum settings. of course, we are not claiming the impact or longer-term insights of the hole-in-the-wall project. rather, we argue that a key take-away from our work is that it is clearly worth investing the resources to create a deployable conversational speech system for the sorts of unsupervised learning and interaction benefits seen in that project. our work provides evidence, then, that building publicly accessible conversational systems could lead to people experimenting with speech in a way that will not just be beneficial for any public “voice displays,” but also in promoting awareness and community learning about this new modality that individuals might then use on their own device as this becomes viable.",495
"Values, Identity, and Social Translucence: Neurodiverse Student Teams in Higher Education",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657200,"to successfully function within a team, students must develop a range of skills for communication, organization, and conflict resolution. for students on the autism spectrum, these skills mirror the social, communicative, and cognitive experiences that can often be challenging for these learners. since instructors and students collaborate using a mix of technology, we investigated the technology needs of neurodiverse teams comprised of autistic and non-autistic students. we interviewed seven autistic students and five employees of disability services in higher education. our analysis focused on technology stakeholder values, stages of small-group development, and social translucence -- a model for online collaboration highlighting principles of visibility, awareness, and accountability. despite motivation to succeed, neurodiverse students have difficulty expressing individual differences and addressing team conflict. to support future design of technology for neurodiverse teams, we propose: (1) a design space and design concepts including collaborative and affective computing tools, and (2) extending social translucence to account for student and group identities. our research motivates the need for hci researchers and designers to support development of more inclusive sociotechnical environments for teamwork. throughout the team stages, successful team projects leverage team member strengths to form a cohesive team. autistic students described ways that technology can act as a mediator to provide them support and structure in navigating the challenging environment of higher education. there is a need to protect privacy of these individuals, while supporting equity within the team. by incorporating the notion of identity into the design of socially translucent systems, technologies can give people control over disclosure and mechanisms to advocate for their needs in accessible, respectful, and discrete ways. our tailored design space for teamwork can be used to explore more socially translucent ideas by considering stakeholder values as they are negotiated across team stages. future research should prototype and evaluate team-based technologies for neurodiverse teams to refine our design space and design concepts. this advancement can help mediate interactions among teammates, peers, and instructors, and ultimately, support neurodiverse adults as they pursue their goals in higher education.",496
T-Cal: Understanding Team Conversational Data with Calendar-based Visualization,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657201,"understanding team communication and collaboration patterns is critical for improving work efficiency in organizations. this paper presents an interactive visualization system, t-cal, that supports the analysis of conversation data from modern team messaging platforms (e.g., slack). t-cal employs a user-familiar visual interface, a calendar, to enable seamless multi-scale browsing of data from different perspectives. t-cal also incorporates a number of analytical techniques for disentangling interleaving conversations, extracting keywords, and estimating sentiment. the design of t-cal is based on an iterative user-centered design process including interview studies, requirements gathering, initial prototypes demonstration, and evaluation with domain users. the resulting two case studies indicate the effectiveness and usefulness of t-cal in real-world applications, including daily conversations within an industry research lab and student group chats in a mooc. we have presented t-cal, an interactive visualization for assisting the analysis of team communication and collaboration. t-cal displays the conversation data captured in team messaging platforms in multiple scales with a calendar-based visualization. we have also introduced threadpulse for showing conversational threads in multiple levels of detail. by involving expert users, we derived a set of design requirements and iteratively refined the system in a three-stage design process. for evaluation, we reported two case studies to illustrate the effectiveness and usefulness of t-cal with realistic datasets in two different applications. in the future, we plan to pursue the comparative analysis of conversation data from two teams. moreover, we want to focus on the event-based analysis in data, e.g., understanding when a problem was proposed, how it evolved, and when it was solved, by integrating other sources of data. finally, we plan to further evaluate t-cal in different application domains and conduct a long-term deployment study.",497
HapCube: A Wearable Tactile Device to Provide Tangential and Normal Pseudo-Force Feedback on a Fingertip,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657202,"haptic devices allow a more immersive experience with virtual and augmented reality. however, for a wider range of usage they need to be miniaturized while maintaining the quality of haptic feedback. in this study, we used two kinds of human sensory illusion of vibration. the first illusion involves creating a virtual force (pulling sensation) using asymmetric vibration, and the second involves imparting compliances of complex stress-strain curves (i.e. force-displacement curves of mechanical keyboards) to a rigid object by changing the frequency and amplitude of vibration. using these two illusions, we developed a wearable tactile device named hapcube, consisting of three orthogonal voicecoil actuators. four measurement tests and four user tests confirmed that 1) a combination of two orthogonal asymmetric vibrations could provide a 2d virtual force in any tangential directions on a finger pad, and 2) a single voicecoil actuator produced pseudo-force feedback of the complex compliance curves in the normal direction. in this study, we showed that two asymmetric vibrations can be synthesized to generate two dimensional virtual forces in a plane. we also demonstrated that it is possible to provide distinctive normal feedback based on compliance curves with a small-sized voicecoil actuator. we hope that the knowledge will be a cornerstone for designing useful haptic device with vibration and human sensory illusion.",498
Keppi: A Tangible User Interface for Self-Reporting Pain,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657203,"motivated by the need to support those managing chronic pain, we report on the iterative design, development, and evaluation of keppi, a novel pressure-based tangible user interface (tui) for the self-report of pain intensity. in-lab studies with 28 participants found individuals were able to use keppi to reliably report low, medium, and high pain as well as map squeeze pressure to pain level. based on insights from these evaluations, we ultimately created a wearable version of keppi with multiple form factors, including a necklace, bracelet, and keychain. interviews indicated high receptivity to the wearable design, which satisfied additional user-identified needs (e.g., discreet and convenient) and highlighted key directions for the continued refinement of tangible devices for pain assessment. this paper reports on the development of keppi, a novel pressure-based user input device for self-reporting scalar values — in this case, of pain intensity. constructing three versions of keppi to meet a variety of identified design considerations, hardware constraints, and user preferences, we illustrated the feasibility, reliability, and usability of our approach to support the momentary self-assessment of pain levels through an unobtrusive and natural tangible interaction. in doing so, we additionally identified a range of factors (e.g., from a user’s hand strength and pain type to general aesthetic and ergonomic issues) that can help guide others working in this space or on similar problems. overall, our findings provide a number of implications for the continued development and evaluation of such self-assessment tools.",499
"Data, Data Everywhere, and Still Too Hard to Link: Insights from User Interactions with Diabetes Apps",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657204,"for those with chronic conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, smartphone apps offer the promise of an affordable, convenient, and personalized disease management tool. however, despite significant academic research and commercial development in this area, diabetes apps still show low adoption rates and underwhelming clinical outcomes. through user-interaction sessions with 16 people with type 1 diabetes, we provide evidence that commonly used interfaces for diabetes self-management apps, while providing certain benefits, can fail to explicitly address the cognitive and emotional requirements of users. from analysis of these sessions with eight such user interface designs, we report on user requirements, as well as interface benefits, limitations, and then discuss the implications of these findings. finally, with the goal of improving these apps, we identify 3 questions for designers, and review for each in turn: current shortcomings, relevant approaches, exposed challenges, and potential solutions. sessions with 16 users interacting with representative ui designs for diabetes self-help apps have been analyzed to see how well they meet users’ needs. we have drawn attention to two principal areas of failure: excessive cognitive demands on users to extract value; and the need for emotional sensitivity given the affective potential of these interactions. cognitively, these apps require too much effort to make sense of data and locate meaningful insights, exposing users to visual confusion and cognitive overload. emotionally, the complex relationship users have with their data appears inadequately considered. we have also proposed 3 questions for designers to advance these tools so that they can serve a more meaningful role in people’s lives. if the purpose of such apps is variously: to provide a digital tool for periodic troubleshooting of specific problems; recording diverse data for interaction with a health care provider; and to give the patient broad overviews of collected data; then one may consider these apps tolerably successful. our participants were generally comfortable browsing through and understanding the significance of individual data entries, and in most instances, given a little time for close examination, could understand data within graphs and charts. yet, as this study has illustrated, users’ day-to-day needs appear somewhat different. we have presented evidence from the literature that the majority of diabetes care is self-care, and that patients should be enabled to independently make frequent well-informed care decisions. based on these premises, the current study gives evidence that current diabetes apps are inadequate for such goals. given the number of apps based on a narrow range of interaction and ui paradigms, one must ask why so many app developers continue to deliver apps that fail to adequately address users’ problems, require significant daily effort to assemble representative data, show debatable improvements in outcomes, and have low adoption rates. while the desire to avoid medical regulation is a factor, perhaps it is also because they adhere to a model that is too closely tied to clinical requirements and conventions that focus on a mediated session, and thereby are ill suited to actual user requirements and expectations. we posit that this is not just a matter of adding new ways for patients to record more data, automation of data entry alone, more attractive color schemes, or even more visually appealing designs and interactions. rather there is a need to reconsider how to help users draw value from real and often noisy diabetes data. furthermore, there must be realistic assessment of available cognitive expenditure and emotional resilience given the contexts and frequency of usage. in summary, despite some tangible benefits from these uis, we appear to have a widespread and repeated failure to understand user requirements combined with a lack of willingness to challenge established conventions. we suggest that the three posed questions should be answered so that we can move towards more effective and sensitive systems for health management.",500
Rewire: Interface Design Assistance from Examples,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657215,"interface designers often use screenshot images of example designs as building blocks for new designs. since images are unstructured and hard to edit, designers typically reconstruct screenshots with vector graphics tools in order to reuse or edit parts of the design. unfortunately, this reconstruction process is tedious and slow. we present rewire, an interactive system that helps designers leverage example screenshots. rewire automatically infers a vector representation of screenshots where each ui component is a separate object with editable shape and style properties. based on this representation, the system provides three design assistance modes that help designers reuse or redraw components of the example design. the results from our quantitative and user evaluations demonstrate that rewire can generate accurate vector representations of interface screenshots found in the wild and that design assistance enables users to reconstruct and edit example designs more efficiently compared to a baseline design tool. in this paper, we presented rewire, a system that automatically infers a semantic vector-based representation of interface shapes from a pixel-based input screenshot. rewire provides new forms of design assistance to ease the adaptation of example screenshots directly in designs. if designers can save time from recreating interface elements, they would potentially have more time to consider alternative designs, which would lead them to better final products [11]. we believe that systems like rewire can enable us to explore new forms of intelligent design assistance enabling new possibilities in user interface design.",501
Uncertainty Visualization Influences how Humans Aggregate Discrepant Information,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657216,"the number of sensors in our surroundings that provide the same information steadily increases. since sensing is prone to errors, sensors may disagree. for example, a gps-based tracker on the phone and a sensor on the bike wheel may provide discrepant estimates on traveled distance. this poses a user dilemma, namely how to reconcile the conflicting information into one estimate. we investigated whether visualizing the uncertainty associated with sensor measurements improves the quality of users' inference. we tested four visualizations with increasingly detailed representation of uncertainty. our study repeatedly presented two sensor measurements with varying degrees of inconsistency to participants who indicated their best guess of the ""true"" value. we found that uncertainty information improves users' estimates, especially if sensors differ largely in their associated variability. improvements were larger for information-rich visualizations. based on our findings, we provide an interactive tool to select the optimal visualization for displaying conflicting information. in this paper, we conducted a study to understand how uncertainty visualizations influence humans’ choice of internal models of information aggregation. we showed that presenting uncertainty information improves users’ inference when the inconsistency between two measurements increases and when the measurements’ associated reliabilities are dissimilar. we recommend to use a point estimate visualization only for measurements with little inconsistency or non-diverging reliabilities. the higher the inconsistency or difference in reliability, the more humans benefit from uncertainty information. based on the interpretation of our results, we recommend to use a dot plot to communicate uncertainty information for conflicting information. to better illustrate our results and make them easily explorable for designers and other researchers, we implemented and contribute an interactive tool that allows to visualize conflicting information. in addition to the visualizations, it shows the optimal combined value and a prediction of what users might actually choose as the combined value. we hope that our research will inspire research in other application areas of hci to understand whether the results are applicable to communicating uncertain data in other contexts than sensor measurements. as we choose sensor measurements as a general scenario, we are confident that the results are applicable in other areas. in future work, we hope to extend the interactive tool to support more different types of visualizations. further, we are interested in understanding how the difference between systematic and random error and larger inconsistencies than tested in this experiment influence humans’ inference.",502

Strategies for Engaging Communities in Creating Physical Civic Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657218,"despite widespread interest in civic technologies, empowering neighbourhoods to take advantage of these technologies in their local area remains challenging. this paper presents findings from the ardler inventors project, which aimed to understand how neighbourhoods can be supported in performing roles normally carried out by researchers and designers. we describe the end-to-end process of bringing people together around technology, designing and prototyping ideas, and ultimately testing several devices in their local area. through this work, we explore different strategies for infrastructuring local residents' participation with technology, including the use of hackathon-like intensive design events and pre-designed kits for assembly. we contribute findings relating to the ability of these strategies to support building communities around civic technology and the challenges that must be addressed. providing neighbourhoods with the means to best take advantage of new technologies in their local area is a difficult challenge. through this research, we have prototyped a series of strategies for engaging neighbourhood residents in different stages of a design process: from gathering insights and prototyping ideas, through to fabricating refined prototypes and conducting deployments to gain feedback. each of these approaches has shown promise in building the relationships, skills and enthusiasm needed to support future creativity in the neighbourhood. however, we also saw that some of our assumptions about the role of technology and creativity in neighbourhoods were misconceived. further work must continue to explore how neighbourhoods can better take ownership not just of the technology, but of the processes that develop them.",504
Neuromechanics of a Button Press,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657219,"to press a button, a finger must push down and pull up with the right force and timing. how the motor system succeeds in button-pressing, in spite of neural noise and lacking direct access to the mechanism of the button, is poorly understood. this paper investigates a unifying account based on neuromechanics. mechanics is used to model muscles controlling the finger that contacts the button. neurocognitive principles are used to model how the motor system learns appropriate muscle activations over repeated strokes though relying on degraded sensory feedback. neuromechanical simulations yield a rich set of predictions for kinematics, dynamics, and user performance and may aid in understanding and improving input devices. we present a computational implementation and evaluate predictions for common button types. neuromechanics views button-pressing as optimal control limited by physical, neural, and sensory bounds. in our study, we defined the motor control problem, proposed theoretical ideas on how the motor system solves them, implemented them computationally, and inspected predictions against empirical data. we sum up the findings thus: the model can – even with minimal fitting of parameters to data – predict some core characteristics of fd and dv patterns, as well as the use of force and the temporal precision for four distinct button types. the model fared less well in two respects: first, in failing to predict the ranges of kinematics variables for some buttons and, second, in failing to predict varied button-pressing strategies. although much work remains to be done, the results are promising and support the optimality assumption. we conclude that neuromechanics deserves more attention as a rigorous and biologically motivated theory for the study of input methods.",505
Is it Happy?: Behavioural and Narrative Frame Complexity Impact Perceptions of a Simple Furry Robot's Emotions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657210,"critical to social human-robot interaction is a robot's emotional richness, expressed within the parameters of its physical display. while emotion arousal is straightforward to convey, human valence (positivity) evaluations are famously ambiguous, whether we are assessing other humans or a robot. imagine someone breathing raggedly: are they nervous, or excited? to assess the premise that irregular breathing connotes low valence (emotion negativity), we implemented different levels of breathing variability and complexity in simple furry robots. we asked 10 participants to watch and feel the behaviors, rate their valence, and explain their impressions. while a quantitative exploration of new and previous data showed correlation between multi-scale entropy and valence, the rich narratives revealed by thematic analysis of participant explanations call into question whether a single motion can, alone, be unambiguously valenced. based on this evidence that people perceive robots as having inner lives, we recommend ways to build up narrative contexts over multiple interactions. we present further evidence that even a very simple robot can be capable of evocative emotion display and interaction. we presented evidence that the valence of a breathing-like behaviour can be determined through complexity measures such as mse for valence. however, we have also presented evidence that simple dimensional measures for determining an emotion state do not capture the diversity and depth of people’s subjective experience in this kind of interaction. valence seems especially vulnerable to differences in narrative frame. as such, we advocate emotion behaviour authoring considers narrative framing to help affective grounding [24].",506
Designing a Reclamation of Body and Health: Cancer Survivor Tattoos as Coping Ritual,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657211,"historically, tattoos have been perceived as a mark of deviant behavior from the perspective of western medicine. however, cancer survivor tattoos are one of many strategies used to recover from the trauma of cancer diagnosis and treatment. in this study, we seek to understand the significance of these tattoos in the context of survivorship. we interviewed 19 cancer survivors about their survivor tattoos, exploring the benefits of designing, discussing, and displaying these tattoos as elements of emotional recovery post-cancer. we found that the act of designing a survivor tattoo facilitated all three elements of post-traumatic growth processes, including: (1) changed self-perception; (2) changed sense of relationships with others; and (3) changed philosophy of life. through participants' lived experiences, we discuss information about emotions, health, and recovery encoded in tattoos, and provide implications for tools to help future cancer survivors recover from the trauma of diagnosis and treatment. there are as many ways to cope with cancer as there are cancer survivors. the range of behaviors related to cancer survivor tattoos is similarly varied. survivor tattoos can be very private—a secret totem for the survivor to keep up their spirits or for a sense of protection. but survivor tattoos can also be a public signal, shared both offline and online in social situations, giving the survivor a chance to tell their story or advocate for cancer awareness. by interviewing survivors with tattoos, we were able to identify all three elements of post-traumatic growth, which were fostered and facilitated by the acts of designing, discussing, and displaying cancer survivor tattoos. in this study, we discuss three opportunities for hci and health designers and researchers to enhance the benefits of post-trauma growth mechanisms supported by the “work” involved with survivor tattoos. first, by incorporating tattoos into the clinical record, designers can help legitimate the information encoded in survivor tattoos that convey aspects of changed self-perception after trauma. second, digital tools to encourage trauma survivors to collaboratively design visual expressions of feelings and memories can facilitate the necessary changed sense of relationships with others, which is essential to post-traumatic growth. finally, researchers should embrace creative means of engaging with artifacts designed by research participants, which can be used to elicit changed philosophy of life after trauma. these three design implications give hci and health designers and researchers greater sensitivity in working with survivors of trauma, while enhancing trauma survivors’ engagement with essential elements on post-traumatic growth.",507
Mismatch of Expectations: How Modern Learning Resources Fail Conversational Programmers,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657212,"conversational programmers represent a class of learners who are not required to write any code, yet try to learn programming to improve their participation in technical conversations. we carried out interviews with 23 conversational programmers to better understand the challenges they face in technical conversations, what resources they choose to learn programming, how they perceive the learning process, and to what extent learning programming actually helps them. among our key findings, we found that conversational programmers often did not know where to even begin the learning process and ended up using formal and informal learning resources that focus largely on programming syntax and logic. however, since the end goal of conversational programmers was not to build artifacts, modern learning resources usually failed these learners in their pursuits of improving their technical conversations. our findings point to design opportunities in hci to invent learner-centered approaches that address the needs of conversational programmers and help them establish common ground in technical conversations. in conclusion, we have contributed insights from conversational programmers across a wide range of job roles who experience challenges and try to learn programming to improve their conversations. in particular, we have described their learning approaches and struggles and highlighted six reasons why modern resources designed for traditional learners, such as cs students and professional programmers, are not appropriate for this learner population. we have also highlighted ways in which hci can play a pivotal role in designing learning resources and interactions that are suitable not only for conversational programmers but also other members of society who are increasingly wanting to develop programming and technical literacy.",508
An Experience Sampling Study of User Reactions to Browser Warnings in the Field,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657213,"web browser warnings should help protect people from malware, phishing, and network attacks. adhering to warnings keeps people safer online. recent improvements in warning design have raised adherence rates, but they could still be higher. and prior work suggests many people still do not understand them. thus, two challenges remain: increasing both comprehension and adherence rates. to dig deeper into user decision making and comprehension of warnings, we performed an experience sampling study of web browser security warnings, which involved surveying over 6,000 chrome and firefox users in situ to gather reasons for adhering or not to real warnings. we find these reasons are many and vary with context. contrary to older prior work, we do not find a single dominant failure in modern warning design---like habituation---that prevents effective decisions. we conclude that further improvements to warnings will require solving a range of smaller contextual misunderstandings. we performed a large-scale study of web browser warning behavior using the experience sampling method (esm). in so doing, we observed that when encountering warning messages in situ, participants have a wide variety of reasons for choosing to adhere to or proceed past a given warning. based on our qualitative data, we conclude that warnings have improved to the point that additional gains in adherence rates are likely only to be made by examining contextual factors and a wider variety of users’ concerns, rather than through one-size-fits-all improvements. similarly, given that users make inconsistent decisions regarding whether to proceed or adhere to a warning, our results suggest that habituation plays a smaller role in user decision making than previously thought.",509
Extracting Design Guidelines for Wearables and Movement in Tabletop Role-Playing Games via a Research Through Design Process,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657214,"we believe that wearables and movement are perfect fit for enhancing tabletop role-playing (ttrpg) experience, since they can provide embodied interaction, are perceived as character-costumes, enhance ludic properties and increase the connectedness to the imaginary game worlds. by providing these improvements, they can increase the immersiveness and player/character relationship which are critical for an ideal ttrpg experience. to investigate this underexplored area, we conducted an extensive research through design process which includes a (1) participatory design workshop with 25 participants, (2) preliminary user tests with wizard-of-oz and experience prototypes with 15 participants, (3) production of a new game system, wearable and tangible artifacts and (4) summative user tests for understanding the effects on experience with 16 participants. as a result of our study, we extracted design guidelines about how to integrate wearables and movement in narrative-based tabletop games and communicate how the results of each phase affected our artifacts. with this project, we propose the first example of the articulation of a research through design process for designing wearables and movement-based gameplay for ttrpg. for doing so, we undertook an extensive research design process involving 53 participants in the process and communicate the methods and the outcomes of our study in different phases. we also explained how these outcomes affected our design decisions while designing the wearpg game system and our artifacts which are the elemental gauntlets and the luck stone. as a result of our study, players indicated that the wearables and movementbased gameplay increased their player/character relationship and immersion experiences. therefore, we believe that researchers can replicate our design process to introduce new game systems or peripheral devices to computer augmented games and to other narrative-based games which require long term engagement. other than that, as a result of our research process, we produced generalizable design guidelines that can be incorporated in the game design process. these guidelines can help designers in integrating new modalities to games, designing peripheral devices which will be used as supportive controllers and designing game mechanics for computer-augmented analog games.",510
Exploring the Design of Tailored Virtual Reality Experiences for People with Dementia,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657225,"despite indications that recreational virtual reality (vr) experiences could be beneficial for people with dementia, this area remains unexplored in contrast to the body of work on neurological rehabilitation through vr in dementia. with recreational vr applications coming to the market for dementia, we must consider how vr experiences for people with dementia can be sensitively designed to provide comfortable and enriching experiences. working with seven participants from a local dementia care charity, we outline some of the opportunities and challenges inherent to the design and use of vr experiences with people with dementia and their carers through an inductive thematic analysis. we also provide a series of future directions for work in vr and dementia: 1) careful physical design, 2) making room for sharing, 3) utilizing all senses, 4) personalization, and 5) ensuring the active inclusion of the person with dementia. this paper has presented a study with 7 participants focusing on the design of novel virtual reality environments for people with dementia and their carers. through iterative design workshops, including an extended engagement with a couple living with dementia, we discuss the design of three different vr environments. our thematic analysis of textual data from these workshops has produced three themes: feeling foolish and feeling free, seeking to share new worlds, and blending the old with the new. we close with a discussion of five indications for future design in the area: 1) physical design of systems, 2) making room for sharing, 3) utilizing all senses, 4) personalization, and 5) positioning the person with dementia as an active participant. finally, we call for design to occupy a new space in technologies for dementia – one which is not occupied by the past or focused on perceived cognitive deficits, but oriented towards the present and ready to make use of a full spectrum of interactivity.",511
Project Zanzibar: A Portable and Flexible Tangible Interaction Platform,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657226,"we present project zanzibar: a flexible mat that can locate, uniquely identify and communicate with tangible objects placed on its surface, as well as sense a user's touch and hover hand gestures. we describe the underlying technical contributions: efficient and localised near field communication (nfc) over a large surface area; object tracking combining nfc signal strength and capacitive footprint detection, and manufacturing techniques for a rollable device form-factor that enables portability, while providing a sizable interaction area when unrolled. in addition, we detail design patterns for tangibles of varying complexity and interactive capabilities, including the ability to sense orientation on the mat, harvest power, provide additional input and output, stack, or extend sensing outside the bounds of the mat. capabilities and interaction modalities are illustrated with self-generated applications. finally, we report on the experience of professional game developers building novel physical/digital experiences using the platform. we presented zanzibar, a platform for tangible interaction. the zanzibar mat combines capacitive sensing and nfc communication in a novel way, which allows multitouch and hover gesture input to coexist with physical object manipulation and control. the hardware design of the mat addresses the challenge of providing nfc coverage over a large area, in a scalable and efficient manner. our tracking system fuses capacitive sensing data and nfc to provide robust tracking of objects. we documented our fabrication techniques to make the mat rollable: a form-factor that makes the device portable, while providing a surface area large enough to support interaction with multiple tangible objects. our implementation builds on the existing nfc ecosystem and extends it with custom nfc tag designs that can be used to build tangible objects of varying complexity and interactive capabilities. one characteristic of a useful platform is its ability to support varied and compelling applications. to this end, we have developed a set of scenarios that showcase different capabilities of the platform, illustrating the various interaction modalities it can support and highlighting how zanzibar can be used together with existing computing devices (including augmented reality displays) to create a range of distinct physical/digital experiences. our application examples have focused on play and education, two areas that we are passionate about and where the benefits of tangible interaction are well accepted. we have further validated our platform by deploying it with professional game developers, and learnt from their experience creating physical/digital game hybrids. we hope that our work motivates and enables others to continue to explore new ways to play, learn, and interact.",512
The RAD: Making Racing Games Equivalently Accessible to People Who Are Blind,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657227,"we introduce the racing auditory display (rad), an audio-based user interface that allows players who are blind to play the same types of racing games that sighted players can play with an efficiency and sense of control that are similar to what sighted players have. the rad works with a standard pair of headphones and comprises two novel sonification techniques: the sound slider for understanding a car's speed and trajectory on a racetrack and the turn indicator system for alerting players of the direction, sharpness, length, and timing of upcoming turns. in a user study with 15 participants (3 blind; the rest blindfolded and analyzed separately), we found that players preferred the rad's interface over that of mach 1, a popular blind-accessible racing game. we also found that the rad allows an avid gamer who is blind to race as well on a complex racetrack as casual sighted players can, without a significant difference between lap times or driving paths. this paper offers a vision of how video games can go beyond just being blind-accessible to being equivalently accessible to people who are blind, allowing them to play with a similar sense of control (intention) and efficiency as sighted players can. to this end, we introduce the racing auditory display (rad) to help racing games become equivalently accessible to people who are blind. it comprises two novel sonification techniques: the sound slider for understanding a car’s speed and trajectory on a racetrack and the turn indicator system for alerting players of the direction, sharpness, length, and timing of upcoming turns. through a pair of empirical studies, we found that players preferred the rad’s interface over that of mach 1, a popular blind-accessible racing game, and at times “felt like [they] had as much information as if [they] could see the track” (p1). we demonstrated that the rad makes it possible for a gamer who is blind to race comparably to casual players using sight. still, there are several limitations to our studies and to the rad. first, our study included just four self-described gamers and three people who are blind, so our results cannot be assumed to apply to everyone from these groups. a more thorough followup study targeting gamers who are blind would be needed for this. second, the rad relies on 3d sound spatialization. not everyone can hear spatialized sounds correctly with off-theshelf head-related transfer functions (hrtfs). future games could allow players to load an hrtf from a profile so they can hear spatialized sound clearly in many different games. last, the rad is not as effective with non-gamers and does not teach them “video game literacy” such as how video game vehicle handling works, nor is it effective at helping players recover from crashes or from driving off the track. a future version of the rad could include a mach 1-style probing feature for helping players learn the game mechanics and recover from crashes. we also think it would be feasible to extend the rad to incorporate other racing game elements such as opponent vehicles, boosts, item pickups, and shortcuts. we hope that just as user interface toolkits provide tools such as scrollbars, sliders, menus, and radio buttons that “just work” when software is published, game engines will one day include building blocks such as walls and track pieces that will “just work” with user interfaces such as the rad or audiogps [17] when games are published to make all games blind-friendly.",513
Inclusive Computing in Special Needs Classrooms: Designing for All,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657228,"with a growing call for an increased emphasis on computing in school curricula, there is a need to make computing accessible to a diversity of learners. one potential approach is to extend the use of physical toolkits, which have been found to encourage collaboration, sustained engagement and effective learning in classrooms in general. however, little is known as to whether and how these benefits can be leveraged in special needs schools, where learners have a spectrum of distinct cognitive and social needs. here, we investigate how introducing a physical toolkit can support learning about computing concepts for special education needs (sen) students in their classroom. by tracing how the students' interactions-both with the physical toolkit and with each other-unfolded over time, we demonstrate how the design of both the form factor and the learning tasks embedded in a physical toolkit contribute to collaboration, comprehension and engagement when learning in mixed sen classrooms. there can be many challenges for supporting learning in sen classrooms, especially for abstract topics like computing. students often have a wider mix of abilities than their peers in mainstream school settings, and it can be difficult to structure learning tasks that simultaneously provide engaging and effective learning experiences for all. however, as our study has shown, the affordances of physical interfaces have much promise in sen classrooms, especially when the design of the task type and supporting materials enable self-regulated, embodied learning with appropriate support from the instructors. if tasks are designed in this way, physical interfaces can enable students with a range of difficulties to leverage their abilities to collaborate and engage with curricular content, while fostering comprehension, enjoyment and a sense of self-accomplishment. there is much scope for designing new technologies to support more inclusive computing.",514
Caption Crawler: Enabling Reusable Alternative Text Descriptions using Reverse Image Search,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657229,"accessing images online is often difficult for users with vision impairments. this population relies on text descriptions of images that vary based on website authors' accessibility practices. where one author might provide a descriptive caption for an image, another might provide no caption for the same image, leading to inconsistent experiences. in this work, we present the caption crawler system, which uses reverse image search to find existing captions on the web and make them accessible to a user's screen reader. we report our system's performance on a set of 481 websites from alexa.com's list of most popular sites to estimate caption coverage and latency, and also report blind and sighted users' ratings of our system's output quality. finally, we conducted a user study with fourteen screen reader users to examine how the system might be used for personal browsing. in this work, we presented the caption crawler system, a real-time system for image captioning that relies on reverse image search to reuse pre-existing captions for the target image from other websites. we performed an automated crawl using the system over 481 web pages selected from alexa.com’s list of the most popular websites in order to obtain an idea of the caption coverage on common sites and characterize the performance of our system; we were able to provide alt text for about 12% of images that lacked it, with only 18 seconds’ latency on average. we also presented a study of caption preferences that found both sighted and blind users preferred hearing the longest available caption by default, and a lab study with fourteen blind users to further evaluate our system’s performance. our findings indicate that users are receptive to the idea of quickly and automatically replacing missing and low-quality alt texts with pre-existing captions from elsewhere on the web, that pre-existing human-authored captions are preferred to current automated vision-to-language approaches, and that providing a queue of alternative possibilities was valued by end users as a way for them to learn more about an image and have increased confidence in caption accuracy. these performance and user-study findings suggest that our approach can play an important role in helping to address the issue of missing and poor-quality alt text online.",515
How Far Is Up?: Bringing the Counterpointed Triad Technique to Digital Storybook Apps,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657220,"interactive storybooks, such as those available on the ipad, offer multiple ways to convey a story, mostly through visual, textual and audio content. how to effectively deliver this combination of content so that it supports positive social and educational development in pre-literate children is relatively underexplored. in order to address this issue we introduce the ""counterpointed triad technique"". drawing from traditional literary theory we design visual, textual and audio content that each conveys different aspects of a story. we explore the use of this technique through a storybook we designed ourselves called ""how far is up?"". a study involving 26 kindergarten children shows that ""how far is up?"" can engage pre-literature children while they are reading alone and also when they are reading with an adult. based on our craft knowledge and study findings, we present a set of design strategies that aim to provide designers with practical guidance on how to create engaging interactive digital storybooks. interactive storybooks, such as those designed for the ipad, are continually popular with young children. these storybooks offer multiple ways to convey a story, however, there is the need for further research into how to design for both independent and shared reading of story apps. we introduced the counterpointed triad technique. derived from traditional literary theory we extended it to digital storybook design. in doing this we emphasize that visual, textual and audio content can each convey different aspects of a story. we present this as one possible approach that may be adopted by designers in order to support individual and shared reading of story apps. we explore the use of this technique through the design of how far is up?. a study involving 26 kindergarten children suggests that how far is up? can engage them alone and when reading with an adult. based on our craft knowledge and study findings, we propose five design strategies that aim to provide designers with practical guidance on how to create engaging interactive storybooks. our research provides designers with a technique that results in counterpointed app content. it operates as an alternative to current symmetrical design content that features redundancy within its content. although our approach focuses on the design of apps that feature a story, we believe it may also be applicable to other interactive experiences that use other hardware, such as augmented reality where virtual and real-world story content could be counterpointed and other content forms, such as games, where interactive features direct players to counterpointed content. our work represents a beginning towards a more comprehensive understanding of counterpointed design in order to support both independent and shared sessions, so that ultimately, more and more children as well as adults can profit from the benefits of engaging in both experiences.",516
Understanding the Accessibility of Smartphone Photography for People with Motor Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657221,"we present the results of an exploration to understand the accessibility of smartphone photography for people with motor impairments. we surveyed forty-six people and interviewed twelve people about capturing, editing, and sharing photographs on smartphones. we found that people with motor impairments encounter many challenges with smartphone photography, resulting in users capturing fewer photographs than they would like. participants described various strategies they used to overcome challenges in order to capture a quality photograph. we also found that photograph quality plays a large role in deciding which photographs users share and how often they share, with most participants rating their photographs as average or poor quality compared to photos shared on their social networks. additionally, we created design probes of two novel photography interfaces and received feedback from our interview participants about their usefulness and functionality. based on our findings, we propose design recommendations for how to improve the accessibility of mobile photoware for people with motor impairments. we have presented results of our exploration into understanding the accessibility of smartphone photography for people with motor impairments. we found that people with motor impairments experience many challenges during the photo capture process. as a result, they capture photos less often than they would like due to the time and physical effort required to capture a good photo. we also found that they share fewer photos than they would like because of perceived deficiencies in their photos. we introduced two accessible photography concepts, pair photography and infrastructure camera control, and received feedback from participants about their functionality and usefulness. finally, we presented design recommendations for how to improve the accessibility of smartphone photography for people with motor impairments. our research shows that people with motor impairments do engage in smartphone photography, but the inaccessibility of mobile photoware deters users from enjoying the personal and social benefits smartphone photography offers. we end with a quote from p9 about the importance of smartphone photography in his life: “the photographs are for social media. social media is for expanding your social network, which is something that people with a disability typically struggle with, the size or sphere of their social network, either because they don’t have mobility, they can’t get places or because the activities that they are doing just aren’t as widely varied as everybody else. i like to think about it more than just the accessibility of cameras.”",517
Ohmic-Touch: Extending Touch Interaction by Indirect Touch through Resistive Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657222,"when an object is interposed between a touch surface and a finger/touch pen, the change in impedance caused by the object can be measured by the driver software. this phenomenon has been used to develop new interaction techniques. unlike previous works that focused on the capacitance component in impedance, ohmic-touch enhances touch input modality by sensing resistance. using 3d printers or inkjet printers with conductive materials and off-the-shelf electronic components/sensors, resistance is easily and precisely controllable. we implement mechanisms on touch surfaces based on the electrical resistance of the object: for example, to sense the touching position on an interposed object, to identify each object, and to sense light, force, or temperature by using resistors and sensors. additionally, we conduct experimental studies that demonstrate that our technology has a recognition accuracy of the resistance value of 97%. in this paper, we proposed a method called ohmic-touch that extends the modality of touch inputs using the electric resistance on commercial capacitive touch surfaces. ohmictouch provides a series of interactions without requiring the touch object to be powered. as such, the proposed method allows for the use of inexpensive materials. therefore, the proposed can be a practical technique for providing greater modality to inputs on touch surfaces. we believe this paper will contribute to advances in the hci community as a basis for expanding input modalities for capacitive touch surfaces. in a future study, we will implement effective applications that utilize the features of this technique for mobile devices and its efficiency will be evaluated.",518
TeleHuman2: A Cylindrical Light Field Teleconferencing System for Life-size 3D Human Telepresence,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657223,"for telepresence to support the richness of multiparty conversations, it is important to convey motion parallax and stereoscopy without head-worn apparatus. telehuman2 is a ""hologrammatic"" telepresence system that conveys full-body 3d video of interlocutors using a human-sized cylindrical light field display. for rendering, the system uses an array of projectors mounted above the heads of participants in a ring around a retroreflective cylinder. unique angular renditions are calculated from streaming depth video captured at the remote location. projected images are retro-reflected into the eyes of local participants, at 1.3º intervals providing angular renditions simultaneously for left and right eyes of all onlookers, which conveys motion parallax and stereoscopy without head-worn apparatus or head tracking. our technical evaluation of the angular accuracy of the system demonstrates that the error in judging the angle of a remote arrow object represented in telehuman2 is within 1 degree, and not significantly different from similar judgments of a collocated arrow object. we presented telehuman2, a remote telepresence system that conveys full-sized 3d video of remote participants via a cylindrical light field display. for rendering, the system uses a large array of projectors mounted above the heads of participants in a ring around a human-sized horizontally retroreflective cylinder. each projector has its own renderer calculating a viewport from a 3d relief map provided by the video capture system at the remote location. this capture system consists of an array of visible light stereoscopic zed cameras connected to a pc. locally, each projector image is retro-reflected back for each angle into the eyes of local participants, conveying correct continuous motion parallax and stereoscopy to multiple participants without any need for head-worn apparatus or head tracking. our technical evaluation of angular accuracy of the system demonstrates that the error in judging the angle of an arrow object represented in telehuman2 is within 1 degree, and not significantly different from that of the real arrow object.",519
Co-designing Mobile Online Safety Applications with Children,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657224,"parents use mobile monitoring software to observe and restrict their children's activities in order to minimize the risks associated with internet-enabled mobile devices. as children are stakeholders in such technologies, recent research has called for their inclusion in its design process. to investigate children's perceptions of parental mobile monitoring technologies and explore their interaction preferences, we held two co-design sessions with 12 children ages 7-12. children first reviewed and redesigned an existing mobile monitoring application. next, they designed ways children could use monitoring software when they encounter mobile risks (e.g., cyberbullying, inappropriate content). results showed that children acknowledged safety needs and accepted certain parental controls. they preferred and designed controls that emphasized restriction over monitoring, taught risk coping, promoted parent-child communication, and automated interactions. our results benefit designers looking to develop parental mobile monitoring technologies in ways that children will both accept and can actively benefit from. our work envisioned new futures for and presents new perspectives on mobile monitoring technologies by working with children as co-designers. results showed that, while children acknowledged mobile safety needs and accepted certain parental controls, they preferred technologies that emphasized restriction over monitoring, taught risk coping, promoted parent-child communication, and automated interactions. the expanded understanding of children’s desires for mobile monitoring technologies advances the goal of developing flexible tools that fit into family value systems. our results benefit designers looking to develop parental mobile monitoring technologies in ways that children will both accept and can actively benefit from.",520
Intellingo: An Intelligible Translation Environment,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657235,"translation environments offer various translation aids to support professional translators. however, translation aids typically provide only limited justification for the translation suggestions they propose. in this paper we present intellingo, a translation environment that explores intelligibility for translation aids, to enable more sensible usage of translation suggestions. we performed a comparative study between an intelligible version and a non-intelligible version of intellingo. the results show that although adding intelligibility does not necessarily result in significant changes to the user experience, translators can better assess translation suggestions without a negative impact on their performance. intelligibility is preferred by translators when the additional information it conveys benefits the translation process and when this information is not part of the translator's readily available knowledge. in this paper we presented intellingo, an intelligible translation environment for professional translation work that includes various translation aids, such as term bases, translation memory and machine translation. in contrast with traditional translation environments, the user interface of intellingo presents translation aids in a more intelligible manner in order to allow translators to use them in a more efficient way. it provides additional context about the quality and source of the suggestions, as well as subtle explanations why suggestions were made. furthermore, intellingo highlights how translation suggestions are related to the context of the ongoing translation. to investigate the impact of intelligible translation aids on the translation process, a user study was performed with professional translators. participants were positive to very positive in their comments about both the simple version and the intelligible version of intellingo. the results show that intelligibility does help professional translators to assess the quality of the generated suggestions and to understand how these suggestions can be used in translation, without distracting them or negatively impacting their efficiency. surprisingly, the study showed that adding intelligibility in the user interface design did not result in significant changes to the user experience. intelligible design of translation aids does not affect the quality of the translation suggestions themselves. however, the intelligible features inform translators quickly about the quality and context of the suggestions to support better decision making. translators only prefer intelligible translation aids when the additional information they convey benefits the translation process, and when this information is not part of the translators readily available knowledge. usage of intelligibility in design needs to be carefully balanced: providing more information and context might lead to a decrease in efficiency and a potential information overload. we showed various possibilities to add intelligibility to professional translation tools, and explored their impact on the user experience.",521
Thor's Hammer: An Ungrounded Force Feedback Device Utilizing Propeller-Induced Propulsive Force,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657236,"we present a new handheld haptic device, thor's hammer, which uses propeller propulsion to generate ungrounded, 3-dof force feedback. thor's hammer has six motors and propellers that generates strong thrusts of air without the need for physical grounding or heavy air compressors. with its location and orientation tracked by an optimal tracking system, the system can exert forces in arbitrary directions regardless of the device's orientation. our technical evaluation shows that thor's hammer can apply up to 4 n of force in arbitrary directions with less than 0.11 n and 3.9° of average magnitude and orientation errors. we also present virtual reality applications that can benefit from the force feedback provided by thor's hammer. using these applications, we conducted a preliminary user study and participants felt the experience more realistic and immersive with the force feedback. this paper introduced thor’s hammer, an ungrounded force feedback device that can create 3-dof force feedback. the technical evaluation demonstrated that the device can generate up to 4 n of continuous and precise force feedback in arbitrary directions. the informal user study showed promise in the device, provided insights regarding how users experienced the force feedback, and identified areas for which the device could be improved. together with the results from the technical evaluation and the user study, we believe that the new device may open up many possibilities in creating more realistic experiences in virtual environments. due to the 3d printed nature of the device, and its use of off-the-shelf components, the device can be easily replicated and operated without any grounding structures. since the use of propeller propulsion for 3-dof force feedback had not been investigated prior to this work, our focus was to build a proof-of-concept device. the device currently has several limitations and future work should seek to address them. for instance, while there was no mention of fatigue in the user study, the device is larger and heavier than most vr controllers and a prolonged use could cause fatigue. high latency of the feedback also limits the use of the device to scenarios with gradually changing force feedback. future work could also include an expansion to a 6-dof force feedback device by using rotor configurations that support omnidirectional actuation [11] and a more controlled psychophysical study investigating how users perceive the force created by propeller propulsion compared to a grounded force feedback device and the effect of unintended haptic sensations such as vibration and torque on perception of the force.",522
Transforming Last-mile Logistics: Opportunities for more Sustainable Deliveries,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657237,"road congestion, air pollution and sustainability are increasingly important in major cities. we look to understand how last-mile deliveries in the parcel sector are impacting our roads. using formative field work and quantitative analysis of consignment manifests and location data, we identify how the effectiveness of life-style couriers is contributing to both environmental and non-environmental externalities. this paper presents an analysis of delivery performances and practices in last-mile logistics in central london, quantifying the impacts differing levels of experience have on overall round efficiency. we identify eleven key opportunities for technological support for last-mile parcel deliveries that could contribute to both driver effectiveness and sustainability. we finish by examining how hci can lead to improved environmental and social justice by re-considering and realizing future collaborative visions in last-mile logistics. in this paper we have introduced last-mile parcel deliveries and life-style couriers to hci. through our empirical study of this domain in central london, we have shown how studying variation in delivery effectiveness of drivers and understanding their practices and routines can help identify opportunities for designing technology to support more effective delivery of parcels. from our qualitative field study, we have illustrated the importance of driver knowledge, personal relationships, and decision making about when to walk and how to navigate multistory and multipurpose buildings all contribute to driver effectiveness. exploiting this insight as a resource for design we have explored how hci can lead to new technology to help utilize the curbside better for deliveries, encourage better walking strategies that promote consolidation and collaboration, and help challenge policy frameworks and unsustainability of logistics and life-style couriers. we have identified eleven opportunities for hci from our empirical work to make novice drivers instantly better and help deliveries get to people (not postcodes) when delivering parcels in cities. we finish by, we hope, stimulating a new discussion in hci about how we can help bring about new and future business models in last-mile logistics that can more profoundly intervene in the last-mile to promote greater environmental and social justice.",523
CraftML: 3D Modeling is Web Programming,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657238,"we explore web programming as a new paradigm for programmatic 3d modeling. most existing approaches subscribe to the imperative programming paradigm. while useful, there exists a gulf of evaluation between procedural steps and the intended structure. we present craftml, a language providing a declarative syntax where the code is the structure. craftml offers a rich set of programming features familiar to web developers of all skill levels, such as tags, hyperlinks, document object model, cascade style sheet, jquery, string interpolation, template engine, data injection, and scalable vector graphics. we develop an online ide to support craftml development, with features such as live preview, search, module import, and parameterization. using examples and case studies, we demonstrate that craftml offers a low floor for beginners to make simple designs, a high ceiling for experts to build complex computational models, and wide walls to support many application domains such as education, data physicalization, tactile graphics, assistive devices, and mechanical components. in this work, we set out to explore the web programming paradigm as a viable alternative to the imperative programming paradigm for programmatic 3d modeling. we developed a new language, craftml, that offers a rich set of programming constructs familiar to web developers, such as declarative syntax, semantic tags, css, javascript, jquery, string interpolation, and templates. we showed examples and case studies as supporting evidence for concluding that the web programming paradigm is indeed a viable and beneficial alternative.",524
ForceBoard: Subtle Text Entry Leveraging Pressure,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657239,"we present forceboard, a pressure-based input technique that enables text entry by subtle finger motion. to enter text, users apply pressure to control a multi-letter-wide sliding cursor on a one-dimensional keyboard with alphabetical ordering, and confirm the selection with a quick release. we examined the error model of pressure control for successive and error-tolerant input, which was incorporated into a bayesian algorithm to infer user input. a user study showed that, after a 10-minute training, the average text entry rate reached 4.2 wpm (words per minute) for character-level input, and 11.0 wpm for word-level input. users reported that forceboard was easy to learn and interesting to use. these results demonstrated the feasibility of applying pressure as the main channel for text entry. we conclude by discussing the limitation, as well as the potential of forceboard to support interaction with constraints from form factor, social concern and physical environments. in this paper, we present forceboard, which allows users to type text with pressure with subtle motion movement of the finger. this pushes the limits of motion amplitude required for text entry. we conducted a series of user studies to determine the design strategies, including keyboard layout, width of cursor, feedback design, interaction logic and so on. in particular, we examined users’ ability to control pressure in a fast and inaccurate fashion. the empirical results and established error model of pressure control complemented prior research on modeling a person’s ability of accurate pressure control. based on the results, we adapted a widely used statistical decoding algorithm to interpret pressurebased text input. the results showed that after ten minutes of training, users could input 11 words per minute with forceboard. meanwhile, subjective user feedback revealed that forceboard was easy to learn and interesting to use. we conclude by discussing potential applications of forceboard as well as its limitations.",525
PageFlip: Leveraging Page-Flipping Gestures for Efficient Command and Value Selection on Smartwatches,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657230,"selecting an item of interest on smartwatches can be tedious and time-consuming as it involves a series of swipe and tap actions. we present pageflip, a novel method that combines into a single action multiple touch operations such as command invocation and value selection for efficient interaction on smartwatches. pageflip operates with a page flip gesture that starts by dragging the ui from a corner of the device. we first design pageflip by examining its key design factors such as corners, drag directions and drag distances. we next compare pageflip to a functionally equivalent radial menu and a standard swipe and tap method. results reveal that pageflip improves efficiency for both discrete and continuous selection tasks. finally, we demonstrate novel smartwatch interaction opportunities and a set of applications that can benefit from pageflip. in this paper, we explored the design and performance of pageflip, a technique that leverages corner-command mappings and supports command invocation and value selection in a single corner-drag action on smartwatches. we first examined the design parameters such as corners, angular segments and distance segments, and then compared the performance of pageflip with a standard swipe-tap method and a functionally equivalent radial menu. the results indicated that pageflip significantly increased the efficiency for both discrete and continuous tasks by combining multiple operations into a single action. finally, we used three applications to demonstrate suitable uses of pageflip for novel smartwatch interaction.",526
Inpher: Inferring Physical Properties of Virtual Objects from Mid-Air Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657231,"we present inpher, a virtual reality system for setting physical properties of virtual objects using mid-air interaction. users simply grasp virtual objects and mimic their desired physical movement. the physical properties required to fulfill that movement will then be inferred directly from that motion. we provide a 3d user interface that does not require users to have an abstract model of physical properties. our approach leverages users' real world experiences with physics. we conducted a bodystorming to investigate users' mental model of physics. based on our iterative design process, we implemented techniques for inferring mass, bounciness and friction. we conducted a case study with 15 participants with varying levels of physics education. the results indicate that users are capable of demonstrating the required interactions and achieve satisfying results. we presented inpher, a system for setting physical properties using mid-air interaction. the design is based on the ability of humans to express physical motion based on experience and intuition. our case study showed that users with little physics background were able to train bounciness, relative mass and friction of virtual objects. the results indicate that it is in fact possible to infer physical properties from interactions with virtual objects. our approach can be used as an integral part of content creation systems for novices. we envision many different applications, which can potentially incorporate our approach. examples include level editors, puzzle games, interactive systems for education and more.",527
Making Core Memory: Design Inquiry into Gendered Legacies of Engineering and Craftwork,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657232,"this paper describes the making core memory project, a design inquiry into the invisible work that went into assem-bling core memory, an early form of computer information storage initially woven by hand. drawing on feminist tradi-tions of situated knowing, we designed an electronic quilt and a series of participatory workshops that materialize the work of the core memory weavers. with this case we not only broaden dominant stories of design, but we also reflect on the entanglement of predominantly male, high status labor with the ostensibly low-status work of women's hands. by integrating design and archival research as a means of cultural analysis, we further expand conversations on design research methods within human-computer inter-action (hci), using design to reveal legacies of practice elided by contemporary technology cultures. in doing so, this paper highlights for hci scholars that worlds of hand-work and computing, or weaving and space travel, are not as separate as we might imagine them to be. by interrogating connections between textiles and engineering, and enlivening a forgotten legacy of woven software, our project brings important histories to hci today. here we suggest that hci’s gendered visions of innovation in the past create absences about what we can know in the present. doing this project meant facing the fact that perhaps every woman who could tell this story is now gone. and while the accounts of the engineers and astronauts are canonized through our achievements — our giant leap for all mankind — we may never know the experiences of the little old ladies. because we neglected to collect their stories in the past, we fail to know them in the present. reviving their accounts informs our contemporary understanding of what innovation looks like and, in turn, shapes possibilities for building technology otherwise.",528
Augmenting Code with In Situ Visualizations to Aid Program Understanding,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657233,"programmers must draw explicit connections between their code and runtime state to properly assess the correctness of their programs. however, debugging tools often decouple the program state from the source code and require explicitly invoked views to bridge the rift between program editing and program understanding. to unobtrusively reveal runtime behavior during both normal execution and debugging, we contribute techniques for visualizing program variables directly within the source code. we describe a design space and placement criteria for embedded visualizations. we evaluate our in situ visualizations in an editor for the vega visualization grammar. compared to a baseline development environment, novice vega users improve their overall task grade by about 2 points when using the in situ visualizations and exhibit significant positive effects on their self-reported speed and accuracy.",529
Pointing All Around You: Selection Performance of Mouse and Ray-Cast Pointing in Full-Coverage Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657234,"as display environments become larger and more diverse - now often encompassing multiple walls and room surfaces - it is becoming more common that users must find and manipulate digital artifacts not directly in front of them. there is little understanding, however, about what techniques and devices are best for carrying out basic operations above, behind, or to the side of the user. we conducted an empirical study comparing two main techniques that are suitable for full-coverage display environments: mouse-based pointing, and ray-cast 'laser' pointing. participants completed search and pointing tasks on the walls and ceiling, and we measured completion time, path lengths and perceived effort. our study showed a strong interaction between performance and target location: when the target position was not known a priori the mouse was fastest for targets on the front wall, but ray-casting was faster for targets behind the user. our findings provide new empirical evidence that can help designers choose pointing techniques for full-coverage spaces. with the increasing viability and appeal of wide angle and fullcoverage display environments it has become more important to evaluate the available interface-design choices, to ensure that these new types of systems are usable and practical. one of the key user actions to support in these new environments is digital object selection and targeting. we carried out a study that explored the effects of two relevant pointing techniques in targeting tasks around the room and the ceiling. we found that a mouse-based technique provides the fastest targeting interaction when the targets do not require the participant to move their body, but a ray-casting technique was superior for targets at larger angles. additionally, we discovered that the mouse technique has the advantage of enabling the cursor to be ""parked"" while the user looks elsewhere, and that the ray-casting technique enables better overlap of searching and targeting tasks when the user needs to find an object of interest in the room. our findings can help inform designers as they choose interaction techniques that best suit the intended environment, and subsequently support the success of interfaces that take advantage of the full physical environment for digital and augmented information in our future work and home spaces.",530
The Dark (Patterns) Side of UX Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657245,"interest in critical scholarship that engages with the complexity of user experience (ux) practice is rapidly expanding, yet the vocabulary for describing and assessing criticality in practice is currently lacking. in this paper, we outline and explore the limits of a specific ethical phenomenon known as ""dark patterns,"" where user value is supplanted in favor of shareholder value. we assembled a corpus of examples of practitioner-identified dark patterns and performed a content analysis to determine the ethical concerns contained in these examples. this analysis revealed a wide range of ethical issues raised by practitioners that were frequently conflated under the umbrella term of dark patterns, while also underscoring a shared concern that ux designers could easily become complicit in manipulative or unreasonably persuasive practices. we conclude with implications for the education and practice of ux designers, and a proposal for broadening research on the ethics of user experience. in this paper, we have provided an overview of the landscape of dark patterns from the perspective of ux practitioners, describing the breadth of these patterns as they currently exist and the potential uptakes for hci research and ux practice in further defining this ethical and value-laden phenomenon. we have recharacterized existing practitioner-led notions of dark patterns to reflect the strategies that designers activate when manipulating the balance of user and shareholder value, supporting both ethically-focused ux practice and future hci scholarship regarding ethics and values.",531
Charrette: Supporting In-Person Discussions around Iterations in User Interface Design,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657246,"as a rule, user interface designers work iteratively. over the course of a project, they repeatedly gather feedback, typically through in-person meetings, and update their designs accordingly. through formative work, we find that design software tools do not support designers in managing meeting notes and previous design iterations as a cohesive whole. this causes designers to rely on ad-hoc practices for organizing work, which makes it hard for them to keep track of relevant feedback and explain their design decisions. to address this problem, we present charrette, a system that allows designers to curate design iterations, attach meeting notes to the relevant content, and navigate sequences of design iterations with the associated notes to facilitate in-person discussions. in an exploratory user study, we evaluate how charrette affects designers' self-reported ease in handling feedback during face-to-face discussions, compared with using their own tools. we find that using charrette correlates with increased confidence and recall in discussing previous design decisions. in this paper, we examined the difficulties designers face in presenting their design process during in-person discussions. effectively presenting process requires both handling diverse feedback as well as we alternatives and history. through formative work, we identified three archetypical practices in design work we then implemented charrette, which provides software support for each of these practices. we evaluated charrette in a short-term exploratory comparative study with 12 professional designers to gauge how software tools to support these practices affected designers’ ease in discussing their process. from this evaluation, we show that, although they faced usability issues, designers readily leveraged explicit support for design history to ground discussion with previous work and feedback.",532
Design Within a Patriarchal Society: Opportunities and Challenges in Designing for Rural Women in Bangladesh,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657247,"this paper examines the opportunities and issues that arise in designing technologies to support low-income rural women in bangladesh. through a qualitative, empirical study with 90 participants, we reveal systemic everyday challenges that women face that form the backdrop against which technology design could potentially happen. we discuss how technology is already impacting women's lives, sometimes by reinforcing their subservient role in society and sometimes used tactically by women to gain a measure of agency. the issues raised by our participants concerning technology's place in their lives provide hci researchers with valuable guidance about what might (or might not) be appropriate to design for them. we also show how prevalent hci research and design strategies may fit more poorly than expected into rural women's lives, and we discuss possible alternative design directions, and the ethical and pragmatic trade-offs that they entail. our contribution is not to ""solve"" the problem of designing for low-income rural women, but to expand the hci community's understanding of technology design within deeply patriarchal societies. this paper unpacked opportunities for and challenges to designing technologies that empower rural, low-income women in bangladesh. our field study revealed systemic challenges that women face and identified barriers these challenges pose to the efficacy of prevalent hci research and design strategies. to move forward, we proposed ways to design within the patriarchal system, even if we wish to subvert it, and discussed the ethical and pragmatic trade-offs of such an approach. taken together, our findings expand the hci community’s understanding of technology design within deeply patriarchal societies.",533
This App Would Like to Use Your Current Location to Better Serve You: Importance of User Assent and System Transparency in Personalized Mobile Services,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657248,"modern mobile apps aim to provide personalized services without appearing intrusive. a common strategy is to let the user initiate the service request (e.g., ""click here to receive coupons for your favorite products""), a practice known as ?overt personalization."" another strategy is to assuage users' privacy concerns by being transparent about how their data would be collected, utilized and stored. to test these two strategies, we conducted a 2 (personalization: overt vs. covert) x 2 (transparency: high vs. low) factorial experiment, with a fifth control condition. participants (n=302) interacted with greenbyme, a prototype of an eco-friendly mobile application. data show that overt personalization affects perceived control. significant three-way interactions between power usage, perceived overt personalization and perceived information transparency was seen on perceived ease of use, trust in the app, user engagement and behavioral intention to use the app in the future. in addition, results reveal that perceived information transparency also promotes trust, which is negatively linked with privacy concerns and positively correlated with user engagement and product involvement. the current study demonstrates an initial exploration of the role of personalization and information transparency in enhancing user engagement and product involvement. we found that overt personalization is positively associated with users’ perceived control. results indicate that instead of the overt personalization and information transparency cues, users’ perceptions of overt personalization were significantly associated with privacy concern, user engagement and product involvement. moreover, power usage tended to explain significant variance in perceived control, perceived ease of use, trust, user engagement, product involvement, attitude toward application, behavioral intention, and purchase intention. based on the results, the current study provides suggestions to designers and developers. given the significance of power usage, user-centered design is essential to take into account the differential value of personalization and transparency for engendering usability in mobile and other applications among low- and high-power users. finally, to increase trust, reduce privacy concern and enhance user experience, features and cues suggesting overt personalization mechanism and high information transparency respectively should not only be present on the user interface, but made more apparent to them.",534
Pictures Worth a Thousand Words: Reflections on Visualizing Personal Blood Glucose Forecasts for Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657249,"type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2dm) is a common chronic condition that requires management of one's lifestyle, including nutrition. critically, patients often lack a clear understanding of how everyday meals impact their blood glucose. new predictive analytics approaches can provide personalized mealtime blood glucose forecasts. while communicating forecasts can be challenging, effective strategies for doing so remain little explored. in this study, we conducted focus groups with 13 participants to identify approaches to visualizing personalized blood glucose forecasts that can promote diabetes self-management and understand key styles and visual features that resonate with individuals with diabetes. focus groups demonstrated that individuals rely on simple heuristics and tend to take a reactive approach to their health and nutrition management. further, the study highlighted the need for simple and explicit, yet information-rich design. effective visualizations were found to utilize common metaphors alongside words, numbers, and colors to convey a sense of authority and encourage action and learning. in this study we examined the perceptions and attitudes of individuals with type 2 diabetes recruited from low literacy populations towards visual representations of personalized blood glucose forecasts. the findings emphasize the importance of actionable, direct, simple, and information rich visualizations. these findings highlight the need for future work investigating the most effective ways of communicating health information and uncertainty in lowrisk contexts where individuals have the agency to make decisions.",535
Pac-Many: Movement Behavior when Playing Collaborative and Competitive Games on Large Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657240,"previous work has shown that large high resolution displays (lhrds) can enhance collaboration between users. as lhrds allow free movement in front of the screen, an understanding of movement behavior is required to build successful interfaces for these devices. this paper presents pac-many; a multiplayer version of the classical computer game pac-man to study group dynamics when using lhrds. we utilized smartphones as game controllers to enable free movement while playing the game. in a lab study, using a 4m × 1m lhrd, 24 participants (12 pairs) played pac-many in collaborative and competitive conditions. the results show that players in the collaborative condition divided screen space evenly. in contrast, competing players stood closer together to avoid benefits for the other player. we discuss how the nature of the task is important when designing and analyzing collaborative interfaces for lhrds. our work shows how to account for the spatial aspects of interaction with lhrds to build immersive experiences. in this paper, we presented pac-many, a multiplayer game for lhrds inspired by the classical computer game pac-man. furthermore, we presented a lab study comparing the players’ behavior in a collaborative and a competitive playing mode. the results show that the players were socially engaged in the collaborative condition and shared tasks in the game. thereby the players minimized the physical effort and moved less in front of the display. in contrast, the competitive condition triggered physical action of the players. the implementation of pac-many allows an arbitrary number of players to join a game. furthermore, the game maze can be displayed on multiple distributed displays simultaneously. this allows us, in future work, to analyze the behavior of more than two players in front of one display. furthermore, we will compare playing pac-many remotely to collocated play.",536
BebeCODE: Collaborative Child Development Tracking System,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657241,"continuous tracking young children's development is important for parents because early detection of developmental delay can lead to better treatment through early intervention. screening tests, often based on questions answered by a parent, are used to assess children's development, but responses from only one parent can be subjective and even inaccurate due to limited memory and observations. in this work, we propose a collaborative child development tracking system, where screening test responses are collected through collaboration between parents or caregivers. we implement bebecode, a mobile system that encourages parents to independently answer all developmental questions for a given age and resolve disagreements through chatting, image/video sharing, or asking a third person. a 4-week deployment study of bebecode with 12 families found that parents had approximately 22% disagreements about questions regarding their children's developmental and bebecode helped them reach a consensus. parents also reported that their awareness of their child's development, increased with bebecode. in this paper, we presented the design and implementation of bebecode, a collaborative mobile system to assess child development. bebecode encourages parents to answer all developmental questions independently and resolve disagreements to reach a consensus via chatting, image/video sharing, and asking a third person. we conducted a 4-week deployment study and found that bebecode successfully helped parents participate in their children’s developmental assessment and resolve their disagreement to reach a consensus.",537
Beyond the Libet Clock: Modality Variants for Agency Measurements,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657242,"the sense of agency (soa) refers to our capability to control our own actions and influence the world around us. recent research in hci has been investigating soa to provide users an instinctive sense of ""i did that"" as opposed to ""the system did that"". however, current agency measurements are limited. the intentional binding (ib) paradigm provides an implicit measure of the soa, however, it is constrained by requiring high visual attention to a ""libet clock"" on-screen. in this paper, we extended the timing stimuli through auditory and tactile cues. our results demonstrate that audio timing through voice commands and haptic timing through tactile cues on the hand, are an effective alternative measure of the soa using the ib paradigm. they both address current limitations of the traditional method such as visual attention overload and lack of engagement. we discuss how our results can be applied to measure soa in tasks involving different interactive scenarios such as in mixed/virtual reality. current research on agency in the field of hci has been limited by agency measures based on subjective judgement. while the ib paradigm provides an implicit and quantitative measurement of the soa, it has limitations regarding high visual attention. here we provide two alternative techniques that employ audio timing through voice commands and haptic timing through tactile stimulation on the hand. our techniques allow measuring perception of time in an ib task, revealing non-significant differences with the traditional visual method (libet clock), but addressing high visual demand and lack of engagement. we believe this work will enable agency implication in hci applications. measuring users’ soa in broader modalities will allow exploring interaction techniques that give users an instinctive sense of control on the environment.",538
PokeRing: Notifications by Poking Around the Finger,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657243,"smart-rings are ideal for subtle and always-available haptic notifications due to their direct contact with the skin. previous researchers have highlighted the feasibility of haptic technology in smart-rings and their promise in delivering noticeable stimulations by poking a limited set of planar locations on the finger. however, the full potential of poking as a mechanism to deliver richer and more expressive information on the finger is overlooked. with three studies and a total of 76 participants, we informed the design of pokering, a smart-ring capable of delivering information via stimulating eight different locations around the index finger's proximal phalanx. we report our evaluation of the performance of pokering in semi-realistic wearable conditions, (standing and walking), and its effective usage for information transfer with twenty-one spatio-temporal patterns designed by six interaction designers in a workshop. finally, we present three applications that exploit pokering's notification usages.",539
Forgotten But Not Gone: Identifying the Need for Longitudinal Data Management in Cloud Storage,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657244,"users have accumulated years of personal data in cloud storage, creating potential privacy and security risks. this agglomeration includes files retained or shared with others simply out of momentum, rather than intention. we presented 100 online-survey participants with a stratified sample of 10 files currently stored in their own dropbox or google drive accounts. we asked about the origin of each file, whether the participant remembered that file was stored there, and, when applicable, about that file's sharing status. we also recorded participants' preferences moving forward for keeping, deleting, or encrypting those files, as well as adjusting sharing settings. participants had forgotten that half of the files they saw were in the cloud. overall, 83% of participants wanted to delete at least one file they saw, while 13% wanted to unshare at least one file. our combined results suggest directions for retrospective cloud data management. by investigating our participants’ perspectives on a stratified sample of files stored in their own google drive or dropbox account, we built a better understanding of the contents of cloud-storage accounts, identifying latent needs for retrospective file management tools. we used a stratified sample to measure a broad cross-section of files users retain in their cloud storage accounts, rather than focusing on the files most likely to arouse security and privacy concerns (e.g., files named “taxreturn2017.pdf” or that contain saved passwords). even so, we found that 83% of participants wanted to permanently delete at least one file from this sample of ten. this result highlights the disconnect between our participants’ desired file-management decisions and the high overhead of retrospectively managing thousands of files in a cloud storage account. thus, our results highlight the need for retrospective privacy mechanisms that empower users to manage the risks latent in their file archives without expending unreasonable effort.",540
"A Functional Optimization Based Approach for Continuous 3D Retargeted Touch of Arbitrary, Complex Boundaries in Haptic Virtual Reality",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657355,"passive or actuated physical props can provide haptic feedback, leading to a satisfying sense of presence and realism in virtual reality. however, the mismatch between the physical and virtual surfaces (boundaries) can diminish user experience. haptic retargeting can overcome this limitation by utilizing visio-haptic effects. previous investigations in haptic retargeting have focused on methods for point based position retargeting and techniques for remapping 2d shapes or simple 3d shape changes. our approach extends haptic retargeting to complex, arbitrary shapes that provide a continuous mapping across all points on a boundary. this new approach also allows for multi-finger interaction. we describe a functional optimization to find the ideal spatial warping function with different goals: a maximum mapping smoothness, a minimum mismatch between the real and virtual world, or the combination of the two. we report on a preliminary user study of different optimization goals and elaborate potential applications through a set of demonstrations. in this paper we introduced a new technique for continuous haptic retargeting of complex arbitrary 3d shapes based on a functional optimization. this optimization can have three goals, maximizing the smoothness (gradient of the mapping), minimizing position mismatch, or the combination of the two. we also described techniques for defining the boundary conditions for this optimization. from our preliminary user study we have shown that this technique can be useful when the mismatch between the two boundary conditions (surfaces) are under the just noticeable threshold. we believe these techniques can be readily applied to haptic retargeting of physical props in virtual reality, and we hope that this will enable further study and development of haptic retargeting techniques.",541
"Sense of Presence, Attitude Change, Perspective-Taking and Usability in First-Person Split-Sphere 360° Video",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657356,"this paper examines the sense of presence, attitude change, perspective-taking, and usability of a split-sphere, first-person perspective 360 degree video about gender inequality, in which people can choose to watch the narrative from the male or female character's perspective. sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to watch (1) the video in 360 degree split-view in a head-mounted display, (2) the same film as 180 degree in a hmd, or (3) a flat control version of the video on a laptop. the 360 degree split-sphere increased the viewers' feeling of personal responsibility for resolving gender inequality, desire to rewatch the video, fear of missing out, and feeling of missing the full story. the 180 degree video created the strongest sense of presence, embodiment, and understanding of the character. however, people with greater egocentric projection onto the male character felt less responsible for resolving gender inequality, particularly in the 360 degree split-view. this paper examined the sense of presence, attitude change, perspective-taking, and usability of a first-person, 360° split sphere video about gender inequality by comparing it with a 180° video and a flat video in a between-subjects experiment. the findings suggest that, while creating a lower sense of presence than the 180° video, the first-person, 360° split-sphere video developed a stronger personal responsibility about advancing gender equality. however, the 360° splitsphere video poses new challenges for the user experience: the users experienced fear of missing out, and had difficulty following the narrative, receiving only a fragmented storyline instead of being able to focus on the story. moreover, we should also be aware that freely choosing whose perspective to take in a split-view 360° video may reinforce rather than change preexisting stereotypes.",542
“I Hear You”: Understanding Awareness Information Exchange in an Audio-only Workspace,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657357,"graphical displays are a typical means for conveying awareness information in groupware systems to help users track joint activities, but are not ideal when vision is constrained. understanding how people maintain awareness through non-visual means is crucial for designing effective alternatives for supporting awareness in such situations. we present a lab study simulating an extreme scenario where 32 pairs of participants use an audio-only tool to edit shared audio menus. our aim is to characterise collaboration in this audio-only space in order to identify whether and how, by itself, audio can mediate collaboration. our findings show that the means for audio delivery and choice of working styles in this space influence types and patterns of awareness information exchange. we thus highlight the need to accommodate different working styles when designing audio support for awareness, and extend previous research by identifying types of awareness information to convey in response to group work dynamics. we presented a study that examined workspace awareness information exchange during an audio-only collaborative task. the results showed that concealing or exposing audio output in such a workspace had an impact on which workspace awareness information was exchanged between partners, and that this observed impact was also dependent on the working style partners chose to employ. these results highlighted that the relevance of workspace awareness information is not static but dynamic, changing according to how collaborators choose to work with sounds. our findings provide empirical evidence that audio can be used as a sole means for supporting nonvisual collaboration with shared menus and for maintaining workspace awareness and common ground during such collaborations. further, we identified which type of workspace awareness information was exchanged under different conditions, and thus further extended previous research by identifying what information is relevant and when, and should therefore be captured about collaborators’ interactions and conveyed to partners when designing workspace awareness support for non-visual collaboration.",543
User-Driven Design Principles for Gesture Representations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657358,"many recent studies have explored user-defined interactions for touch and gesture-based systems through end-user elicitation. while these studies have facilitated the user-end of the human-computer dialogue, the subsequent design of gesture representations to communicate gestures to the user vary in style and consistency. our study explores how users interpret, enact, and refine gesture representations adapting techniques from recent elicitation studies. to inform our study design, we analyzed gesture representations from 30 elicitation papers and developed a taxonomy of design elements. we then conducted a partnered elicitation study with 30 participants producing 657 gesture representations accompanied by think-aloud data. we discuss design patterns and themes that emerged from our analysis, and supplement these findings with an in-depth look at users' mental models when perceiving and enacting gesture representations. finally, based on the results, we provide recommendations for practitioners in need of ""visual language"" guidelines to communicate possible user actions. our analysis of user-defined gesture representations has defined guidelines and principles for designing symbolic communication of interaction in both academic papers and gesture-based systems. this study has furthered conversation on human-computer communication and the intentional use of graphical elements to improve clarity and consistency in symbolic communication. these findings can be used by researchers and designers alike to guide future creations of representations that will take end-user behavior and preference into consideration, refining the less explored system-side of the human-computer dialogue.",544
To Put That in Perspective: Generating Analogies that Make Numbers Easier to Understand,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657359,"laypeople are frequently exposed to unfamiliar numbers published by journalists, social media users, and algorithms. these figures can be difficult for readers to comprehend, especially when they are extreme in magnitude or contain unfamiliar units. prior work has shown that adding ""perspective sentences"" that employ ratios, ranks, and unit changes to such measurements can improve people's ability to understand unfamiliar numbers (e.g., ""695,000 square kilometers is about the size of texas""). however, there are many ways to provide context for a measurement. in this paper we systematically test what factors influence the quality of perspective sentences through randomized experiments involving over 1,000 participants. we develop a statistical model for generating perspectives and test it against several alternatives, finding beneficial effects of perspectives on comprehension that persist for six weeks. we conclude by discussing future work in deploying and testing perspectives at scale. in this work we have shown that perspective statements help people estimate unknown quantities and that the beneficial effects of perspectives can remain significant for at least six weeks after the time of exposure. we tested several automated policies for generating perspectives and found that each provides substantial benefits over a control condition without perspectives, demonstrating that it is both possible and relatively easy to improve reader comprehension at scale. interestingly, we found that a simple, global model for generating perspectives is competitive with a personalized policy. this is not to say that global approaches are always superior to personalized ones, but rather that one can construct effective domain-specific perspectives for a wide audience without elaborate optimization. encouraged by these results, we have since deployed perspectives in “instant answer” numbers returned by the bing search engine. the model developed in this paper was used to create a library of perspectives for country areas in terms of u.s. states, which was first evaluated by a third-party panel of human judges in a side-by-side comparison before being incorporated into the search engine. now, when the search engine receives a query from a user in the u.s. about the geographic area of a country, it displays a small piece of text comparing the country to a u.s. state. for example, as shown in figure 8, when responding to a query for the “area of pakistan”, the search engine puts the answer of “307,373 square miles” into perspective as “about twice the size of california”. with this first scenario successfully launched, we are actively working to add perspectives to other instant answers provided by the search engine. figure 8. an example perspectives generated by our model, rendered live on the bing search engine, which phrases the area of pakistan as twice the size of california. though the work presented here focuses on the prominent but relatively narrow domain of country-level statistics, the insights it reveals apply much more broadly. having established the importance of simple multipliers and familiar reference objects in generating effective analogies, the main challenge going forward is generalizing these ideas to arbitrary domains so that perspectives can be deployed and tested at scale. one approach to solving this problem is to replace domain-specific human feedback on the effectiveness of different perspectives with machine-learned models that can be automated across a variety of domains. for instance, in ongoing work similar to that of hullman et al. [10], we are creating a database of reference objects that covers a wide range of measurements and contains proxy features for gauging the familiarity and analogical suitability of these reference objects. these features include how often reference objects are mentioned in different text corpora, queried in search engines, and visited on wikipedia, all of which can be gathered automatically and easily localized to different subpopulations. we see these as important steps in utilizing online platforms to improve numerical comprehension among both authors and their audiences. we hope that the perspectives framework will not only aid producers and consumers of information, but also stimulate research in education, journalism, and cognitive psychology.",545
Addressing Network Anxieties with Alternative Design Metaphors,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657350,"optimism and positivity permeate discourses of smart interactive network technologies. yet we do not have to look too far or too deep to find anxieties knotting up on the horizon and festering below the network's glistening surface. this paper contributes a set of concepts, tactics, and novel design forms for addressing network anxieties generated through a design-led inquiry, or research through design approach. we present three technically grounded metaphors illustrated with examples selected from our exploratory design process. weaving together concepts from surveillance studies, cultural studies, and other areas of the humanities with our visual and physical design work, we help draw attention to under-addressed concerns within hci while proposing alternative ways of framing and engaging design issues arising with network technologies. this paper has contributed a set of concepts, tactics, and design forms for addressing network anxieties. we began by framing a territory of negative network affects within which to inventively find, frame, and create problems associated with network technologies. framing our inquiry around negative network affects directs us toward affective forces rather then easily quantifiable or statistically significant network effects. our use of this term “network affects” engages in intentional semantic slippage between psychological affect, or emotion, and philosophical theory of affect as visceral and vital forces extending beyond emotion that “drive us toward movement, toward thought and extension, that can likewise suspend us (as if in neutral) across a barely registering accretion of force-relations, or that can leave us overwhelmed by the world’s apparent intractability.” [44, p. 1] for our task of addressing network anxieties, we are drawn to affective registers for their capacity to spark imagination and propel us through overwhelming feelings of intractability toward the inventive framing and making of problems. the designs presented here, an rtd contribution in their own right, illustrated design tactics that help operationalize the design metaphors of edge cases, pervasive fields, and unique personal identifiers. these tactics are tools that others may use to address network anxieties by inventively framing problems or by affirmatively crafting responses. these tactics also function to reveal the thinking behind our own research through design process, responding to calls to demystify and explain design practice in hci [5,43,47,57], design metaphors have a rich history within hci. the alternative metaphors we’ve presented—grounded in technical networking discourse but redirected toward the negatively affective—help us see constructs such as clouds, smart homes, and personal digital assistants as metaphors by critically imagining alternatives (fog, cages, and spies, perhaps.) if we indeed want to address network anxieties along with other unwelcome aspects of interactive technology, we may well need new metaphors to do so. finally, we hope that we have also contributed to the corpus of work that employs theories and methods from the humanities and arts to hci. one way we sought to do so in this paper is to offer an approach to thinking and writing that is open and lively, that does not attempt to come to quick resolution, but rather endeavors to be generous and generative. we approached our making activities similarly, drawing inspiration from arts practices such as tactical media, social practice, and art intervention to provide a space for creative inquiry that is both playful and sincere.",546
Supporting Communication between Grandparents and Grandchildren through Tangible Storytelling Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657351,"grandparents and grandchildren that live apart often rely on communication technologies, such as messengers, video conferencing, and phone calls for maintaining relationships. while some of these systems are challenging for grandparents, others are less engaging for children. to facilitate communication, we developed storybox, a tangible device that allows sharing photos, tangible artifacts, and audio recordings of everyday life. we conducted a preliminary study with two families to identify design issues, and further refine the prototype. subsequently, we conducted a field study with four families for up to four weeks to better understand real-world use and examine inter-generational connectedness. we found that storybox was accessible, simple, and helped bridge the technological gap between grandparents and grandchildren. children communicated asynchronously in a playful and idiosyncratic manner, and grandparents shared past family memories. we provide insights on how to ease communication between different generations, engage them in sharing activities, and strengthen family relationships. in this paper, we present the design and implementation of a tangible storytelling system – storybox – for sharing photos, tangible artifacts, and audio recordings of everyday life. to better understand grandparents and grandchildren’s realworld use and examine connectedness, we evaluated storybox in a preliminary study with two families and a subsequent study with four families for up to four weeks. we found that storybox enabled children to express themselves freely in a playful manner, was simple to use, and helped bridge the intergenerational technological gap. we further provided insights on how to ease communication between different generations, engage them in sharing activities, and strengthen family relationships.",547
Tangible Tens: Evaluating a Training of Basic Numerical Competencies with an Interactive Tabletop,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657352,"basic numerical competencies developed in kindergarten form the foundations of math achievement. this indicates the importance of early interventions in the case of numerical difficulties. building on research on math manipulatives and tangible interfaces, we developed a training of basic numerical competencies using an interactive tabletop in combination with physical lego-like blocks. in an experiment, we evaluated the effectiveness of the training on children's learning of the partner number concept, basic numerical competencies and number line estimation, compared to a content-wise similar training with physical manipulatives and a human tutor. we observed significant increases in children's understanding of the partner number concept and basic numerical competencies in both training conditions, but no differential training effects. as children can play on the interactive surface with reasonable autonomy, it seems to provide a low threshold possibility to enrich kindergarten education on numerical concepts. the present study showed that trainings using physical manipulatives to teach the partner number concept can increase preschool children’s basic numerical competencies. building on findings from embodied numerical trainings, the interactive surface training was one of the first to harness haptic experiences in combination with an interactive tabletop to enrich math learning. the significant learning effects of the training on the interactive surface based on system feedback seem particularly interesting. as children can play the training game on their own, it seems to provide a low threshold possibility to enrich kindergarten education on numerical concepts.",548
"'You Can Always Do Better!"": The Impact of Social Proof on Participant Response Bias",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657353,"evaluations of technological artifacts in hci4d contexts are known to suffer from high levels of participant response bias---where participants only provide positive feedback that they think will please the researcher. this paper describes a practical, low-cost intervention that uses the concept of social proof to influence participant response bias and successfully elicit critical feedback from study participants. we subtly exposed participants to feedback that they perceived to be provided by people 'like them', and experimentally controlled the tone and content of the feedback to provide either positive, negative, or no social proof. we then measured how participants' quantitative and qualitative evaluations of an hci artifact changed based on the feedback to which they were exposed. we conducted two controlled experiments: an online experiment with 245 mturk workers and a field experiment with 63 women in rural india. our findings reveal significant differences between participants in the positive, negative, and no social proof conditions, both online and in the field. participants in the negative condition provided lower ratings and a greater amount of critical feedback, while participants in the positive condition provided higher ratings and a greater amount of positive feedback. taken together, our findings demonstrate that social proof is a practical and generalizable technique that could be used by hci researchers to influence participant response bias in a wide range of contexts and domains. our social proof intervention has a number of key benefits that make it practical for researchers and practitioners to implement. one of our aims was to create an intervention that is generalizable and reproducible. we demonstrated that our intervention can be applied in two distinct contexts—an online experiment and a field study with low-literate participants in resource-constrained settings. in both experiments, we used the same experimental procedure with minor variations and received similar results that prove the efficacy of our social proof intervention. compared to other techniques that aim to reduce response bias (e.g., randomized response [60] and unmatched count [50]), our intervention is low-cost, practical, easy to understand for organizations and participants, reproducible in different contexts (as we demonstrated), effective for both quantitative and qualitative feedback, and elicits critical feedback even when participants are evaluating a single artifact that is known to be associated with the researcher [15]. taken together, these benefits suggest that, with a small amount of adaptation (described below) the intervention could be used by hci researchers in a wide range of contexts and domains.",549
Teaching Language to Deaf Infants with a Robot and a Virtual Human,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657354,"children with insufficient exposure to language during critical developmental periods in infancy are at risk for cognitive, language, and social deficits [55]. this is especially difficult for deaf infants, as more than 90% are born to hearing parents with little sign language experience [48]. we created an integrated multi-agent system involving a robot and virtual human designed to augment language exposure for 6-12 month old infants. human-machine design for infants is challenging, as most screen-based media are unlikely to support learning in [33]. while presently, robots are incapable of the dexterity and expressiveness required for signing, even if it existed, developmental questions remain about the capacity for language from artificial agents to engage infants. here we engineered the robot and avatar to provide visual language to effect socially contingent human conversational exchange. we demonstrate the successful engagement of our technology through case studies of deaf and hearing infants. this paper describes the design of a unique dual-agent system that uses a physical robot and a virtual human to engage 6-12 month old deaf infants in linguistic interactions. our system was bolstered by a perception system capable of estimating infant attention and engagement through thermal imaging and eye tracking. we documented our experiences in designing for a unique population (deaf infants), and summarized the lessons and guidelines that we established over an iterative design process. our design was informed by experimental sessions spread over three years, highlighted here by three case studies. this system has been successful at soliciting infant attention, directing attention to the linguistic content, and keeping the infant engaged for developmentally appropriate lengths of time. we also observed instances of infants copying robot behavior, of infants producing signs displayed by the avatar, and of infants producing signs to the non-signing robot agent that they had observed the virtual human perform. these initial experiences give us hope that longer-term exposure to a system based on this work may be able to impact long-term learning in this unique population.",550
ExtraSensory App: Data Collection In-the-Wild with Rich User Interface to Self-Report Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657365,"we introduce a mobile app for collecting in-the-wild data, including sensor measurements and self-reported labels describing people's behavioral context (e.g., driving, eating, in class, shower). labeled data is necessary for developing context-recognition systems that serve health monitoring, aging care, and more. acquiring labels without observers is challenging and previous solutions compromised ecological validity, range of behaviors, or amount of data. our user interface combines past and near-future self-reporting of combinations of relevant context-labels. we deployed the app on the personal smartphones of 60 users and analyzed quantitative data collected in-the-wild and qualitative user-experience reports. the interface's flexibility was important to gain frequent, detailed labels, support diverse behavioral situations, and engage different users: most preferred reporting their past behavior through a daily journal, but some preferred reporting what they're about to do. we integrated insights from this work back into the app, which we make available to researchers for conducting in-the-wild studies. in this paper, we introduce the extrasensory app, a mobile application for collecting data in-the-wild, including sensor measurements and self-reported detailed labels of behavioral context. we validated this app in an in-the-wild study with 60 users. the app’s rich label-reporting interface was important to engage users with different behavior styles and phone-interaction preferences and to acquire detailed labels for over 300,000 minutes of diverse behavioral contexts. extrasensory’s history page showed to be very useful and the features it offered helped users recall their past context. the additional watch component turned out to be very helpful to keep the user-interaction from interfering with natural behavior. to maximize the utility of the watch, its prompts should be cleverly timed and require minimal reaction (single button press). ongoing data collection and re-training of real-time classifiers will improve the server guesses and notifications and make user interaction easier and less time consuming. we believe that the insights that we describe in this paper will inspire future designs of in-the-wild data-collection studies. the public version of the extrasensory app that we provide will allow for further collections of data and studies that use real-time context-recognition in-the-wild for various applications in health-monitoring, aging-care, and other domains.",551
Collaborative Live Media Curation: Shared Context for Participation in Online Learning,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657366,"in recent years, online education's reach and scale have increased through new platforms for large and small online courses. however, these platforms often rely on impoverished modalities, which provide limited support for participation in social learning experiences. we present collaborative live media curation (clmc), a new medium for sharing context and participation in online learning. clmc involves collaborative, synchronous collection, creation, and assemblage of web media, including images, text, video, and sketch. clmc integrates live media including streaming video, screenshares, audio, and text chat. we deploy and study livemâché, a clmc technology probe, in four situated online learning contexts. we discovered student and instructor strategies for sharing context and participating including creating curations in advance, sketching to illustrate and gesture, real-time transformations, sharing perspective, and assembling live streams. we develop implications through live experience patterns, which describe how spatial and computing structures support social activities. collaborative live media curation is a new medium for live cscw. prior live streaming forms do not afford collaborative, free-form assemblage of live modalities. by extending free-from web curation with synchronous collaboration and live media, clmc enables a new contextualization of live experience. by deploying the livemâché clmc probe in four online learning situations, we provoked new participatory online learning experiences. we observed how participants invoke new collaborative live media curation strategies for sharing context, grounding collaboration, and constructing meaning through the assemblage of media and performance of deictic gestures. like others, we found that shared context is based on common understanding of framing [14] and social construction of mutual understanding [4]. the strategies—creating shared curation space in advance, sketching to illustrate and gesture, real-time element transformations, sharing perspective, assembling web cam and screenshare streams—contribute new, concrete means for promoting collaborative meaning making through shared visual and social context. collaborative free-form web curation afforded new modalities for participation. prior forms limit most participants to limited modalities, such as text chat. clmc’s open-ended integration of media and modalities affords new opportunities for any participant to engage in the collection, broadcasting, and assemblage of media. finally, we articulated patterns of online live experience. prior live media platforms typically support a single activity pattern. for example, google hangouts supports the small team pattern, while twitch supports broadcast. clmc is more flexible, enabling participants to assign roles and assemble media to form small-team, broadcast, and touring patterns of live experience. participants can shift between patterns, using roles, to support dynamic social contexts. future work has the potential to provide value by exploring how new strategies for assembling and structuring media will support new forms of participation and shared context in situated live experiences.",552
"Measuring, Understanding, and Classifying News Media Sympathy on Twitter after Crisis Events",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657367,"this paper investigates bias in coverage between western and arab media on twitter after the november 2015 beirut and paris terror attacks. using two twitter datasets covering each attack, we investigate how western and arab media differed in coverage bias, sympathy bias, and resulting information propagation. we crowdsourced sympathy and sentiment labels for 2,390 tweets across four languages (english, arabic, french, german), built a regression model to characterize sympathy, and thereafter trained a deep convolutional neural network to predict sympathy. key findings show: (a) both events were disproportionately covered (b) western media exhibited less sympathy, where each media coverage was more sympathetic towards the country affected in their respective region (c) sympathy predictions supported ground truth analysis that western media was less sympathetic than arab media (d) sympathetic tweets do not spread any further. we discuss our results in light of global news flow, twitter affordances, and public perception impact. we presented a data-driven approach to tease out differences between western and arab twitter news reporting of the 2015 paris and beirut attacks, where we found evidence for differential coverage across the attacks. for sympathy bias, we found that western media tweets were less sympathetic when covering the beirut attacks, however western media was overall less sympathetic than arab media, even for paris. finally, based on our labeled data, we trained a deep cnn to predict sympathy from unlabeled data, and results further supported our ground truth analysis that western media had less sympathetic tweets than the arab media, across both attacks. as a more general framework, our work contributes to an understanding of media bias on twitter, and factors that may influence it, which are not necessarily limited to the studied attacks. we believe the methods we adopted are more widely applicable to other areas of computational journalism, and can serve as useful tools to better understand, expose, and design around media bias.",553
Defining Through Expansion: Conducting Asynchronous Remote Communities (ARC) Research with Stigmatized Groups,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657368,"researchers in hci have typically relied on face to face (ftf) methods for recruitment and data collection in their research with people living with hiv, whereas social scientists have adopted computer-mediated approaches to address concerns about data validity and access to this stigmatized population. in this paper, we use the asynchronous remote community (arc) research method to leverage hci instruments in an online format. arc successfully engaged people living with hiv in terms of participation and retention by providing a safe space to discuss their experiences. by expanding on past arc studies, we contribute to an ongoing conversation about defining arc and working towards increased data validity -- especially in stigmatized communities. we started this paper by exploring how computer-mediated interventions have helped researchers study plh in the social sciences. to contribute to the conversation on how hci researchers could conduct studies with stigmatized populations, we analyzed the suitability of the arc method for research with plh in an online platform. we also offered a glimpse of the analytic power that arc offers via data triangulation in order to validate findings. to summarize, the main contributions of our paper are: (1) the provision of five new lessons on how to apply the arc method in hci research via the application of the method to a highly stigmatized and isolated population, (2) the confirmation of lessons learned from previous arc research, (3) the introduction of a formal definition of the arc method, a list of minimum requirements for its application, and ways to determine its success, and (4) a contribution to the ongoing chi4good or good4chi discussion. to conclude, we argue that the arc method is indeed suitable for studying stigmatized individuals under an hci lens. we hope that this method not only helps the chi community conduct studies with hard-to-reach – or atypical– populations, but that it also helps balance out the benefits derived from such endeavors between researchers and participants.",554
ActiveErgo: Automatic and Personalized Ergonomics using Self-actuating Furniture,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657369,"proper ergonomics improves productivity and reduces risks for injuries such as tendinosis, tension neck syndrome, and back injuries. despite having ergonomics standards and guidelines for computer usage since the 1980s, injuries due to poor ergonomics remain widespread. we present activeergo, the first active approach to improving ergonomics by combining sensing and actuation of motorized furniture. it provides automatic and personalized ergonomics of computer workspaces in accordance to the recommended ergonomics guidelines. our prototype system uses a microsoft kinect sensor for skeletal sensing and monitoring to determine the ideal furniture positions for each user, then uses a combination of automatic adjustment and real-time feedback to adjust the computer monitor, desk, and chair positions. results from our 12-person user study demonstrated that activeergo significantly improves ergonomics compared to manual configuration in both speed and accuracy, and helps significantly more users to fully meet ergonomics guidelines. we present activeergo, the first active approach to improve ergonomics by providing automatic and personalized ergonomics through a combination of sensing and selfactuating workspaces. our user study results demonstrated that our prototype significantly improved users’ postures and assisted more users in satisfying ergonomics guidelines. activeergo was also significantly faster (2.2x) than the manual approach, and all participants preferred our system.",555
Presenting The Accessory Approach: A Start-up's Journey Towards Designing An Engaging Fall Detection Device,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657360,"this paper explores a design experiment concerning the development of a personalised and engaging wearable fall detection device customised for care home residents. the design experiment focuses on a start-up company's design process, which utilises a new design approach, which i name the accessory approach, to accommodate given cultural fit purposes of a wearer. influenced by accessory design, that belong neither to fashion nor jewellery, the accessory approach is a way of designing wearables that involve both functional and expressive qualities including the wearer's physical, psychological and social needs. the accessory approach is proven to enable first hand insight of the wearer's preferences, leading to in-depth knowledge and enhanced iterative processes, which support the design of a customised device. this type of knowledge is important for the hci community as it brings accessory design disciplines into play when wanting to understand and design for individual needs, creating engaging wearables design. this paper introduces a design experiment to facilitate the implementation of an accessory approach in a start-up company with the aim of developing an personal wearable fall detection device to be worn at all times by care home residents. through the accessory approach, the company, with the help of two jewellery design interns, was introduced to ethnographic methods to generate cultural fit purposes of the wearers. the benefit of this act established engaging relationships between the interns and the care home residents, for the interns to gain deeper insight of the wearer’s physical, psychological and social needs. such an accessory approach enabled the interns to acquire an empathic understanding of the persons they were designing for, and their personal preferences in an effective and fast manner. the insights inspired the interns to design the final prototype, pearl, functioning as a magnetic brooch covering the electronics of a fall detection device – in 16 different choices of customisation. these findings are of importance as the accessory approach functions as a skillset for the designers to connect with and get first hand insight of a wearer’s preferences, leading to in-depth knowledge of how to understand adorning factors and meet cultural fit purposes. this knowledge is of importance for the hci community as the accessory approach activates embedded emotional values of worn objects and determines them to be of relevance when designing wearable health technology for an engaging experience.",556
What Moves Players?: Visual Data Exploration of Twitter and Gameplay Data,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657361,"in recent years, microblogging platforms have not only become an important communication channel for the game industry to generate and uphold audience interest but also a rich resource for gauging player opinion. in this paper we use data gathered from twitter to examine which topics matter to players and to identify influential members of a game's community. by triangulating in-game data with twitter activity we explore how tweets can provide contextual information for understanding fluctuations in in-game activity. to facilitate analysis of the data we introduce a visual data exploration tool and use it to analyze tweets related to the game destiny. in total, we collected over one million tweets from about 250,000 users over a 14-month period and gameplay data from roughly 3,500 players over a six-month period. in this paper, by adopting a qualitative approach and by using the online-only multiplayer shooter destiny as a case study, we explored for which communication purposes players use twitter, which users constitute important members, and if twitter can help in explaining in-game activity. our study shows that while the volume of tweets and changes in sentiment are useful indicators for identifying potential events of interest, gameplay data can provide an additional means to assist in this regard. at the same time, our results suggest that twitter can act as a valuable source for contextual clues to help understand variations in in-game activity. our results also provide evidence that players use twitter for a variety of communication purposes, including the sharing of fan art and game guides, searching for other people to play with, for discussing game-related issues and, in certain instances, even private matters of community members, as well as – in case of streamers – for announcing on-going live sessions. in terms of influential community members, streamers maintain some of the most popular accounts besides the official game and developer affiliated accounts.",557
Veritaps: Truth Estimation from Mobile Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657362,"we introduce the concept of veritaps: a communication layer to help users identify truths and lies in mobile input. existing lie detection research typically uses features not suitable for the breadth of mobile interaction. we explore the feasibility of detecting lies across all mobile touch interaction using sensor data from commodity smartphones. we report on three studies in which we collect discrete, truth-labelled mobile input using swipes and taps. the studies demonstrate the potential of using mobile interaction as a truth estimator by employing features such as touch pressure and the inter-tap details of number entry, for example. in our final study, we report an f1-score of .98 for classifying truths and .57 for lies. finally we sketch three potential future scenarios of using lie detection in mobile applications; as a security measure during online log-in, a trust layer during online sale negotiations, and a tool for exploring self-deception. we are frequently subject to lying, and to date lack means of classifying lies on mobile devices beyond written text and speech. this leaves a large space of interaction open to deception. we explore the feasibility of a content-agnostic, sensorled approach to lie detection on smartphones that considers only taps and swipes. through three studies we presented empirical evidence for the feasibility of commodity lie detection using mobile interaction. first, we found significant differences in response times between lies and truths for simple mobile interactions. next, we reported on the individual interaction differences observed between lying and truth telling in a mobile version of the ultimatum game that encouraged lying. the study showed that some features of mobile interaction varies with the honesty of an action. specifically, properties of number entry were good indicators of deceit. last, we reported on a study where participants took part in a mobile dice game that incentivized lying. we trained a classifier on mobile sensor data that ignores the input data itself. we achieved 96% precision and 95% recall in truth detection, and 65% precision and 59% recall for lie detection. while promising, these results do not support reliable binary lie classification. instead, we suggest their use a means of improving peoples’ own near-chance level lie classification. based on the findings, we introduced veritaps: an optional layer in mobile interaction, allowing users to share truth assessments of their input. we presented three potential use cases of veritaps, across online form-filling, inter-personal communication, and personal reflection.",558
How the Experts Do It: Assessing and Explaining Agent Behaviors in Real-Time Strategy Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657363,"how should an ai-based explanation system explain an agent's complex behavior to ordinary end users who have no background in ai? answering this question is an active research area, for if an ai-based explanation system could effectively explain intelligent agents' behavior, it could enable the end users to understand, assess, and appropriately trust (or distrust) the agents attempting to help them. to provide insights into this question, we turned to human expert explainers in the real-time strategy domain --""shoutcasters""-- to understand (1) how they foraged in an evolving strategy game in real time, (2) how they assessed the players' behaviors, and (3) how they constructed pertinent and timely explanations out of their insights and delivered them to their audience. the results provided insights into shoutcasters' foraging strategies for gleaning information necessary to assess and explain the players; a characterization of the types of implicit questions shoutcasters answered; and implications for creating explanations by using the patterns and abstraction levels these human experts revealed. the results of our study suggest that explaining intelligent agents to humans has much to gain from looking to the human experts. the expert explainers in our case — rts shoutcasters — revealed implications into what, when, and how human audiences of such systems need explanations, and how realtime constraints can come together with explanation-building strategies. among the results we learned were: rq1 investigating the what’s and where’s of casters’ realtime information foraging to assess and understand the players showed that the most commonly used patches of the information environment were the actuators (“a” in the peas model). this suggests that explanation systems that currently support only performance measures should consider also presenting information from the actuators and sensors. rq2 the how’s of casters’ foraging revealed a common pattern, which we termed the a-e-p+s loop, and the most common cues and triggers that led shoutcasters to move through this loop. future explanation systems may be wellserved to prioritize and recommend explanations according to this loop and its triggers. rq3 as model explainer, the casters revealed strategies for “satisficing” with explanations that may not have precisely answered all the questions the audience had in mind, but were feasible given the time and resource constraints in effect when comprehending, assessing, and explaining, all in real time as play progresses. these strategies may be likewise applicable to interactive explanation systems. rq4 the detailed contents of the casters’ explanations revealed patterns of how they paired properties (“adjectives and adverbs”) with different objects (“nouns”) and actions (“verbs”). interactive explanation systems may be able to leverage these patterns to communicate succinctly about an agent’s tactics and strategies. ultimately, both shoutcasters’ and explanation systems’ jobs are to improve the audience members’ mental model of the agents’ behavior. as cheung, et al. [4] put it, “...commentators are valued for their ability to expose the depth of the game.” hopefully, future explanation systems will be valued for the same reason.",559
A Study of Urban Heat: Understanding the Challenges and Opportunities for Addressing Wicked Problems in HCI,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657364,"the urban heat island effect (uhi) is a phenomenon whereby cities tend to be hotter than suburbs. we frame the uhi as a ""wicked problem"" that poses a range of economic, healthcare, and social challenges. our paper examines how different stakeholders negotiate complex value systems, collect data, and rely on collaborative platforms to address the problem of urban heat. using documentary filmmaking as a research method, we conducted ethnographically-oriented interviews with participants including vulnerable communities, urban architects, microclimate researchers, and grassroots activists. our findings reveal that unlike problems that can be solved using traditional hci paradigms of distributed work, the uhi presents an entanglement of challenges that do not necessarily converge on a single solution. we conclude by discussing two opportunities for addressing wicked problems through social computing: knowledge systems for sharing hybrid data across domains and interactive forums for discourse among diverse actors. in this paper, we used site-specific interviews that followed a documentary filmmaking approach to investigate the uhi effect in sydney, australia. in a forthcoming manuscript, in-depth consideration will be given to filmmaking as a cinematic genre to understand how cinematic techniques can be used to capture nuanced aspects of participants’ lives. while methodology is not the primary contribution of this paper, we nevertheless reflected on how: filmmaking requires preparation and care to effectively elicit in-depth responses; delivers deep insights into people’s first-person perspectives; supports generative dialectic between participants; and entails new forms of accountability between stakeholders. the focus of this paper has been primarily to examine the practices, challenges, and approaches of different stakeholders working in the domain of urban heat. our study reveals heat as a complex problem that is interlinked with issues beyond individual thermal comfort, and involves economic, climate change, social justice, and public healthcare concerns. the technologically-mediated entanglements between stakeholders, information flow, and actions do not converge on a singular solution to uhi. however, our findings suggest that chi research can engage with wicked problems by developing: 1) knowledge systems for sharing hybrid data from personal sensors, scientific datasets, and first-hand observations; and 2) tools for supporting dialectic through larger-scale video collection, annotation, and sharing between stakeholders. above all, we hope our work has contributed to hci paradigms for holistically addressing the big challenges of our time.",560
It's a Wrap: Mapping On-Skin Input to Off-Skin Displays,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657375,"advances in sensing technologies allow for using the forearm as a touch surface to give input to off-skin displays. however, it is unclear how users perceive the mapping between an on-skin input area and an off-skin display area. we empirically describe such mappings to improve on-skin interaction. we collected discrete and continuous touch data in a study where participants mapped display content from an ar headset, a smartwatch, and a desktop display to their forearm. we model those mappings and estimate input accuracy from the spreads of touch data. subsequently, we show how to use the models for designing touch surfaces to the forearm for a given display area, input type, and touch resolution. mapping skin input to off-skin displays is a challenge for onskin interaction. interaction can be improved by employing mappings that more closely match a user’s perception. by applying mappings that are consistent with a user’s perception, the content on the display can be interacted with touches on the forearm in an unambiguous manner. our study revealed such mappings between on-skin input and off-skin displays. we collected touch data from participants mapping content from common display types to their arm, using both discrete and continuous touch input. skin-based interface designs can benefit from the derived models.",561
Designing in the Dark: Eliciting Self-tracking Dimensions for Understanding Enigmatic Disease,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657376,"the design of personal health informatics tools has traditionally been explored in self-monitoring and behavior change. there is an unmet opportunity to leverage self- tracking of individuals and study diseases and health conditions to learn patterns across groups. an open research question, however, is how to design engaging self-tracking tools that also facilitate learning at scale. furthermore, for conditions that are not well understood, a critical question is how to design such tools when it is unclear which data types are relevant to the disease. we outline the process of identifying design requirements for self-tracking endometriosis, a highly enigmatic and prevalent disease, through interviews (n=3), focus groups (n=27), surveys (n=741), and content analysis of an online endometriosis community (1500 posts, n=153 posters) and show value in triangulating across these methods. finally, we discuss tensions inherent in designing self-tracking tools for individual use and population analysis, making suggestions for overcoming these tensions. we contribute an understanding of the design of personal health informatics tools that leverage the self-tracking of individuals to better understand group-level characteristics of diseases. for diseases or health conditions where the relevant dimensions of the disease are not well understood, we outline a process for designing self-tracking tools in this context. we find there is value in examining different data sources to elicit the relevant dimensions of a disease. triangulation across these sources informs what constitutes the experience of disease, indicating it is feasible to capture the disease experience directly from people with a particular health condition.",562
Examining Wikipedia With a Broader Lens: Quantifying the Value of Wikipedia's Relationships with Other Large-Scale Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657377,"the extensive wikipedia literature has largely considered wikipedia in isolation, outside of the context of its broader internet ecosystem. very recent research has demonstrated the significance of this limitation, identifying critical relationships between google and wikipedia that are highly relevant to many areas of wikipedia-based research and practice. this paper extends this recent research beyond search engines to examine wikipedia's relationships with large-scale online communities, stack overflow and reddit in particular. we find evidence of consequential, albeit unidirectional relationships. wikipedia provides substantial value to both communities, with wikipedia content increasing visitation, engagement, and revenue, but we find little evidence that these websites contribute to wikipedia in return. overall, these findings highlight important connections between wikipedia and its broader ecosystem that should be considered by researchers studying wikipedia. critically, our results also emphasize the key role that volunteer-created wikipedia content plays in improving other websites, even contributing to revenue generation. in this paper, we presented results that identify and quantify relationships between wikipedia and the large-scale communities reddit and stack overflow. in general, we observe a one-way relationship in which wikipediainfluenced content adds value to the external communities, but no evidence of substantial contributions in the reverse direction is observed. this research highlights the value of examining online communities using a broad lens, as crosscommunity relationships can have large effects.",563
Identifying Speech Input Errors Through Audio-Only Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657378,"speech has become an increasingly common means of text input, from smartphones and smartwatches to voice-based intelligent personal assistants. however, reviewing the recognized text to identify and correct errors is a challenge when no visual feedback is available. in this paper, we first quantify and describe the speech recognition errors that users are prone to miss, and investigate how to better support this error identification task by manipulating pauses between words, speech rate, and speech repetition. to achieve these goals, we conducted a series of four studies. study 1, an in-lab study, showed that participants missed identifying over 50% of speech recognition errors when listening to audio output of the recognized text. building on this result, studies 2 to 4 were conducted using an online crowdsourcing platform and showed that adding a pause between words improves error identification compared to no pause, the ability to identify errors degrades with higher speech rates (300 wpm), and repeating the speech output does not improve error identification. we derive implications for the design of audio-only speech dictation. we reported on four studies to characterize and address the difficulty of identifying speech recognition errors when using audio-only speech input. study 1 revealed that by listening to audio clips alone, users could identify less than half of the speech recognition errors. we then addressed the most common type of error that participants had missed in study 1—errors where multiple words blended together— by inserting pauses between each word and varying speech rate in the audio output. the simple solution of inserting even a 1ms pause between words improved the ability to identify errors, while a fast speech rate made the task more difficult, and repeating the audio output had no effect. these findings have implications for speech-based text input for a variety of non-visual contexts, and an important avenue of future work will be to extend the investigation to accessibility for blind and visually impaired users.",564
Designing the Audience Journey through Repeated Experiences,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657379,"we report on the design, premiere and public evaluation of a multifaceted audience interface for a complex non-linear musical performance called climb! which is particularly suited to being experienced more than once. this interface is designed to enable audiences to understand and appreciate the work, and integrates a physical instrument and staging, projected visuals, personal devices and an online archive. a public premiere concert comprising two performances of climb! revealed how the audience reoriented to the second performance through growing understanding and comparison to the first. using trajectories as an analytical framework for the audience 'journey' made apparent: how the trajectories of a single performance are embedded within the larger trajectories of a concert and the creative work as a whole; the distinctive demands of understanding and interpretation; and the potential of the archive in enabling appreciation across repeated performances. technically complex and non-linear interactive performances place particular demands on audiences in terms of appreciating what is going on and ultimately in arriving at some kind of personal interpretation. our experience from climb! reveals how supporting audience understanding is a multifaceted challenge that touches upon several aspects of interaction design. the key insight to emerge from our work is that experience designers (composers, performers and technicians) need to carefully design audience journeys – or trajectories – to shape an unfolding understanding of a work. this is true both within a given performance (considering what the audience experiences before, during and after the show) but also across many performances over the lifetime of the work (so that audiences can compare different performances, for example). further complexities arise from the personal nature of interpretation which leads audience members to require various and different cues to scaffold their individual understandings, with these cues being spread across multiple interfaces, both projected and personal. we also note the potential of archives for capturing and making available supporting materials over the lifetime of a work, with archives being designed for audiences and with works perhaps becoming self-archiving. finally, we highlight three areas for future work. first, we have identified several areas in which the current interfaces can be improved, including incorporating live video into the projection, adding more cues for challenges and more interpretative resources in the app. we aim to refine the current interfaces and to evaluate these refinements in a further round of performances. this will also provide the opportunity to begin to explore the impact of longer sequences of performances. second, although beyond the current scope of climb!, personal screens clearly have the potential to support audience interaction with works of this kind (and may even lead people to expect it). previous hci research has explored approaches such as cheering and applauding [1], voting [21], participating in real-time generation of the score [16], or suggesting moods that prompt the performers to improvise [13]. it would be valuable to address such interaction more explicitly within the audience journey. third, the current archive doesn’t yet support the kind of personalised storytelling that was reported in [12], e.g., the combination of official documentation with people’s own media using templates. this might also extend to allowing people to weave their own photos, videos and comments into the archive, similar to examples of crowd sourcing rich media associated with music concerts [33] and marathon races [15]. and specialist versions of the archive might integrate and augment the digital score as a key facet of the experience.",565
Printed Paper Actuator: A Low-cost Reversible Actuation and Sensing Method for Shape Changing Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657370,"we present a printed paper actuator as a low cost, reversible and electrical actuation and sensing method. this is a novel but easily accessible enabling technology that expands upon the library of actuation-sensing materials in hci. by integrating three physical phenomena, including the bilayer bending actuation, the shape memory effect of the thermoplastic and the current-driven joule heating via conductive printing filament, we developed the actuator by simply printing a single layer conductive polylactide (pla) on a piece of copy paper via a desktop fused deposition modeling (fdm) 3d printer. this paper describes the fabrication process, the material mechanism, and the transformation primitives, followed by the electronic sensing and control methods. a software tool that assists the design, simulation and printing toolpath generation is introduced. finally, we explored applications under four contexts: robotics, interactive art, entertainment and home environment. in this paper, we present a paper actuator, which is a composite material printed by desktop fdm 3d printers. while many approaches to actuating papers have been introduced before, the main contribution of our paper is the design of the composite, which seems simple but indeed combines three physical phenomena: electrical resistive heating of conductive thermoplastic, shape memory effect, and bi-layer actuation. we hope to introduce our paper actuator as a low cost and easy-to-fabricate enabling material to the community.",566
Leveraging Semantic Transformation to Investigate Password Habits and Their Causes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657371,"it is no secret that users have difficulty choosing and remembering strong passwords, especially when asked to choose different passwords across different accounts. while research has shed light on password weaknesses and reuse, less is known about user motivations for following bad password practices. understanding these motivations can help us design better interventions that work with the habits of users and not against them. we present a comprehensive user study in which we both collect and analyze users' real passwords and the reasoning behind their password habits. this enables us to contrast the users' actual behaviors with their intentions. we find that user intent often mismatches practice, and that this, coupled with some misconceptions and convenience, fosters bad password habits. our work is the first to show the discrepancy between user intent and practice when creating passwords, and to investigate how users trade off security for memorability. in theory, good password hygiene and risk management are straightforward: strong, unique passwords for all accounts, but especially for more important ones. however, the proliferation of accounts, weak password policies, and difficulty remembering all of these passwords make good password behaviors hard to implement in practice. throughout this research, we have observed that users’ security perceptions and intent rarely match their security realities. some reasons for this lie in misconceptions about risk and a desire for convenience, identified by other researchers. but another large reason, uncovered by our research, lies in the sheer complexity of managing many accounts over a large time span – a task that is cognitively hard for humans. we have recommended development of tools that reduce this cognitive load and identify cases where password sharing increases user risk. our future research will investigate whether this kind of intervention can measurably improve user password strategies.",567
Impact Activation Improves Rapid Button Pressing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657372,"the activation point of a button is defined as the depth at which it invokes a make signal. regular buttons are activated during the downward stroke, which occurs within the first 20 ms of a press. the remaining portion, which can be as long as 80 ms, has not been examined for button activation for reason of mechanical limitations. the paper presents a technique and empirical evidence for an activation technique called impact activation, where the button is activated at its maximal impact point. we argue that this technique is advantageous particularly in rapid, repetitive button pressing, which is common in gaming and music applications. we report on a study of rapid button pressing, wherein users' timing accuracy improved significantly with use of impact activation. the technique can be implemented for modern push-buttons and capacitive sensors that generate a continuous signal. for this paper, we defined and empirically investigated an activation technique called impact activation. a user study showed ia to be superior to the traditional button activation methods for all performance metrics in a fast tapping task: ia had higher success rates, less asynchrony, and less variance (see figures 6 and 7). the performance gains were greater in the physical button condition than in the touch button condition. the benefit of ia is likely to be attributable to the stronger stimulation of the fingertip allowing the motor system to calibrate its outputs better in the fast, episodic tapping task. we hypothesize that ia is closer to users’ perceived activation point than a traditional button activation point is. the activation point design choice had a much greater effect on the mean of asynchrony than on its standard deviation. to the best of our knowledge, the design of buttons has not been approached before by exploiting findings from theories of temporal motor control. our work may reveal a new opportunity to understand why user performance has been much worse with touchscreen devices than physical input devices. in hci research, work on touch input has focused, for example, on the “fat finger problem” [28] and system latency [6, 35]. techniques such as ia that are motivated by motor control literature may complement the gains achieved in these areas. furthermore, it could address well-known performance impairments reported for touchscreen gaming [3, 36, 37]. we see several opportunities to build on this work. first, our results are limited to a particular modality combination: audio cue with visual feedback. we believe the benefit of ia will persist with other modalities, but it may be smaller. this remains a topic for future work. also, our experimental task was relatively short, so there may be some quickly obtained advantages to using ia, particularly for novice users. to assess the robustness of the effect, a longitudinal study should be carried out. longitudinal research would expose possible recalibration effects [30]. finally, our experiment tested two specific button designs. although these represent commonly used types, we see it as worthwhile to replicate the work with other button designs.",568
MindNavigator: Exploring the Stress and Self-Interventions for Mental Wellness,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657373,"mental wellness is a desirable health outcome for students. however, current personal informatics systems do not adequately support students in creating concrete mental health-related goals and turning them into actionable plans. in this paper, we introduce mindnavigator - a workshop in which groups of college students were invited to generate behavioral change goals to manage daily life stress and practice personalized interventions for two weeks. we describe the manner in which participants identified both stressors and pleasures to create actionable, engaging, and open-ended behavioral plans that aided in stress relief. we found that the social nature of the workshop helped participants understand themselves and execute self-intervention in new ways. through this practice, we build on prior studies to propose an analytical framework of personal informatics for mental wellness. we propose the mindnavigator—an approach to exploring the landscape of students’ stress and implementing personalized interventions for stress management through an engagement workshop. our work provides insights into the landscape of students’ stress, including their stressors, stress-relievers, goalsetting strategies, and goal-revision strategies. by illuminating how students manage stress with personalized interventions and describing the results using an analytical framework, we can better inform the design of pi systems for mental wellness. in our future work, we will implement our approach on a computing platform and will examine the long-term impact of mindnavigator on stress.",569
"""Only if you use English you will get to more things"": Using Smartphones to Navigate Multilingualism",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657374,"we contribute to the intersection of multilingualism and human-computer interaction (hci) with our investigation of language preferences in the context of the interface design of interactive systems. through interview data collected from avid smartphone users located across distinct user groups in india, none of whom were native english speakers, we examine the factors that shape language choice and use on their mobile devices. our findings indicate that these users frequently engage in english communication proactively and enthusiastically, despite their lack of english fluency, and we detail their motivations for doing so. we then discuss how language in technology use can be a way of putting forth mobility as an aspect of one's identity, making the case for an intersectional approach to studying language in hci. we studied multilingualism in smartphone use by indian users for whom english was not a native language. through data collected from five sites across india, we offered an enriched understanding of the factors that shape language preference on smartphones. we found that participants used english, even when they were more fluent in another language. we found that this preference was tied to mobility depending on participants’ backgrounds, and described how english-based smartphones helped or hindered participants’ use of language. we concluded with the merits of examining language through an intersectional lens for the design of multilingual interactive systems. we surmise that conducting future work in contexts where other languages take the place of english, such as mandarin chinese in china or afrikaans in south africa, could lead to further, important insights, given the paucity of research in the domain.",570
The Problem of Community Engagement: Disentangling the Practices of Municipal Government,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657385,"in this paper, we work to inform the growing space of digital civics with a qualitative study of community engagement practices across the breadth of municipal departments and agencies in a large us city. we conducted 34 inter-views across 15 different departments, including elected and professional city employees to understand how different domains within local government define and practice the work of engaging residents. our interviews focused on how respondents conceptualized community engagement, how it fit into the other forms of work, and what kinds of outcomes they sought when they did 'engagement.' by reporting on this broad qualitative account of the many forms the work of community engagement takes in local government, we are contributing to an expansive view of digital civics that looks beyond the transactions of service delivery or the privileged moments of democratic ritual, to consider the wider terrain of mundane, daily challenges when trying to bridge between municipal government and city residents. the empirical fieldwork we have reported here provides a characterization of the variety of practices that compose community engagement in a large municipality. rather than a narrower focus on the practices of engagement in a single domain or a specific department, we took an expansive view in order to better understand and compare the breadth of work occurring across the range of functional elements of municipal government. doing so contributes to a growing literature that takes an expansive view of civic interactions, looking beyond moments of rational deliberation, or service transaction. as the characteristics of engagement practices change between departments and projects so too do the needs and affordances of technology. for instance, digital civic interventions to support the goal of increasing institutional accessibility of public works require different affordances that a similar goal being pursued in public schools—the access points are different as is the meaning of community engagement. as others have pointed out, these competing logics and practices create unique challenges when working with public civic entities. by better understanding the practices of community engagement, digital civic interventions can be situated to the responsibilities of civic authorities as well as afford more productive participation from residents. however, this begs the questions of whether digital civics should provide tools and support for the work of community engagement as is—responding to user need, such as it were? or, do we design tools that reflect what we expect of civic authorities and residents alike in the work of governance? we pose these questions as a way to reflect what we, as an intellectual community, aspire to as we experiment with systems that have real consequences both for the people who use them and the people for whom they work.",571
Using Co-Design to Examine How Children Conceptualize Intelligent Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657386,"prior work has shown that intelligent user interfaces (iuis) that use modalities such as speech, gesture, and writing pose challenges for children due to their developing cognitive and motor skills. research has focused on improving recognition and accuracy by accommodating children's specific interaction behaviors. understanding children's expectations of iuis is also important to decrease the impact of recognition errors that occur. to understand children's conceptual model of iuis, we completed four consecutive participatory design sessions on designing iuis with an emphasis on error detection and correction. we found that, while children think of interactive systems in terms of both user input and behavior and system output and behavior, they also propose ideas that require advanced system intelligence, e.g., context and conversation. our work contributes new understanding of how children conceptualize iuis and new methods for error detection and correction, and will inform the design of future iuis for children to improve their experience. we conducted four consecutive cooperative inquiry design sessions with a group of seven children that focused on designing iuis with an emphasis on error correction. we constructed a conceptual model based on children’s understanding of iuis and found that the children conceptualize iuis as whole systems and expect advanced system intelligence. ds 4 (big props) elicited the richest themes, while interviewing the children and observing them interact with technology failed to elicit the same depth as the pd activities. we present new design recommendations for error correction for children that are aligned with their conceptual model. by integrating our work on understanding how children conceptualize iuis with prior work on techniques for improving accuracy, we can design better iui technology that is tailored towards children.",572
Rethinking Engagement with Online News through Social and Visual Co-Annotation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657387,"the emergence of fake news, as well as filter bubbles and echo chambers, has precipitated renewed attention upon the ways in which news is consumed, shared and reflected and commented upon. while online news comments sections offer space for pluralist and critical discussion, studies suggest that this rarely occurs. motivated by common practices of annotating, defacing and scribbling on physical newspapers, we built a mobile app -- newsr -- that supports co-annotation, in the form of graffiti, on online news articles, which we evaluated in-the-wild for one month. we report on how the app encouraged participants to reflect upon the act of choosing news stories, whilst promoting exploration, the critique of content, and the exposure of bias within the writing. our findings highlight how the re-design of interactive online news experiences can facilitate more directed, ""in-the-moment"" critique of online news stories as well as encourage readers to expand the range of news content they read. we report on the design of a mobile app, newsr, which encourages readers to interact critically with news stories drawn from both familiar and new sources of news. we conducted an evaluation of the app in-the-wild over a period of 4 weeks drawing upon current news stories. our findings are based upon qualitative analysis of data gathered form interviews and focus groups with 15 users. our work contributes to knowledge on critical engagement with news looking primarily at how users can annotate news stories in new ways. this also contributes to work on the social annotation of news, work that explores and challenges filter bubbles. our findings provide a set of implications for the design of news reading applications, that can be applied to designs and research that addresses how readers think about news sources, and in work that explores new ways to interact with the news. these design implications are presented in terms of challenges in such interfaces, challenges we argue, encourage critical reflection. we have already discussed how the curation of stories will affect user responses, and acknowledge our process selected stories around ‘othering’. as has been demonstrated, good content selection for presentation to users is key to engagement and reflection, and considering existing journalistic practice this is somewhat unsurprising as all news sources are edited and curated to evoke reactions from readers. therefore, this is a limitation of our study, and future work in this area may wish to explore content selection from a more diverse range of stories. in this paper we have looked at two modalities: the swipeable interface for choosing stories, and annotation through graffiti. we believe these are complementary. together, they push readers to explore new sources as the graffiti itself becomes a draw to the article. the swiping interaction is quick, and together with the piecemeal annotation of news (both in the type of content and how content is annotated), allow annotation over time, making newsr a better fit with reading with your pen and reading on the move.",573
Season Traveller: Multisensory Narration for Enhancing the Virtual Reality Experience,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657388,"in the same way that we experience the real-world through a range of senses, experiencing a virtual environment through multiple sensory modalities may augment both our presence within a scenario and our reaction to it. in this paper, we present season traveller, a multisensory virtual reality (vr) narration of a journey through four seasons within a mystical realm. by adding olfactory and haptic (thermal and wind) stimuli, we extend traditional audio-visual vr technologies to achieve enhanced sensory engagement within interactive experiences. using both subjective measures of presence and elicited physiological responses, we evaluated the impact of different modalities on the virtual experience. our results indicate that 1) the addition of any singular modality improves sense of presence with respect to traditional audio-visual experiences and 2) providing a combination of these modalities produces a further significant enhancement over the aforementioned improvements. furthermore, insights into participants' psychophysiology were extrapolated from electrodermal activity (eda) and heart rate (hr) measurements during each of the vr experiences. in summary, the research presented in this paper is one of the first systematic investigations into studying the effects of multisensory stimuli when integrated within an hmd as a way of enhancing sense of presence in vr experiences. multiple preliminary studies were conducted to finalise the smell stimuli regarding the delivery method, intensity, comfort, relaxation, and naturalness. the main study was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of multisensory stimuli in vr and highlighted significant improvements in scores for sensory factors, engagement, richness, and involvement when compared to traditional audio-visual vr experiences. additionally, our analysis based on psychophysiology measurements indicates opportunities for future work to effectively compare different factors contributing to participants’ sense of presence in multisensory vr.",574
Playing with Streakiness in Online Games: How Players Perceive and React to Winning and Losing Streaks in League of Legends,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657389,"streakiness refers to observed tendency towards consecutive appearances of particular patterns. in video games, streakiness is oftentimes inevitable, where a player keeps winning or losing for a short period. however, the phenomenon remains understudied in present online game research. how do players perceive streakiness? how does it impact player experience (px)? how should streakiness be taken into consideration for the design of px? in this paper, we address these questions through a qualitative study of player discussions about streakiness in league of legends. we found that players developed various ways to describe a streak. both winning and losing streaks negatively impacted px. players devised numerous strategies to manage streakiness, among which disengagement was a primary means. we analyze streakiness as a social construct through which players coped with complex game systems. we discuss design implications for managing streakiness in online games. in this paper, we studied px with streakiness in league of legends. players did not perceive streakiness as a manifestation of system randomness. our study of the two online forums revealed how they collectively developed various explanations and coping strategies which they claimed to be effective. by analyzing player online discussions as sensemaking, we highlight the socially constructed aspect of px where players’ own language and values are at play in interpreting, explaining, and enhancing their lived experience with gameplay. we call for more interpretive approaches in px research.",575
RoMA: Interactive Fabrication with Augmented Reality and a Robotic 3D Printer,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657380,"we present the robotic modeling assistant (roma), an interactive fabrication system providing a fast, precise, hands-on and in-situ modeling experience. as a designer creates a new model using roma ar cad editor, features are constructed concurrently by a 3d printing robotic arm sharing the same design volume. the partially printed physical model then serves as a tangible reference for the designer as she adds new elements to her design. roma's proxemics-inspired handshake mechanism between the designer and the 3d printing robotic arm allows the designer to quickly interrupt printing to access a printed area or to indicate that the robot can take full control of the model to finish printing. roma lets users integrate real-world constraints into a design rapidly, allowing them to create well-proportioned tangible artifacts or to extend existing objects. we conclude by presenting the strengths and limitations of our current design. we presented roma, an interactive fabrication system with an on-site and hands-on modeling experience. as a designer creates a new design using the ar cad editor, features are constructed by a robotic arm on the shared printing platform. the designer can rotate the platform, and use the partially printed physical model as a tangible reference for further design. roma enables the designer to integrate real-world constraints into a design rapidly and intuitively and allows the designer to directly design and print on and around a physical object.",576
Visualizing API Usage Examples at Scale,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657381,"using existing apis properly is a key challenge in programming, given that libraries and apis are increasing in number and complexity. programmers often search for online code examples in q&a forums and read tutorials and blog posts to learn how to use a given api. however, there are often a massive number of related code examples and it is difficult for a user to understand the commonalities and variances among them, while being able to drill down to concrete details. we introduce an interactive visualization for exploring a large collection of code examples mined from open-source repositories at scale. this visualization summarizes hundreds of code examples in one synthetic code skeleton with statistical distributions for canonicalized statements and structures enclosing an api call. we implemented this interactive visualization for a set of java apis and found that, in a lab study, it helped users (1) answer significantly more api usage questions correctly and comprehensively and (2) explore how other programmers have used an unfamiliar api. code examples are a key learning resource when learning unfamiliar apis. current tools for searching and browsing code examples often produce large collections of code examples that developers only have limited time and attention to review. in this paper, we introduce the concept of a synthetic code skeleton, which summarizes a variety of api usage features from a collection of code examples simultaneously in a single view. examplore instantiates the synthetic code skeleton with statistical distributions and allows a user to drill down to individual concrete code examples mined from 380k github repositories. we conducted a within-subjects study with sixteen java programmers and found that participants could answer more api usage questions correctly, with more detail and confidence, when using examplore compared to searching for usage examples online. many of these developers could envision examplore fitting into their development workflows, helping them explore unfamiliar apis. in future work, we hope to extend the code skeleton to support different programming languages and allow multiple related api methods to be the focal point of our visualization.",577
A Multi-site Investigation of Community Awareness Through Passive Location Sharing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657382,"local community ties are an important social resource, but research shows that these ties have been declining. the social significance of location information offers an opportunity address this decline and support local community building. through this research, we aim to understand if and how passive location sharing might be socially beneficial for communities. we conducted a deployment of movemeant, a location awareness app, across three different communities. following a research through design approach, we conducted 45 interviews with users of the system and community leaders. the findings suggest that communities face issues related to lack of awareness, cohesion, and identity. we show that the app can help increase awareness of important community resources. at the same time, the findings also show a negative effect of surfacing divisions in a community, which we discuss as a intermediate, perceptual step that may contribute to the amplification effect of technology. this work described the deployment of movemeant, a community app that uses anonymized and aggregated location information for network-to-person communication. across three field sites and interviews with 45 community members and leaders, we show how the information in the app engaged with the issues of awareness, cohesion, and community identity. we synthesized our findings to propose surfacing, the effect of technology to make differences within a community more salient, as an intermediate step towards amplification. we discussed how the information could potentially be used by community leaders as a tool for political action. other organizations are beginning to use such personal data for social benefit. for example, decode4 is a consortium of different organizations across the european union that is exploring how people might use their own data traces for the good of the wider community. our work suggests the promise behind such efforts in increasing awareness, but also the potential danger of unintentionally surfacing distinctions within the community at the same time. like architecture, data is given meaning by the way that people use it. more and more data is being collected and efforts taken to make that data available to the public. taking into account the potential unintended effects of sharing data is a concern for the future that we as designers and researchers should acknowledge and better understand.",578
"Trends and Trajectories for Explainable, Accountable and Intelligible Systems: An HCI Research Agenda",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657383,"advances in artificial intelligence, sensors and big data management have far-reaching societal impacts. as these systems augment our everyday lives, it becomes increasing-ly important for people to understand them and remain in control. we investigate how hci researchers can help to develop accountable systems by performing a literature analysis of 289 core papers on explanations and explaina-ble systems, as well as 12,412 citing papers. using topic modeling, co-occurrence and network analysis, we mapped the research space from diverse domains, such as algorith-mic accountability, interpretable machine learning, context-awareness, cognitive psychology, and software learnability. we reveal fading and burgeoning trends in explainable systems, and identify domains that are closely connected or mostly isolated. the time is ripe for the hci community to ensure that the powerful new autonomous systems have intelligible interfaces built-in. from our results, we propose several implications and directions for future research to-wards this goal. recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have far-reaching impacts on society at large. while researchers in the ml and ai communities are working on making their algorithms explainable, their focus is not on usable, practical and effective transparency that works for and benefits people. given hci’s core interest in technology that empowers people, this is a gap that we as a community can help to address, to ensure that these new and powerful technologies are designed with intelligibility from the ground up. from a literature analysis of 12,412 papers citing 289 core papers on explainable systems, we mapped the research space from diverse domains related to explainable systems. we revealed fading vs. burgeoning trends and connected vs. isolated domains, and from this, extracted several implications, future directions and opportunities for hci researchers. while this is only a first step, we argue that true progress towards explainable systems can only be made through interdisciplinary collaborations, where expertise from different fields (e.g., machine learning, cognitive psychology, humancomputer interaction) is combined and concepts and techniques are further developed from multiple perspectives to move research forward.",579
TopicOnTiles: Tile-Based Spatio-Temporal Event Analytics via Exclusive Topic Modeling on Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657384,"detecting anomalous events of a particular area in a timely manner is an important task. geo-tagged social media data are useful resource for this task; however, the abundance of everyday language in them makes this task still challenging. to address such challenges, we present topicontiles, a visual analytics system that can reveal information relevant to anomalous events in a multi-level tile-based map interface by using social media data. to this end, we adopt and improve a recently proposed topic modeling method that can extract spatio-temporally exclusive topics corresponding to a particular region and a time point. furthermore, we utilize a tile-based map interface to efficiently handle large-scale data in parallel. our user interface effectively highlights anomalous tiles using our novel glyph visualization that encodes the degree of anomaly computed by our exclusive topic modeling processes. to show the effectiveness of our system, we present several usage scenarios using real-world datasets as well as comprehensive user study results. this paper presented a tile-based visual analytics system topicontiles for anomalous event detection using geo-tagged social media data. topicontiles is mainly built upon a tilebased map interface using the novel topic modeling technique that extracts spatio-temporally exclusive topics with respect to the neighboring tiles. topicontiles also provides various visual encodings such as the glyphs, vertical grids, and heatmaps to facilitate anomalous event detection tasks. we showed usage scenarios using twitter data from new york city, where our system effectively reveals the event of the 2013 ing nyc marathon and the trayvon martin protest. furthermore, we conducted user studies showing the efficiency and the usability of topicontiles compared to other baseline settings. as our future work, we plan to extend our visual system to a real-time monitoring system that can solve various problems arising in urban areas such as natural disasters, crimes, and so on, by associating the geo-tagged textual social media data with other types of geo-tagged data, such as mobile user data.",580
"In a New Land: Mobile Phones, Amplified Pressures and Reduced Capabilities",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657395,"framed within the theoretical lens of positive and negative security, this paper presents a study of newcomers to sweden and the roles of mobile phones in the establishment of a new life. using creative engagement methods through a series of workshops, two researchers engaged 70 adult participants enrolled into further education colleges in sweden. group narratives about mobile phone use were captured in creative outputs, researcher observations and notes and were analysed using thematic analysis. key findings show that the mobile phone offers security for individuals and a safe space for newcomers to establish a new life in a new land as well as capitalising on other spaces of safety, such as maintaining old ties. this usage produces a series of threats and vulnerabilities beyond traditional technological security thinking related to mobile phone use. the paper concludes with recommendations for policies and support strategies for those working with newcomers. in reducing some of the challenges to social isolation and claiming some control over how and where integration into society takes place, mobile phone use contributes to and shapes a newcomer’s sense of freedom. these freedoms are, however, fragile as the participant narratives in this study express. the everyday pressures for newcomers amplify some of the disadvantages of constant and intense mobile phone use and potentially renders expected methods of managing mobile phone use weaker. mobile phone usage techniques that serve to strengthen these freedoms should be encouraged through guidance and also be complemented by specific techniques that, whilst attentive to the need for developing new freedoms, minimise potential harms of a close, constant and intimate relationship with the device.",581
Lessons from the Woodshop: Cultivating Design with Living Materials,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657396,"this paper describes an eighteen-month ethnography of timber framing at a tiny house construction program in port townsend, washington. this case exposes the intricate, ongoing processes that define a project where people learn to imagine, create, and ultimately maintain living materials. this case sheds light on the nature and scope of interaction design with living materials, an area of growing significance to hci scholarship on new materials, sustainable design, and digital fabrication. drawing from this project, we distill five lessons for design with living, finite materials. we end by discussing three emerging areas for hci: designing for material recuperation, collaborating with more-than-human actors, and approaching material properties as prototyping sites. hci’s interest in living, changing materials both in theory and in application has brought new challenges for designers. using timber framing as a lens, we have shown how centering the living qualities of materials — grappling with materials as non-human design collaborators — decenters designers and situates them in longer material histories that extend from traces of past encounters into future forms. in the woodshop we learned how design activity takes place alongside and through forces of decay and resurgence where new fabrication and resource scarcity meet, highlighting five characteristics of living materials that interrogate contemporary design practice: legible textures, defensive traces, reparative expressions, vital decay, and performative scarcity. we also learned that cultivating a design practice with these living material characteristics requires multiple methodological reorientations. the first is a move away from treating materials as passively awaiting designer intervention in order to see agency in action; looking more closely we find materials have their own lives that extend before and after the design encounter. in this approach, materials and non-human forces become active collaborators in design, and the human designer’s touch is just one of many important meeting points from the material’s historically grounded perspective. second is a move away from treating nature as somehow separate from hci practices or as a boundless source of raw materials and fabrication models; instead it suggests turning toward mutually constituted technology development pursuits that inhabit the messy intersections of ecological and industrial processes. when viewed as alive alongside humans, materials enact resource scarcity and limitations as central design engagements requiring recognition of the rhythms of ecological growth and decay for which hci practices are partially responsible. lastly, our work expands a program of work on computational composites and digital material within hci by exploring properties as temporary alignments between material proclivities, tools, and meanings rather than fixed attributes of the material to be manipulated. the designer’s task, we argued, is to work alongside living materials, exploring their possibilities and crafting more sustainable relationships in partnership with non-human collaborators.",582
Squadbox: A Tool to Combat Email Harassment Using Friendsourced Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657397,"communication platforms have struggled to provide effective tools for people facing harassment online. we conducted interviews with 18 recipients of online harassment to understand their strategies for coping, finding that they often resorted to asking friends for help. inspired by these findings, we explore the feasibility of friendsourced moderation  as a technique for combating online harassment. we present squadbox, a tool to help recipients of email harassment coordinate a ""squad"" of friend moderators to shield and support them during attacks. friend moderators intercept email from strangers and can reject, organize, and redirect emails, as well as collaborate on filters. squadbox is designed to let its users implement highly customized workflows, as we found in interviews that harassment and preferences for mitigating it vary widely. we evaluated squadbox on five pairs of friends in a field study, finding that participants could comfortably navigate around privacy and personalization concerns. in this work, we study the emergent practices of recipients of online harassment, finding from 18 interviews that many harassment recipients rely on friends and family to shield themselves from harassing messages. building on this strategy, we propose friendsourced moderation as a promising technique for anti-harassment tools. we developed squadbox, a tool to help harassment recipients coordinate a squad of friends to moderate aspects of their email. from a field study, we found that the use of friends as moderators simplifies issues surrounding privacy and personalization but also presents challenges for relationship maintenance.",583
Hoarding and Minimalism: Tendencies in Digital Data Preservation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657398,"digital data, from texts to files and mobile applications, has become a pervasive component of our society. with seemingly unlimited storage in the cloud at their disposal, how do people approach data preservation, deciding what to keep and discard? we interviewed 23 participants with diverse backgrounds, asking them about their perceived digital data: what ""stuff"" they kept through the years, why, how they used it, and what they considered important. in an iterative analysis process, we uncovered a spectrum of tendencies that drive preservation strategies, with two extremes: hoarding (where participants accumulated large amounts of data, even if considered of little value) and minimalism (where they kept as little as possible, regularly cleaning their data). we contrast and compare the two extremes of the spectrum, characterize their nuanced nature, and discuss how our categorization compares to previously reported behaviors such as filing and piling, email cleaners and keepers. we conclude with broad implications for shaping technology. we have shown how participants approached digital data preservation driven by a spectrum of underlying tendencies with two extremes: hoarding (where they accumulated large amounts of data, sometimes considered useless, experiencing in some cases challenges with managing it) and minimalism (where they tried to keep as little as possible, preventing or reacting to data as a way to be in control of it). there was nuance and variation within individuals, but tendencies close to both extremes of the spectrum appeared to be a way for participants to build their own identity in relation to data (i have data therefore i am vs. i am more than my data). the contribution and value of our work lies in: 1) bringing to light a spectrum of tendencies with hoarding and minimalism on two ends, characterizing them in depth, 2) comparing and contrasting different user behaviours, showing their common role for identity construction, 3) putting them in context compared to previously reported behaviors in the literature. these findings move forward our understanding of how people preserve digital data, a generally under-unexplored topic. furthermore, they have broad implications for shaping technology, opening rich possibilities for future work. now that we are in the foothills of a new world where seductive cloud storage is pervasive, it is critical to understand what drives people’s behaviors so that we can shape this world in a way that promotes informed decisions and well-being.",584
Mercury: A Messaging Framework for Modular UI Components,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657399,"in recent years, the entity--component--system pattern has become a fundamental feature of the software architectures of game-development environments such as unity and unreal, which are used extensively in developing 3d user interfaces. in these systems, ui components typically respond to events, requiring programmers to write application-specific callback functions. in some cases, components are organized in a hierarchy that is used to propagate events among vertically connected components. when components need to communicate horizontally, programmers must connect those components manually and register/unregister events as needed. moreover, events and callback signatures may be incompatible, making modular uis cumbersome to build and share within or across applications. to address these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, mercury, to facilitate communication among components. we provide an overview of mercury, outline its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using relay nodes, describe a reference implementation in unity, and present example systems built using mercury to explain its advantages. we have presented mercury, a hierarchical communication framework for software components, and described its specification, several use cases, motivations for its evolution, advantages and limitations of its design, and a reference implementation in unity. mercury allows programmers to achieve complex routing behavior easily, while focusing almost entirely on how software components (both local and remote) respond to messages.",585
Characterizing Finger Pitch and Roll Orientation During Atomic Touch Actions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657390,"atomic interactions in touch interfaces, like tap, drag, and flick, are well understood in terms of interaction design, but less is known about their physical performance characteristics. we carried out a study to gather baseline data about finger pitch and roll orientation during atomic touch input actions. our results show differences in orientation and range for different fingers, hands, and actions, and we analyse the effect of tablet angle. our data provides designers and researchers with a new resource to better understand what interactions are possible in different settings ( e.g.  when using the left or right hand), to design novel interaction techniques that use orientation as input (e.g. using finger tilt as an implicit mode), and to determine whether new sensing techniques are feasible (e.g. using fingerprints for identifying specific finger touches). the performance characteristics of atomic touch interactions, such as tap, drag, scale, rotation and flick, have been extensively studied. however, less is known regarding how they are carried out by users. in this paper we studied the natural pitch and roll orientation of all ten fingers while performing such actions. we used an imu in a low cost and easily reproducible setup to accurately measure finger orientation. our results provide a set of baselines about pitch and roll orientation for all the fingers of both hands for one setting (a flat tablet in front of the user). we found that for a given hand, the little, ring and middle fingers are used in a similar manner, whereas the thumb uses different range of orientations. additional analyses about how changing the angle of the tablet affects people’s finger orientations suggest that ranges of orientation tighten as the tablet pitch increases. our data provides designers and researchers with a new resource to better understand the use of pitch and roll as new degrees of freedom (e.g. using finger pitch as a secondary mode) and to determine whether new sensing techniques are feasible (e.g. using fingerprints for identifying specific finger touches).",586
Extending Manual Drawing Practices with Artist-Centric Programming Tools,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657391,"procedural art, or art made with programming, suggests opportunities to extend traditional arts like painting and drawing; however, this potential is limited by tools that conflict with manual practices. programming languages present learning barriers and manual drawing input is not a first class primitive in common programming models. we hypothesize that by developing programming languages and environments that align with how manual artists work, we can build procedural systems that enhance, rather than displace, manual art. to explore this, we developed dynamic brushes, a programming and drawing environment motivated by interviews with artists. dynamic brushes enables the creation of ad-hoc drawing tools that transform stylus inputs to procedural patterns. applications range from transforming individual strokes to behaviors that draw multiple strokes simultaneously, respond to temporal events, and leverage external data. results from an extended evaluation with artists provide guidelines for learnable, expressive systems that blend manual and procedural creation. motivated by conversations with artists, we created dynamic brushes, a visual programming and drawing environment for blending manual and procedural production through personal tool creation. our evaluation demonstrated that tool development can be engaging for manual artists while providing opportunities to extend their established practice and style. we see future research opportunities in developing mechanisms to support artists in visualizing, recording and inspecting drawing behaviors, and experimenting with different brush primitives to support procedural control over brush textures and physics. overall, we are excited about the potential of domain-specific programming languages to foster broader participation in creative system development.",587
Sensing Interruptibility in the Office: A Field Study on the Use of Biometric and Computer Interaction Sensors,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657392,"knowledge workers experience many interruptions during their work day. especially when they happen at inopportune moments, interruptions can incur high costs, cause time loss and frustration. knowing a person's interruptibility allows optimizing the timing of interruptions and minimize disruption. recent advances in technology provide the opportunity to collect a wide variety of data on knowledge workers to predict interruptibility. while prior work predominantly examined interruptibility based on a single data type and in short lab studies, we conducted a two-week field study with 13 professional software developers to investigate a variety of computer interaction, heart-, sleep-, and physical activity-related data. our analysis shows that computer interaction data is more accurate in predicting interruptibility at the computer than biometric data (74.8% vs. 68.3% accuracy), and that combining both yields the best results (75.7% accuracy). we discuss our findings and their practical applicability also in light of collected qualitative data. in this paper, we presented the results of a two-week field study with 13 professional software developers in which we examined the use of a wide variety of biometric and computer interaction features to predict interruptibility. our analysis shows that we are able to predict interruptibility at the computer with 75.3% accuracy (a 26.6% improvement over the baseline) and that computer interaction features are more accurate than the biometric ones (74.8% vs. 68.3%). we further show that the best time windows to extract features vary across feature categories and that certain features can affect interruptibility over long periods of time. finally, we show that even a generally trained model can accurately predict interruptibility for new subjects to overcome the cold start problem, and that even small sets of samples can be used to rapidly improve the classifier. as a next step, we plan to generalize our model to a broader range of knowledge workers and explore its potential to actively reduce interruption cost by indicating the interruptibility status to co-workers and fostering undisrupted work.",588
Customizing Developmentally Situated Design (DSD) Cards: Informing Designers about Preschoolers' Spatial Learning,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657393,"to date, developmental needs and abilities of children under 4 years old have been insufficiently taken into account at the early stages of technology design. bekker and antle [6] created developmentally situated design (dsd) cards as a design tool to inform children's technology designers about children's development starting from 5 years of age. in this paper, we describe how we customized dsd cards for a specific developmental skill (i.e., spatial learning) of children between 2- and 4-year-olds for tangible interaction design. the cards were evaluated after a user study in which 19 participants from different backgrounds used the cards in three design workshops. our analysis of observational notes and online survey identify and discuss how specific card features support or limit use by our participants. we draw on our findings to set forth design considerations and possible refinements that make age specific knowledge about very young children's spatial learning to inform technologies based on tangible interaction. we customized and used dsd cards which were originally created by [6] as a knowledge transfer vehicle in a domain specific design space targeting children younger than 4 years old. based on our user study findings and experience, we present general considerations for the customization of the dsd cards for informing children’s technology designers and developers. the customization of the dsd cards is not only necessary when targeting users at different age groups within different design spaces, but also while using at different stages of a larger technology design process. thus, this study not only contributes to a design practice in a specific domain knowledge, but inspires any type of complex domain space with a wicked design problem or extreme target groups. as future work, we will revise the cards relying on the the findings and feedback from our user study, and reevaluate the customized cards in participatory design workshops which enable the participants to contribute to the customization in design-in-use studies, and later in game-jam sessions which have real-life constraints. moreover, a further study that compares the customized dsd cards with another age specific cards would be helpful to validate not only the effectiveness of our customized cards, but also contribute to better design considerations for age specific card-based design tools in general.",589
Framed Guessability: Improving the Discoverability of Gestures and Body Movements for Full-Body Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657394,"the wide availability of body-sensing technologies (such as nintendo wii and microsoft kinect) has the potential to bring full-body interaction to the masses, but the design of hand gestures and body movements that can be easily discovered by the users of such systems is still a challenge. in this paper, we revise and evaluate framed guessability, a design methodology for crafting discoverable hand gestures and body movements that focuses participants' suggestions within a ""frame,"" i.e. a scenario. we elicited gestures and body movements via the guessability and the framed guessability methods, consulting 89 participants in-lab. we then conducted an in-situ quasi-experimental study with 138 museum visitors to compare the discoverability of gestures and body movements elicited with these two methods. we found that the framed guessability movements were more discoverable than those generated via traditional guessability, even though in the museum there was no reference to the frame. in this paper, we revised framed guessability and provided an evaluation of this novel methodology for designing hand gestures and body movements for full-body interaction. the revised version of framed guessability that we introduced in this paper incorporates “frames” into the elicitation process, in order to provide a unifying context for applications –such as human-data interaction –in which there are not well-established design patterns or metaphors. during an elicitation study (in-lab), frames clue people in to which actions are more (or less) appropriate. the results of our experimental evaluation (in-situ –when all references to the original priming frame are removed) show that framed guessability significantly increases the discoverability of control actions, when compared to the gestures and body movements elicited with traditional guessability. the value of this design methodology rests on the unusual result that higher discoverability was attained with no in-situ priming. this work contributes to interaction design in two ways. (1) we illustrate that one facet that matters to the users of fullbody systems (in terms of “discoverability”) is establishing a connecting thread across control actions. this is in deep contrast with the idea that only standardized actions (e.g., pinch and zoom) can be easily discovered, and opens new opportunities for creatively crafting rich interaction designs. we will clarify this in the conclusion. (2) although we evaluated framed guessability with an interactive data visualization exhibit, it can be applied to a plethora of fullbody interaction scenarios -e.g., interactive installations for cultural heritage, interactive public art, and commercial devices such as smart tvs, in which users do not typically consult manuals before interacting. future work should explore what happens when users are also primed in-situ, i.e. the degree to which the number and nature of cues incorporated into final design space (e.g., visual cues, or environmental design cues) can improve the discoverability of control actions. we also believe that framed guessability can be used in scenarios that go beyond human-computer interaction: for example, to catalog the schemata that are triggered by specific frames, and to understand interconnected reasoning patterns that may be triggered by gestures and body movements.",590

""how prevalent are pie charts really?"" these questions intimate the role of interactive visualization in the real (online) world. in this paper, we present our approach (and findings) to answering these questions. first, we introduce beagle, which mines the web for svg-based visualizations and automatically classifies them by type (i.e., bar, pie, etc.). with beagle, we extract over 41,000 visualizations across five different tools and repositories, and classify them with 85% accuracy, across 24 visualization types. given this visualization collection, we study usage across tools. we find that most visualizations fall under four types: bar charts, line charts, scatter charts, and geographic maps. though controversial, pie charts are relatively rare for the visualization tools that were studied. our findings also suggest that the total visualization types supported by a given tool could factor into its ease of use. however this effect appears to be mitigated by providing a variety of diverse expert visualization examples to users. in this paper, we presented beagle, an automated system for collecting, labeling and analyzing visualizations created on the web. beagle supports a flexible design with two standalone components. the web crawler extracts svg-based visualizations from webpages, and was able to extract over 41,000 visualizations from the web. the annotator uses svgfocused classification techniques to label visualizations, and achieves 86% classification accuracy, in a multi-class classification test with 24 different visualization types. we then use the resulting visualization collection to study usage of the different visualization types across tools. we found that only a small fraction of webpages (0.05%) contain svg visualizations created using browser-based tools. furthermore, the vast majority of visualizations in the collection are covered by just four visualization types: bar charts, line charts, scatter charts, and geographic maps. and though they are hotly debated in the visualization community, pie charts are somewhat rare for the particular visualization tools that we studied. our findings indicate that in addition to tools that provide flexibility (e.g., d3), users may also benefit from visualization tools that facilitate fast ease of use by focusing on supporting a small set of visualization types.",591
Mediating Conflicts in Minecraft: Empowering Learning in Online Multiplayer Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657306,"multiplayer online games, such as minecraft, have the potential to be powerful sites for youth learning, but can be plagued by inter-personal conflicts. this brings the need for online moderation. however, only very little is known about the practices through which such moderation happens, or how socio-technical systems could be designed to enable 'safe' learning spaces online. to start addressing this gap, our research examines the existing mediation practices within a moderated minecraft server for children aged 8-13. as part of our 14 months long engagement, we triangulate data from participant observation, interviews, and analysis of server logs. we demonstrate how---in trying to 'keep peace'---the online moderators monopolised the conflict resolution process, essentially preventing the children from actively working with and learning from the experiences of conflict. in response to these findings, we present an alternative framework for online conflict mediation, suggesting ways in which existing conflict resolution techniques originating in prevention science could be re-interpreted for online multiplayer settings. this paper presents findings from a long term participatory engagement with a moderated minecraft server for young gamers (aged 8-13). by combining such ethnographic case study data with scholarship from learning sciences, we argue that the existing authoritarian moderating practices can not only prevent young gamers from actively engaging with and learning from conflicts they experience online; but can also reinforce a disempowering set of social behaviours and values more broadly. as a first step towards the design of alternative moderating models, we draw on prevention science interventions to articulate a set of principles to guide future designs.",592
GestAKey: Touch Interaction on Individual Keycaps,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657307,"conventionally, keys on a physical keyboard have only two states: ""released'' and ""pressed''. as such, various techniques, such as hotkeys, are designed to enhance the keyboard expressiveness. realizing that user inevitably perform touch actions during keystrokes, we propose gestakey, leveraging location and motion of the touch on individual keycaps to augment the functionalities of existing keystrokes. with a log study, we collected touch data for both normal usage (typing and hotkeys) and while performing touch gestures (location and motion), which are analyzed to assess the viability of augmenting keystrokes with simultaneous gestures. a controlled experiment was conducted to compare gestakey with existing keyboard interaction techniques, in terms of efficiency and learnability. the results show that gestakey has comparable performance with hotkey. we further discuss the insights of integrating such touch modality into existing keyboard interaction, and demonstrate several usage scenarios. in this work, we introduced gestakey, a technique that enabled multifunctional keystrokes on a touch-sensitive keycap, opening up new design opportunities for interactions on a keyboard. we developed a custom-made keycap and built the software and hardware systems to detect touch on individual keycaps. we conducted a log study and verified the feasibility of gestural interaction on keycaps. a controlled experiment showed that although subject to system imperfections, our technique still had a comparable overall performance. applications using the gestakey technology should leverage the flexibility of gestural input and tightly couple it with existing key functions. with this approach, we believe gestakey technology will enable the creation of intuitive, learnable, and efficient interaction experiences on keyboards.",593
How Social Dynamics and the Context of Digital Content Impact Workplace Remix,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657308,"as highlighted in recent work on remix in online content creation communities, people commonly take and appropriate digital content for new activities. less is known, however, about how people repurpose digital content as part of work. we report findings from an interview study with 19 individuals in which we explored how digital content in the workplace becomes a material for remix. our analysis emphasizes (i) how digital content is obtained from colleagues for remix, (ii) how content is made available for remix by others, and (iii) how digital content is transformed for remix. in attending to these broader processes of remix, we consider the roles of workplace technologies, such as those for file sharing, as well as social norms that mediate access, remix, and acknowledgement. we draw implications for design of technology that emphasize support for individuals in making digital content available for remix, and raising awareness of the context of that content. remix is a complex set of processes where individuals navigate technical systems and social dynamics to use coworkers’ digital content toward new purposes. co-workers may be implicated in these broader processes of remix through their involvement in raising awareness about content, making content available, and conceptually transforming content for reuse. the amount of co-worker involvement, in addition to the perceived contribution of digital content, impacts how individuals perceive acknowledgement and credit in workplace remix. further, the context of digital content impacts how it is understood to be available for remix, as well as the work that goes into making it available. designing technical systems to convey the nuance of context, as well as to acknowledge the tensions between social dynamics and technical systems, may support workflow and the remix of materials in the workplace.",594
Somewhere Over the Rainbow: An Empirical Assessment of Quantitative Colormaps,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657309,"an essential goal of quantitative color encoding is the accurate mapping of perceptual dimensions of color to the logical structure of data. prior research identifies weaknesses of 'rainbow' colormaps and advocates for ramping in luminance, while recent work contributes multi-hue colormaps generated using perceptually-uniform color models. we contribute a comparative analysis of different colormap types, with a focus on comparing single- and multi-hue schemes. we present a suite of experiments in which subjects perform relative distance judgments among color triplets drawn systematically from each of four single-hue and five multi-hue colormaps. we characterize speed and accuracy across each colormap, and identify conditions that degrade performance. we also find that a combination of perceptual color space and color naming measures more accurately predict user performance than either alone, though the overall accuracy is poor. based on these results, we distill recommendations on how to design more effective color encodings for scalar data. combining perceptual color models and color naming models leads to higher predictive accuracy for both time and error than either alone. this suggests that lower-level perception and language-level processes may both play a role in the interpretation of quantitative color encodings. we also observe that increasing perceptual and name differences correlate with higher judgment accuracy, but that this trend is non-linear, tapering off among the highest quartile of differences for both measures. that said, we believe the primary take-away is a need for caution, as neither the error model nor time model lead to accurate prediction of the observed experimental results (let alone for new, unseen conditions). improved models or measures could lead to more accurate predictions of user performance. some issues may arise from the triplet comparison task: perceptual color models are fit to pairwise discrimination judgments, and so may be less well-suited for the comparison tasks studied here. moreover, our measures of difference do not take into account either the relative color space locations or the magnitude of the underlying color distances, only their difference. in addition, the inclusion of color legends in each trial may affect the predictive utility of color models. if our experiments were re-run without a visible color legend – such that subjects must make similarity judgments based on perception alone – it is possible that the results might align more closely with color model predictions. we leave exploration of these possibilities to future research.",595
Two Kinds of Novel Multi-user Immersive Display Systems,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657300,"stereoscopic display is a standard display mode for virtual reality environments. typical 3d projection provides only a single stereoscopic video stream; thus co-located users cannot correctly perceive the virtual scene based on their own position and view. several works devoted to developing multi-user stereoscopic display, but the number of users is very limited or the technical implementation is complicated. in this paper we put forward two flexible and simple projection-based multi-user stereoscopic display systems. the first one, named tpa, is based on a triple-projector array and provides a 120hz active stereo for three users. two tpas can be combined to form a six-user system. the second one, named dpa, is a dual-projector and easy-implemented system providing individual stereoscopic video stream for two to six users. finally, a co-located multi-user virtual fireman simulation training system and a virtual tennis simulation system were created to verify the effectiveness of our systems. a multi-user stereoscopic projection display system extends the single view to a multi-view display, which is an effective display means to realize multi-user co-located collaboration. each user can watch the virtual scene through his/her single correct perspective view based on his/her own position or viewpoint while increasing their sense of reality experience and immersion. in this paper, two projection-based multi-user stereoscopic display systems are introduced. one is called tpa, which is based on a triple-projector array and can provide a 120hz active stereo for three or six users. the other is called dpa, which is a dual-projector and easy-realized system providing individual stereoscopic video stream for 2 to 6 users. both systems are flexible and easy to be implemented by researchers or engineers. they can produce multi-view systems supporting collocated collaboration such as the multi-user virtual fireman training system and the virtual tennis simulation system. the systems can also be used in many other applications such as synchronously playing powerpoints with different languages and playing movies with multi-language subtitles for multi-users. two problems remain to be settled to further improve the multi-user stereoscopic projection display technology. one is to enhance the refresh rate of the projector image. the inner image refresh rate of certain types of projectors is more than 120hz. for example, the panasonic pt-hz900 type lcd projector and the triple-chip dlp projector have a refresh rate of 480hz; and the double-speed dlp projector with rgbrgb6 phase color wheel has a rate of 240hz. however, these projectors remain outputting with the refresh rate of 120hz. for instance, the panasonic pt-hz900 projects each image four times to perfect crosstalk and residue shadow, while the 240hz dlp projector projects each image twice to improve the rainbow effect. theoretically, higher refresh rate of the above types of projectors may be used to extend user capacity. the second problem lies in the open/close switch rate of the shutter glasses. if the number of users increases, the open/close switch rate of the shutter should be improved in response, and the experiment has revealed overdriving zero crossing driving might be used for the open/close switch rate of lc shutter to support 360hz or higher. there is much room for improvement regarding multi-user projection display.",596
The Effects of Badges and Avatar Identification on Play and Making in Educational Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657301,"in our study (n=2189), we divided participants into 6 badge conditions: 1) role model badges (e.g., einstein), 2) personal interest badges (e.g., movies), 3) achievement badges (e.g., ""code king""), 4) choice, 5) choice with badges always visible, and 6) no badges. participants played a cs programming game, then used an editor to create their own level. badges promoted avatar identification (personal interest, role model), player experience (achievement, role model), intrinsic motivation (achievement, role model), and self-efficacy (role model) during both the game and the editor. independent of badges, avatar identification promoted player experience, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy. additionally, avatar identification promoted greater overall time spent in both the game and the editor, and led to significantly higher overall quality of the completed game levels (as rated by 3 independent externally trained qa testers). our study has implications for the design of badge systems and sheds new light on the effects of avatar identification on play and making. in this study, we have looked at how badges and avatar identification impact both play and making in an educational game. we found that certain badges could promote avatar identification (personal interest, role model), player experience (achievement, role model), intrinsic motivation (achievement, role model), and programming self-efficacy (role model) during both the game and the editor. avatar identification promoted player experience, intrinsic motivation, programming self-efficacy, and the total time spent playing and making. avatar identification also promoted other meaningful in-editor activity, such as playtesting time, etc. and led to significantly higher overall quality of the completed game levels (as rated by 3 independent externally trained qa testers). here, we’ve conducted a first study (n=2189) on alternative badge types, and a first study of badges and avatar identification in a making context. these findings contribute to both the literature on badges and avatars.",597
Full-Body Ownership Illusion Can Change Our Emotion,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657302,"recent advances in technology have allowed users to experience an illusory feeling of full body ownership of a virtual avatar. such virtual embodiment has the power to elicit perceptual, behavioral or cognitive changes related to oneself, however, its emotional effects have not yet been rigorously examined. to address this issue, we investigated emotional changes as a function of the level of the illusion (study 1) and whether changes in the facial expression of a virtual avatar can modulate the effects of the illusion (study 2). the results revealed that stronger illusory feelings of full body ownership were induced in the synchronous condition, and participants reported higher valence in the synchronous condition in both studies 1 and 2. the results from study 2 suggested that the facial expression of a virtual avatar can modulate participants' emotions. we discuss the prospects of the development of therapeutic techniques using such illusions to help people with emotion-related symptoms such as depression and social anxiety.",598
c.light: A Tool for Exploring Light Properties in Early Design Stage,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657303,"although a light becomes an important design element, there are little techniques available to explore shapes and light effects in early design stages. we present c.light, a design tool that consists of a set of modules and a mobile application for visualizing the light in a physical world. it allows designers to easily fabricate both tangible and intangible properties of a light without a technical barrier. we analyzed how c.light contributes to the ideation process of light design through a workshop. the results showed that c.light largely expands designers' capability to manipulate intangible properties of light and, by doing so, it facilitates collaborative and inverted ideation process in early design stages. it is expected that the results of this study could enhance our understanding of how designers manipulate light in a physical world in early design stages and could be a good stepping stone for future tool development. we presented the light design tool for demonstrating the light properties in the early design stages as a design element of the product. the tool comprised of physical modules and a mobile application, which for exploring both tangible and intangible properties of light. a design workshop was conducted and the eight findings could be discovered from the analysis. and we could discover the three values of the tool by grouping the findings. through the analysis the workshop and design outcomes, we were able to reveal that the tool supported utilization of the light properties and reduced the ideation gap through explorative and inverted design procedures. we also found the tool to naturally create a collaborative ideation environment. we expect this tool and the insights from the workshop will provide meaningful benefits to the designers who are in the early design stage of product design and to the development of the future light design tools.",599
Steering through Successive Objects,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657304,"we investigate stroking motions through successive objects with styli. there are several promising models for stroking motions, such as crossing tasks, which require endpoint accuracy of a stroke, or steering tasks, which require continuous accuracy throughout the trajectory. however, a task requiring users to repeatedly steer through constrained path segments has never been studied, although such operations are needed in guis, e.g., for selecting icons or objects on illustration software through lassoing. we empirically confirmed that the interval, trajectory width, and obstacle size significantly affect the movement speed. existing models can not accurately predict user performance in such tasks. we found several unexpected results such as that steering through denser objects sometimes required less times than expected. speed profile analysis showed the reasons behind such behaviors, such as participants' anticipation strategies. we also discuss the applicability of exiting performance models and revisions. in this study, we investigated straight stroke movements constrained by obstacles, which simulates a part of lassoing operations through icons. participants’ behaviors were significantly affected by the task parameters of interval (i), tolerance width (w), and obstacle size (s). yet, the observations did not match all expectations. although participants could accelerate more in longer intervals, the results for longer intervals did not always show an increase in the stroke speed. such unexpected behaviors have not been reported before, but are important for a better understanding of gui operations, because the dependent variables (mt and v) could not be accurately modeled by existing work. our proposed idsc model is simple, yet more accurate than previous work and forms a strong foundation for future models.",600
The Ethnobot: Gathering Ethnographies in the Age of IoT,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657315,"computational systems and objects are becoming increasingly closely integrated with our daily activities. ubiquitous and pervasive computing first identified the emerging challenges of studying technology used on-the-move and in widely varied contexts. with iot, previously sporadic experiences are interconnected across time and space in numerous and complex ways. this increasing complexity has multiplied the challenges facing those who study human experience to inform design. this paper describes the results of a study that used a chatbot or 'ethnobot' to gather ethnographic data, and considers the opportunities and challenges in collecting this data in the absence of a human ethnographer. this study involved 13 participants gathering information about their experiences at the royal highland show. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ethnobot in this setting, discuss the benefits and drawbacks of chatbots as a tool for ethnographic data collection, and conclude with recommendations for the design of chatbots for this purpose. the iot has increased the number of activities that are digitally mediated. in this new and complex landscape where many lateral connections between users and devices occur, understanding the simultaneous activities of large numbers of people has become increasingly important. this is essential to both understanding the existing terrain into which new technologies will be deployed, and for testing out complex prototype iot systems. this study has demonstrated that a simply implemented chatbot can provide useful data to begin to map out detailed events and actions in a new context. despite the small number of participants in this study, the simultaneous gathering of data from three or four participants by one ethnographer points to the possibility of scaling up participant numbers, ultimately enabling data capture from crowds. creating a chatbot that is more sophisticated and responsive is not just a case of implementing natural language programming, but will also require careful design. ethnographers will be best placed to consider the design of questions and general functionality of the chatbot, with a view to the capturing the specific data they wish to gather and how other study methods may complement this. when considering the deployment of chatbot for ethnographic data collection we recommend attention to the following: 1) a chatbot should be sophisticated enough to have sensitivity to the participants’ current situation and activities, so that it can act as a guide or an assistant in the areas that it is exploring 2) prompting subjects will achieve the best results 3) flexibility is necessary so that the subjects always have the option to input free-text and report on activities of their choosing whilst chatbots will not be a replacement for human ethnographers, it is clear that the role of the ethnobot as a remote and ever-present ethnographic tool has a widereaching value for hci research.",601
An Experimental Study of Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657316,"as cryptocurrencies gain popularity and credibility, marketplaces for cryptocurrencies are growing in importance. understanding the dynamics of these markets can help to assess how viable the cryptocurrnency ecosystem is and how design choices affect market behavior. one existential threat to cryptocurrencies is dramatic fluctuations in traders' willingness to buy or sell. using a novel experimental methodology, we conducted an online experiment to study how susceptible traders in these markets are to peer influence from trading behavior. we created bots that executed over one hundred thousand trades costing less than a penny each in 217 cryptocurrencies over the course of six months. we find that individual ""buy"" actions led to short-term increases in subsequent buy-side activity hundreds of times the size of our interventions. from a design perspective, we note that the design choices of the exchange we study may have promoted this and other peer influence effects, which highlights the potential social and economic impact of hci in the design of digital institutions. institutional design is a major area of study in the social sciences. the hci community has an opportunity to contribute to this conversation as many farflung institutions—from banks to marriage in second life—migrate to digital spaces. the methodologies for studying digital systems; the awareness of interface effects; and the keen eyes for bias, ethics, and inclusion in the hci community could add unique perspectives to the design of digital institutions. markets are an example of an enormously important institution that is becoming increasingly digitized, and market irrationality may be a problem in markets that design-thinking could help address. our specific application to cryptocurrencies is timely and urgent as new platforms are growing and potentially encouraging users to adopt risky trading strategies. our work provides an example of how peers in an online system can audit the system dynamics through experimentation with typical behavior. bots that randomly execute actions of normal users could provide a way to understand peer influence and other phenomena in a variety of online systems. these bots allow us to understand the causal impact of individual actions that can be taken by users in these systems. in studying the dynamics of cryptocurrency markets with this technique, we show that even trades worth just fractions of a penny can influence the nature of other much larger trades in the cryptocurrency markets we study. we observe an approximately two percentage point increase in buying activity after our buy interventions, and a cumulative monetary effect of 500 times the size of our interventions. while an increase of two percentage points might seem small for an individual action, in a large marketplace this amount is non-trivial. for example, at the time of writing apple stock on the nasdaq exchange had an average daily trading volume of 30 million usd, 2% of which would amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a day on that stock alone. designers of online markets should be aware of how minor changes in their systems that affect individual and collective behavior could have major social and economic impact.",602
Paragon: An Online Gallery for Enhancing Design Feedback with Visual Examples,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657317,"examples provide a source of inspiration for creating designs, but can they help improve the feedback process? supplementing design feedback with examples could help recipients see issues clearly, identify concrete steps for improvement, and integrate novel ideas. two online studies investigated how to support novices providing feedback on visual poster designs in an online context. study one found that feedback providers select poster examples that complement their feedback and align with a provided rubric. study two shows that feedback providers give more specific, actionable, and novel input when using an example-centric approach, as opposed to text alone. to support this, we designed paragon, an interface to efficiently browse examples using metadata. finally, we discuss implications for collecting examples from the web and structuring the design feedback process. in this paper, we explored the efficacy, role, and benefit of using examples in an online design feedback process. two randomized web experiments showed that online novice participants were capable of using examples and preferred to do so in providing feedback. feedback supplemented with examples were considered more specific, actionable, and novel by experts and they also tended to be longer than text-only feedback. this required more time to complete, however this additional workload did not seem detrimental, as measured by subjective scores of compensation fairness. finally, we have built an online gallery interface with filters using crowdsourced metadata to aid the process of finding useful design examples for feedback providers. while some participants responded favorably, others expressed frustration, surfacing the challenges in striking a balance between the additional cognitive load and the usefulness of such a mechanism.",603
"Personality Depends on The Medium: Differences in Self-Perception on Snapchat, Facebook and Offline",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657318,"we investigate self-perception in social media through the lens of personality theory. two mixed-methods studies involving 148 participants examine if people self-report different personality traits in social media compared with their offline traits. we first compare offline and facebook traits, finding that on facebook people are less neurotic, open and agreeable. a second study compared offline, facebook and snapchat traits, replicating and extending our initial results. again facebook personality was less neurotic and less open than offline. in contrast, snapchat personality was more extravert than both offline and facebook and more open than facebook. interviews indicate how personality differences arise from social media affordances. anxiety about audience judgments leads people to curate posts to appear less neurotic on social media, but the transience of snapchat promotes greater extraversion than offline and facebook. we discuss theory and design implications. two studies show novel findings documenting large, reliable personality differences in offline and online personality, and between social media platforms. on facebook people perceive their personality as less neurotic and open, which seems to arise from a desire to avoid controversy. snapchat, while also less neurotic is used in an open hypersocial manner, with some seeing themselves as more extravert than offline. these differences seem to arise from affordances of audience and ephemerality.",604
"""We Don't Do That Here"": How Collaborative Editing with Mentors Improves Engagement in Social Q&A Communities",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657319,"online question-and-answer (q&a) communities like stack overflow have norms that are not obvious to novice users. novices create and post programming questions without feedback, and the community enforces site norms through public downvoting and commenting. this can leave novices discouraged from further participation. we deployed a month long, just-in-time mentorship program to stack overflow in which we redirected novices in the process of asking a question to an on-site help room. there, novices received feedback on their question drafts from experienced stack overflow mentors. we present examples and discussion of various question improvements including: question context, code formatting, and wording that adheres to on-site cultural norms. we find that mentored questions are substantially improved over non-mentored questions, with average scores increasing by 50%. we provide design implications that challenge how socio-technical communities onboard novices across domains. in this study, we applied theory related to learning and communities of practice to a social q&a site, by using methods related to mutual engagement and formative feedback. we created help rooms in order to provide timely and formative feedback to novices about their questions before they post them. we also used those help rooms to study the utility of collaborative question drafts. to understand the effectiveness of our technique and the types of interactions it facilitated, we performed a one-month live study on stack overflow. our findings suggest that the quality of mentored novice questions is significantly different than that of questions that were not mentored. specifically, we found that mentors provided feedback that improved the question quality by: annotating each question with important information, including crucial context details, explaining attempted solutions, and adopting a tone that meets community standards. as a result, the average scores increased over 50%, and novices were extremely satisfied with their mentorship experience. further, we discuss how this study can expand to other communities through user insight before building and taking advantage of the flexibility of human mentors. in summary, our mentorship program improved the onboarding experience for novices and enabled mentors to improve their feedback skills. by involving users in making their own community more empathetic and supportive, we pave the way for a more engaged future generation of novices.",605
Using High Frequency Accelerometer and Mouse to Compensate for End-to-end Latency in Indirect Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657310,"end-to-end latency corresponds to the temporal difference between a user input and the corresponding output from a system. it has been shown to degrade user performance in both direct and indirect interaction. if it can be reduced to some extend, latency can also be compensated through software compensation by trying to predict the future position of the cursor based on previous positions, velocities and accelerations. in this paper, we propose a hybrid hardware and software prediction technique specifically designed for partially compensating end-to-end latency in indirect pointing. we combine a computer mouse with a high frequency accelerometer to predict the future location of the pointer using euler based equations. our prediction method results in more accurate prediction than previously introduced prediction algorithms for direct touch. a controlled experiment also revealed that it can improve target acquisition time in pointing tasks. we introduced turbomouse, a hybrid hardware and software latency compensation technique specifically designed for indirect interaction. turbomouse combines the velocity measured by the mouse and the acceleration reported by an accelerometer embedded in the mouse to predict cursor’s position using euler based equations. our first experiment showed that turbomouse appears as a good trade-off between latency reduction and introduction of disturbing side-effects that might be noticed by the user. our second experiment showed that turbomouse increases user performance in pointing task, especially in an environment with relatively high latency. future work will be focused on attempting to further minimize the side-effects of turbomouse for higher levels of latency compensation.",606
Modeling Perceived Screen Resolution Based on Position and Orientation of Wrist-Worn Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657311,"this paper presents a model allowing inferences of perceivable screen content in relation to position and orientation of mobile or wearable devices with respect to their user. the model is based on findings from vision science and allows prediction of a value of effective resolution that can be perceived by a user. it considers distance and angle between the device and the eyes of the observer as well as the resulting retinal eccentricity when the device is not directly focused but observed in the periphery. to validate our model, we conducted a study with 12 participants. based on our results, we outline implications for the design of mobile applications that are able to adapt themselves to facilitate information throughput and usability. we presented and validated a model that allows inference of perceivable screen content on wrist-worn devices given their position in relation to an observer’s eyes. the model is built on insights from vision science and considers properties of the human visual system to predict what information is visible to an observer. as a first step to provide useful tools for user interface designers, we implemented a tool to visualize how a given type of screen content is perceived depending on the distance and orientation of the smartwatch display w.r.t. to the observer. we thereby distinguish whether the device is actively observed, i.e. the user is directly looking at the display, or whether it is located in the peripheral field of view. given the output of our model, user interface designers can adapt the visual appearance of their applications in a way that assures that users are able to perceive the desired screen content.",607
Investigating Perceptual Congruence between Data and Display Dimensions in Sonification,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657312,"the relationships between sounds and their perceived meaning and connotations are complex, making auditory perception an important factor to consider when designing sonification systems. listeners often have a mental model of how a data variable should sound during sonification and this model is not considered in most data:sound mappings. this can lead to mappings that are difficult to use and can cause confusion. to investigate this issue, we conducted a magnitude estimation experiment to map how roughness, noise and pitch relate to the perceived magnitude of stress, error and danger. these parameters were chosen due to previous findings which suggest perceptual congruency between these auditory sensations and conceptual variables. results from this experiment show that polarity and scaling preference are dependent on the data:sound mapping. this work provides polarity and scaling values that may be directly utilised by sonification designers to improve auditory displays in areas such as accessible and mobile computing, process-monitoring and biofeedback. we investigated the effects of acoustic parameter choice on a number of data:sound mappings. we presented a study in which magnitude estimation was used to map how the perceived magnitude of a data variable changed based on a change in an acoustic parameter. polarities and scales were derived for each mapping. we found that the acoustic parameter used to convey a data variable had a significant effect on the listener’s perception of the magnitude of that data variable. this suggests that designing a data:sound mapping which is congruent with the listener’s mental model of how they expect the data value to sound in a sonification system is key to successful mappings and sonifications.",608
Acceptability and Acceptance of Autonomous Mobility on Demand: The Impact of an Immersive Experience,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657313,"autonomous vehicles have the potential to fundamentally change existing transportation systems. beyond legal concerns, these societal evolutions will critically depend on user acceptance. as an emerging mode of public transportation [7], autonomous mobility on demand (amod) is of particular interest in this context. the aim of the present study is to identify the main components of acceptability (before first use) and acceptance (after first use) of amod, following a user experience (ux) framework. to address this goal, we conducted three workshops (n=14) involving open discussions and a ride in an experimental autonomous shuttle. using a mixed-methods approach, we measured pre-immersion acceptability before immersing the participants in an on-demand transport scenario, and eventually measured post-immersion acceptance of amod. results show that participants were reassured about safety concerns, however they perceived the amod experience as ineffective. our findings highlight key factors to be taken into account when designing amod experiences. in the present study, we placed 14 participants in an immersive amod experience in order to compare the acceptability (before first use) and acceptance (after first use) of an amod system. we used a mixed methods approach, complementing acceptance questionnaires with a psychological needs-driven approach using ux cards. thereby, we were able to understand underlying factors which influence acceptability and acceptance. our results show that that participants were reassured regarding safety concerns they had expressed. nevertheless, the amod experienced during this study was perceived as not sufficiently effective. consequently, perceived usefulness and performance expectancy both decreased significantly. these results shed light on factors which are essential for an optimal amod experience. our study also revealed points of improvement, thereby providing leads to amod designers and researchers striving to develop a positive amod experience. we expect the results of this study to contribute to the development of user-centered amod and to inspire future studies in the context of new forms of mobility.",609
BioFidget: Biofeedback for Respiration Training Using an Augmented Fidget Spinner,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657314,"this paper presents biofidget, a biofeedback system that integrates physiological sensing and display into a smart fidget spinner for respiration training. we present a simple yet novel hardware design that transforms a fidget spinner into 1) a nonintrusive heart rate variability (hrv) sensor, 2) an electromechanical respiration sensor, and 3) an information display. the combination of these features enables users to engage in respiration training through designed tangible and embodied interactions, without requiring them to wear additional physiological sensors. the results of this empirical user study prove that the respiration training method reduces stress, and the proposed system meets the requirements of sensing validity and engagement with 32 participants in a practical setting. the fidget spinner is a popular toy that went viral in 2017. although it is fun to play with, the general perception is that a fidget spinner is a useless machine which has a function but no direct purpose. marketers sometimes claim that fidget spinners are a “treatment for people with attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, or anxiety,” and “a tool for focusing and relaxing.” however, there is no peerreviewed scientific evidence showing that fidget spinners are effective treatments for these conditions so far [29]. biofidget integrates biofeedback, biosensing, and respiration training mechanisms into the form of a fidget spinner. the details of the physical, physiological, and visual designs have been disclosed. the results of technical and preliminary user testing also show that the proposed system and method provide valid and playful experiences that turn a popular toy into a useful stress management tool.",610
Gender-Inclusive Design: Sense of Belonging and Bias in Web Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657325,"we interact with dozens of web interfaces on a daily basis, making inclusive web design practices more important than ever. this paper investigates the impacts of web interface design on ambient belonging, or the sense of belonging to a community or culture. our experiment deployed two content-identical webpages for an introductory computer science course, differing only in aesthetic features such that one was perceived as masculine while the other was gender-neutral. our results confirm that young women exposed to the masculine page are negatively affected, reporting significantly less ambient belonging, interest in the course and in studying computer science broadly. they also experience significantly more concern about others' perception of their gender relative to young women exposed to the neutral page, while no similar effect is seen in young men. these results suggest that gender biases can be triggered by web design, highlighting the need for inclusive user interface design for the web. much like there are well-understood principles from psychology governing user engagement or behavior in design, we argue for developing a comprehensive understanding of the psychology of inclusivity and bias in web interface design. this work begins to develop such a framework by examining ambient belonging in the context of gender bias. through a controlled experiment exposing participants to masculine and gender-neutral interfaces, we demonstrate that gender-biased design choices can significantly negatively impact women users of those web interfaces, whereas gender-neutral design was perceived positively by individuals of all genders. this highlights the potential consequences of non-inclusive design, and the importance of developing a systemic understanding of bias for inclusivity in web design.",611
Too Close and Crowded: Understanding Stress on Mobile Instant Messengers based on Proxemics,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657326,"nowadays, mobile instant messaging (mim) is a necessity for our private and public lives, but it has also been the cause of stress. in south korea, mim stress has become a serious social problem. to understand this stress, we conducted four focus groups with 20 participants under mim stress. we initially discovered that mim stress relates to how people perceive the territory in mim. we then applied proxemics-the theory of human use of space-to the thematic analysis as the rationale. the data revealed two main themes: too close and too crowded. the participants were stressed due to design features that let strangers or crowds into their mim applications and forced them to interact and share their status with them. based on this finding, we propose a set of implications for designing anti-stress mim applications. today, mim is one of the most popular communication tools. during the initial growth of mim, closeness and the large number of people connected through mim were competitive characteristics and were the reason why our participants used kakaotalk as their primary mim; it had the largest number of registered users in south korea. closeness and a large number of friends initially provided convenience. however, it now generates stress, and it has even become a social problem. therefore, it is time to rethink mim design with the aim of relieving stress while maintaining its early advantages. to begin this rethinking, we discovered, from the perspective of proxemics, two main themes: too close and too crowded. we found that the participants experienced stress with mim that is similar to the stress people experience in physical space. we presented three sub-themes for each main theme and highlighted the related design features to understand how current mim design features affect mim stress. this study also provided design implications for friends, chat rooms, and messages, which are key elements of today’s mim. in this study, we applied proxemics to understand mim stress. however, we think that proxemics can explain many more possibilities about our use of digital space. we wanted to know the specific differences the design features of mim make in terms of human spatial perception and which design principles make those differences; however, our study did not include these aspects. this study will contribute to future hci work that finds “the hidden dimension” in digital space.",612
Socioeconomic Inequalities in the Non use of Facebook,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657327,"use and non-use of technology can occur in a variety of forms. this paper analyzes data from a probabilistic sample of 1000 us households to identify predictors for four different types of use and non-use of the social media site facebook. the results make three important contributions. first, they demonstrate that many demographic and socioeconomic predictors of social media use and non-use identified in prior studies hold with a larger, more diverse sample. second, they show how going beyond a binary distinction between use and non-use reveals inequalities in social media use and non-use not identified in prior work. third, they contribute to ongoing discussions about the representativeness of social media data by showing which populations are, and are not, represented in samples drawn from social media. this paper provides three unique contributions. first, it moves beyond a dichotomous distinction between use and non-use to consider other types of relationships with social media. second, the results show how this finer-grained approach reveals socioeconomic inequalities not identified in previous work. third, it provides specific details about the types of populations we are, and are not, studying when we analyze data from social media.",613
Navigation Systems for Motorcyclists: Exploring Wearable Tactile Feedback for Route Guidance in the Real World,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657328,"current navigation systems for motor cyclists use visual or auditory cues for guidance. however, this poses a challenge to the motorcyclists since their visual and auditory channels are already occupied with controlling the motorbike, paying attention to other road users, and planing the next turn. in this work, we explore how tactile feedback can be used to guide motorcyclists. we present moving (motorbike vibrational navigation guidance), a smart kidney belt that presents navigation cues through 12 vibration motors. in addition, we report on the design process of this wearable and on an evaluation with 16 participants in a real world riding setting. we show that moving outperforms off-the-shelf navigation systems in terms of turn errors and distraction. in this work, we report on the design and evaluation of a tactile navigation kidney belt for motorcyclists called moving. we explored the systemic motorcycle vibrations on different parts of the body to infer an optimal on-body location for the placements of the vibration motors. the moving system consists of 12 vibration motors integrated into a kidney belt in order to provide tactile navigation cues to the rider. in a real world evaluation, we explored how such a system performs compared to an off-the-shelf (visual) navigation system. compared to other evaluations of wearable systems, we performed this evaluation in a real world environment providing a realistic setting. we showed that in this setting tactile cues outperform visual ones. in particular, motorcyclists using moving made less turn errors and perceive the system as less distracting compared to an off-the-shelf navigation system.",614
CodeTalk: Improving Programming Environment Accessibility for Visually Impaired Developers,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657329,"in recent times, programming environments like visual studio are widely used to enhance programmer productivity. however, inadequate accessibility prevents visually impaired (vi) developers from taking full advantage of these environments. in this paper, we focus on the accessibility challenges faced by the vi developers in using graphical user interface (gui) based programming environments. based on a survey of vi developers and based on two of the authors' personal experiences, we categorize the accessibility difficulties into discoverability, glanceability, navigability, and alertability. we propose solutions to some of these challenges and implement these in codetalk, a plugin for visual studio. we show how codetalk improves developer experience and share promising early feedback from vi developers who used our plugin. we grouped the numerous accessibility challenges faced by vi developers in using gui based programming environments into four categories, namely, discoverability, glanceability, navigability and alertability. we presented codetalk, a plugin for visual studio that enables vi developers to overcome some of these challenges. participants in the exploratory user study have given very positive feedback on the utility and potential of codetalk to improve accessibility. we also presented several possible research directions that emerge from this work.",615
Morphees+: Studying Everyday Reconfigurable Objects for the Design and Taxonomy of Reconfigurable UIs,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657320,"users interact with many reconfigurable objects in daily life. these objects embed reconfigurations and shape- changing features that users are familiar with. for this reason, everyday reconfigurable objects have informed the design and taxonomy of shape changing ui. however, they have never been explored systematically. in this paper, we present a data set of 82 everyday reconfigurable objects that we collected in a workshop. we discuss how they can inspire the design of reconfigurable interfaces. we particularly focus on taxonomies of reconfigurable interfaces. taxonomies have been suggested to help design and communication among researchers, however despite their extensive use, taxonomies are rarely evaluated. this paper analyses two established taxonomies - rasmussen's and roudaut's - using daily reconfigurable objects. we show relationships between the taxonomies and area for improvements. we propose morphees+, a refined taxonomy based on roudaut's shape resolution taxonomy. ad-hoc considering of existing reconfigurable objects has enabled researchers to use their affordance as well as quickly evaluate interactions with low-cost prototypes. this paper presents the first systematic study of reconfigurable everyday objects. we present a collection and analysis of 82 reconfigurable everyday objects to inform the design of reconfigurable interfaces. we revealed the similarity between two representative shape-changing interface taxonomies and areas for improvements, such as their subjective comprehension. we refined roudaut’s taxonomy by adding the modularity and size, and adjusting the other features. by looking at the materials of the objects, we provided a better understanding of how to implement the reconfiguration features. we hope this work generates new research directions by revisiting existing objects and broadening the research area of reconfigurable interfaces.",616
The Theory-Practice Gap as Generative Metaphor,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657321,"the theory-practice gap is a well-known concept in hci research. it provides a way of describing a space that allegedly exists between the theory and practice of the field, and it has inspired many researchers to propose ways to ""bridge the gap."" in this paper, we propose a novel interpretation of the gap as a generative metaphor that frames problems and guides researchers towards possible solutions. we examine how the metaphor has emerged in hci discourse, and what its limitations might be. our examination raises concerns about treating the gap as given or obvious, which could reflect researchers' tendencies to adopt a problem-solving perspective. we discuss the value of considering problem setting in relation to the theory-practice gap, and then explore derrida's strategy of ""reversal"" as a possible way to develop new metaphors to capture the relationship between theory and practice. the theory-practice gap is a well-known concept in hci research [7,8,9,20—22, 26]. it changes the way scholars see the relationship between theory and practice, and it has motivated a diverse set of research projects geared towards solving the problem of how hci theory can better support practitioners [3,6,22, 26]. in this paper, we propose interpreting the theory-practice gap as a metaphor. we use donald schön’s concept of generative metaphor [32] as an analytical framework to examine the theory-practice gap. we analyzed (1) different ways researchers have interpreted the gap, (2) reasons why researchers prioritize some problematic features of the theory-practice relationship and ignore others, (3) reasons why researchers propose certain solutions to the gap problem, and (4) the limitations of the problem-solving perspective as it pertains to the theory-practice gap. has the gap changed? has it grown wider or narrower? or has the time come to explore new metaphors in more depth? these are potentially interesting and important questions to consider in the service of forging stronger connections between theory and practice. our examination of the gap as a generative metaphor led us to three clear paths forward, which we believe are relevant and actionable for hci researchers and practitioners. first, we argue for assessing existing proposed bridges, such as bridging concepts and the like, in order to determine whether and how they bring theory and practice closer together. second, relatedly, researchers and practitioners could build a library of successful bridges, such as affordances, and treat each as cases to be examined and shared. this will go a long way in showing to both groups what makes some theoretical constructs more valuable and useful to practitioners than others. third, inspired by the continuum metaphor, we believe it is crucial to frame practice as a kind of theorizing. dorst [12], for instance, has argued that the core of design thinking is in its reliance on abductive reasoning, which, given a desired outcome, allows the designer to arrive at the “best explanation.” such explanations by practitioners can, then, inform the thinking by researchers who can, in turn, develop them into theoretical constructs. consequently, a productive cycle of mutual support and synergy can emerge through the adoption of a new metaphor. derrida’s strategy of reversal and its application to the theory-practice relationship inspired us to propose and explore a different metaphor — that is, the metaphor of “continuum.” the new metaphor does not provide magical solutions to all problems, and the gap cannot be wished away, but it does allow us to think differently about the theory-practice relationship, addressing some issues and surpassing others.",617
Playing to Wait: A Taxonomy of Idle Games,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657322,"idle games are a recent minimalist gaming phenomenon in which the game is left running with little player interaction. we deepen understanding of idle games and their characteristics by developing a taxonomy and identifying game features. this paper examines 66 idle games using a grounded theory approach to analyze play, game mechanics, rewards, interactivity, progress rate, and user interface. to establish a clearly bounded definition of idle games, we analyzed 10 non-idle games with the same approach. we discuss how idle games move players from playing to planning, how they question dominant assumptions about gameplay, and their unusual use of resources such as player attention and computer cycles. our work illuminates opportunities for the design of idle games, suggests design implications, and provides a framework for researchers to clearly articulate questions about this genre. in this paper, we undertook a grounded theory study of idle games. we developed a taxonomy to point out several of the defining characteristics of these games. further, we discuss design implications for idle games, how they affect gameplay, game mechanics and interfaces that support playing to wait, and opportunities and challenges presented by this genre. our taxonomy contribution aims to support designers and the games community to make sense of the idle games phenomenon and helps to understand how it may be leveraged. designers can use the taxonomy as a guide to understand the game mechanics, types of gameplay, and design implications of each category of idle games, whether they are creating idle games or incorporating idle modes into games from other genres. researchers can use our framework to construct studies around game design and planning mechanics; our taxonomy also provides a common language for researchers and game designers to collaborate. finally, idle games may inspire new ways of thinking about what activities are valuable during play, how play should be organized, and what resources play demands, including both human resources, such as sustained attention, and environmental resources, such as power consumption.",618
Empowering Families Facing English Literacy Challenges to Jointly Engage in Computer Programming,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657323,"research suggests that parental engagement through joint media engagement (jme) is an important factor in children's learning for coding and programming. unfortunately, parents with limited technology background may have difficulty supporting their children's access to programming. english-language learning (ell) families from marginalized communities face particular challenges in understanding and supporting programming, as code is primarily authored using english text. we present blockstudio, a programming tool for empowering ell families to jointly engage in introductory coding, using an environment embodying two design principles, text-free and visually concrete. we share a case study involving three community centers serving immigrant and refugee populations. our findings show ell families can jointly engage in programming without text, via co-creation and flexible roles, and can create a range of artifacts, indicating understanding of aspects of programming within this environment. we conclude with implications for coding together in ell families and design ideas for text-free programming research. in this paper, we have presented two design principles (textfree, visually concrete), a system implementing them, and a case study showing jme among ell families learning to code using this system. our discussion shows varied possibilities for extending this new understanding of how coding environments may empower and support such underserved populations in learning to code together. we encourage the community to investigate making family-based programs more accessible to ell families, building text-free curriculum to teach coding at scale, supporting text-free program comprehension techniques, and finally, finding ways to support children as they transition from one coding environment to the next. our study focused on ell families, but they are not alone in facing difficulties with english text. neurodiverse people (e.g., those with dyslexia) experience challenges dealing with written text. the average reading ability of deaf children graduating high school is roughly at the third to fourth grade level [38]. thus, the removal of text from coding could be useful beyond ell populations. at the same time, it is not evident whether these same principles would be successful in empowering neurodiverse people to engage in coding, with or without family-based jme, providing another impactful avenue for future work. with these efforts, we can achieve more inclusive and diverse learning communities, and ultimately a more computing literate world.",619

Training Person-Specific Gaze Estimators from User Interactions with Multiple Devices,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657335,"learning-based gaze estimation has significant potential to enable attentive user interfaces and gaze-based interaction on the billions of camera-equipped handheld devices and ambient displays. while training accurate person- and device-independent gaze estimators remains challenging, person-specific training is feasible but requires tedious data collection for each target device. to address these limitations, we present the first method to train person-specific gaze estimators across multiple devices. at the core of our method is a single convolutional neural network with shared feature extraction layers and device-specific branches that we train from face images and corresponding on-screen gaze locations. detailed evaluations on a new dataset of interactions with five common devices (mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, smart tv) and three common applications (mobile game, text editing, media center) demonstrate the significant potential of cross-device training. we further explore training with gaze locations derived from natural interactions, such as mouse or touch input. in this work we proposed the first method for multi-device person-specific gaze estimation. our method leverages devicespecific encoders/decoders to adapt to device differences and uses shared feature extraction layers to encode the relation between personal facial appearance and gaze directions in a single representation shared across multiple devices. our experiments demonstrated that our multi-device cnn outperforms single-device baselines for five different target devices. furthermore, it could still improve the single-device cnn if it was trained with a sufficient amount of device-specific data. we also found that our method was more robust to noisy data than the single-device cnn. with the growing availability of camera-equipped devices, our method provides a practical and highly promising solution to personal gaze learning, thus opening up numerous opportunities for gaze-based applications in hci and affective/cognitive computing.",621
Designing for Diabetes Decision Support Systems with Fluid Contextual Reasoning,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657336,"type 1 diabetes is a potentially life-threatening chronic condition that requires frequent interactions with diverse data to inform treatment decisions. while mobile technologies such as blood glucose meters have long been an essential part of this process, designing interfaces that explicitly support decision-making remains challenging. dual-process models are a common approach to understanding such cognitive tasks. however, evidence from the first of two studies we present suggests that in demanding and complex situations, some individuals approach disease management in distinctive ways that do not seem to fit well within existing models. this finding motivated, and helped frame our second study, a survey (n=192) to investigate these behaviors in more detail. on the basis of the resulting analysis, we posit fluid contextual reasoning to explain how some people with diabetes respond to particular situations, and discuss how an extended framework might help inform the design of user interfaces for diabetes management. in this paper, we have shown evidence that many people with diabetes can make decisions with their complex data in a manner that does not easily conform with established cognitive models associated with habitual (type 1 analogous), or sensemaking (type 2 analogous) thinking. the former is largely reflexive, and therefore limited in its ability to exhibit variously: contextual consideration of complex multivariate data; hypothetical thinking as to potential events or outcomes; and awareness of highly variable situations. by contrast, the latter requires substantial cognitive effort, hence is ill suited to continual repeated application. while fcr is not necessarily a challenge to the fundamentals of two minds thinking, the behavior that we have evidenced does not readily match either. it appears conscious and engaged with complex scenarios, but there is not necessarily identification of a ‘gap’ situation, nor is there inherent discarding or formation of new models. ui designs based solely on a two minds theory have to choose between two extremes, thereby offering no clear guidelines for frequent engagement that retains critical and hypothetical thinking. the inclusion of fcr could allow for such a state. while earlier work [23] appears relevant, we are not aware of integration into current diabetes ui design. such an extension could help to provide a useful framework to analyze increasingly adopted tools such as cgm’s, and help suggest new designs. fcr does not invalidate the other modes, and we observed no cases where participants displayed fcr without displaying the other modes as well. fcr could be viewed as a workaround, to conserve cognitive resources, using models built up through sensemaking and experience. interestingly, it appears to be supported and fostered by emerging ubiquitous technologies, such as cgms. fcr, while not as prevalent as habitual and sensemaking, was found to be common among all demographics within our survey population. we suggest that all three modes are important tools for diabetes self-management, and greater care should be taken that uis for supporting self-management support these different modes within appropriate contexts. finally, we recognize that there is a significant body of research supporting dual-process theories, and it would be premature to challenge the perceived wisdom. however, there are more modest ways of viewing fcr mode as a useful cognitive workaround or adaption that allows individuals to accomplish domain specific requirements within the limitations of dual-process thinking. we have presented evidence that users appear to have found a way to integrate essential aspect of two recognized cognitive modes in order to interact with complex and hard to calculate data streams. this appears to allow them to weigh and make predictions on likely outcomes, and use those insights to make vital decisions, all in a fluid and frequent manner. we propose that support of such mental processes through medical uis merits further exploration. we suggest that possible relevance to other domains would also bear investigation.",622
"The Impact of Word, Multiple Word, and Sentence Input on Virtual Keyboard Decoding Performance",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657337,"entering text on non-desktop computing devices is often done via an onscreen virtual keyboard. input on such keyboards normally consists of a sequence of noisy tap events that specify some amount of text, most commonly a single word. but is single word-at-a-time entry the best choice? this paper compares user performance and recognition accuracy of word-at-a-time, phrase-at-a-time, and sentence-at-a-time text entry on a smartwatch keyboard. we evaluate the impact of differing amounts of input in both text copy and free composition tasks. we found providing input of an entire sentence significantly improved entry rates from 26 wpm to 32 wpm while keeping character error rates below 4%. in offline experiments with more processing power and memory, sentence input was recognized with a much lower 2.0% error rate. our findings suggest virtual keyboards can enhance performance by encouraging users to provide more input per recognition event. we explored how to improve text entry speed and recognition accuracy when using a virtual keyboard decoder. we focused on allowing users to change the quantity of observations provided to the decoder for each recognition event. compared to a word-at-a-time input strategy, providing input of an entire sentence significantly improved entry rates from 26 wpm to 32 wpm. this was done while keeping the character error rate below 4%. in offline recognition experiments, we found that with more processing power and memory, sentence input could be recognized with a 2.0% error rate while wordat-a-time input had a higher 2.8% error rate. our results suggest recognition-based touchscreen input methods can be designed to enhance performance by allowing users to modulate the amount of input per recognition event.",623

To Distort or Not to Distort: Distance Cartograms in the Wild,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657339,"distance cartograms (dc) distort geographical features so that the measured distance between a single location and any other location on a map indicates absolute travel time. although studies show that users can efficiently assess travel time with dc, distortion applied in dc may confuse users, and its usefulness ""in the wild"" is unknown. to understand how real world users perceive dc's benefits and drawbacks, we devise techniques that improve dc's presentation (preserving topological relationships among map features while aiming at retaining shapes) and scalability (presenting accurate live travel time). we developed a dc-enabled system with these techniques, and deployed it to 20 participants for 4 weeks. during this period, participants spent, on average, more than 50% of their time with dc as opposed to a standard map. participants felt dc to be intuitive and useful for assessing travel time. they indicated intent in adopting dc in their real-life scenarios. in this work, we devised novel techniques that enable development of a scalable system that presents dc. through the field study, we found benefits of using dc can outweigh its drawbacks in the wild, and dc can be adopted by real world users in various spatial exploration use cases. we also identified some features we presented in our system can be perceived as unintuitive. we anticipate that our work sets up the possibility for a deeper understanding of identifying more use cases of dc for different users, and developing dc’s distortion model may open new research opportunities.",625
Towards a Multisensory Augmented Reality Map for Blind and Low Vision People: a Participatory Design Approach,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657330,"current low-tech orientation & mobility (o&m) tools for visually impaired people, e.g. tactile maps, possess limitations. interactive accessible maps have been developed to overcome these. however, most of them are limited to exploration of existing maps, and have remained in laboratories. using a participatory design approach, we have worked closely with 15 visually impaired students and 3 o&m instructors over 6 months. we iteratively designed and developed an augmented reality map destined at use in o&m classes in special education centers. this prototype combines projection, audio output and use of tactile tokens, and thus allows both map exploration and construction by low vision and blind people. our user study demonstrated that all students were able to successfully use the prototype, and showed a high user satisfaction. a second phase with 22 international special education teachers allowed us to gain more qualitative insights. this work shows that augmented reality has potential for improving the access to education for visually impaired people. in this project, we designed a multisensory map for low vision and blind people. this prototype was based on a spatial augmented reality toolkit, originally designed for sighted people which we combined with audio feedback and existing tactile tools. our work has two major contributions. first, we improved the state of the art on accessible interactive maps for visually impaired students by designing a tool that enables both map exploration and map construction (whereas most prior prototypes are limited to exploration of existing maps). second, we rigorously applied a participatory design approach in close collaboration with students and professionals of a local special education center. this provides strong guarantees of usefulness and accessibility of our prototype. we believe that ultimately this work will contribute to improving the autonomy of visually impaired students.",626
Scaling Classroom IT Skill Tutoring: A Case Study from India,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657331,"india is home to the largest under-25 demographic profile in the world, but lacks a job-ready educational system. it requires a wide-spread, skill-oriented educational model, equipping youth to thrive in highly dynamic job markets. as a response to the huge demand for technical education, a large private skill-tutoring ecosystem has sprung up in in-dia but remains geographically limited. this paper, drawn from a three-month ethnographic research conducted in ameerpet (arguably india's largest it skilling hub), probes the pedagogic style and characteristics of tutoring, and of-fers reasons why learners prefer to enroll into a physical model of classroom teaching over online courses. we make design suggestions for online learning platforms to attract students who are marginalized in the more formal and com-petitive education system, and opt for ameerpet-like skill-hubs. our primary offering is to suggest a shift in perspec-tive of online education platforms to include job readiness and accompanying changes in course content and delivery. through a rich immersive ethnographic study, we attempted to offer learnings that sustain a large, physically located technical skill tutoring hub in hyderabad, india. our intent is to tease out implications that suggest a student preference for physical classroom situations to online mooc-like learning resources to acquire job-oriented it skill-tutoring; and knead these implications to offer design suggestions for online learning platforms that aim to target millions of students in india. we make design suggestions for online learning platforms to attract students who are marginalized in the more formal and competitive education system, and opt for ameerpet-like skill-hubs. our primary offering is to suggest a shift in perspective of online education platforms, to include job readiness and accompanying changes in course content and delivery, and point out directions for further work.",627
Regulating Feelings During Interpersonal Conflicts by Changing Voice Self-perception,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657332,"emotions play a major role in how interpersonal conflicts unfold. although several strategies and technological approaches have been proposed for emotion regulation, they often require conscious attention and effort. this often limits their efficacy in practice. in this paper, we propose a different approach inspired by self-perception theory: noticing that people are often reacting to the perception of their own behavior, we artificially change their perceptions to influence their emotions. we conducted two studies to evaluate the potential of this approach by automatically and subtly altering how people perceive their own voice. in one study, participants that received voice feedback with a calmer tone during relationship conflicts felt less anxious. in the other study, participants who listened to their own voices with a lower pitch during contentious debates felt more powerful. we discuss the implications of our findings and the opportunities for designing automatic and less perceptible emotion regulation systems. in this paper, we presented a subtle approach for regulating emotions during interpersonal conflicts, which consists in changing how people perceive their own voice. by leveraging theories and findings from emotion regulation, conflict management, nonverbal signals and self-perception, we conducted two studies focusing on interpersonal conflicts, in which participants received voice feedback through headphones with a specific emotional tone. in the first study, romantic couples had conversations about conflicts via skype, and we found that individuals who perceived their voice with a calmer tone felt less anxious and stressed. in the second study, participants who got involved in contentious debates felt more powerful when they heard their voices with a lower pitch. in both studies, participants were able to focus on their conversations without drifting their attention away to any emotion regulation technology, showing that the intervention does not require attention or effort to be effective. these findings offer promising opportunities for the design of technologies for emotion regulation.",628
Flotation Simulation in a Cable-driven Virtual Environment -- A Study with Parasailing,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657333,"this paper presents flotation simulation in a cable-driven virtual environment. for this, a virtual parasailing system was developed, where the visual stimulus was provided through a vr headset and the physical stimulus was given by wires. in order to prevent the user from moving out of the limited workspace of the cable-driven system, the visual acceleration was washout-filtered to produce the physical acceleration. in the parasailing trajectory, we focused on the stages of vertical acceleration/deceleration and conducted an experiment to identify how much gain can be applied to the visual acceleration, which makes the user feel the natural self-motion when integrated with physical stimulus. then, the results were tested using several types of full-course virtual parasailing. the results showed that fairly large differences between visual and physical stimuli would be accepted and different gains could be assigned depending on the user's altitudes. we presented virtual parasailing, where the visual stimulus is provided through a vr headset and the physical stimulus is given by a cable-driven system. in order to prevent the user from moving out of the limited workspace of the cabledriven system, the visual acceleration is washout-filtered to produce the physical acceleration. then, an experiment was conducted to identify how much gain can be applied to the visual acceleration, which makes the user feel the natural self-motion when integrated with the physical stimulus. the results were tested using several types of full-course virtual parasailing. the results showed that fairly large differences between visual and physical stimuli would be accepted and different gains could be assigned depending on the user’s altitudes. our research results can be applied to various instances of flotation simulation with jumping and free-fall motions. good candidates include skydiving and bungee jumping, where the dominant motions are made along the vertical direction. note that our cable-driven system can freely move the manned harness in any direction within the workspace. therefore, free-flying extreme sports such as paragliding and wingsuit flying could also be simulated with appropriate extensions of acceleration/deceleration controls for surge and sway motions. further investigations will be made for such extensions. our experiment also has limitations. a notable one is that no haptic stimulus was provided for the user’s feet. in the real-world parasailing, people first stand on the boat deck and then take off. in our experiment, however, the user started taking-off from the neutral position, i.e., from the state of being suspended in air. consequently, no haptic feedback was provided on the feet. it is well known that haptic cues have a huge impact on identifying visual gains [36]. if appropriate haptic feedback were provided for both taking-off and landing in our experiments, substantially different results would be obtained. integrating the haptic cue into the cable-driven system is an area of potential future work.",629
Identity Work as Deliberation: AAPI Political Discourse in the 2016 US Presidential Election,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657334,"asian americans and pacific islanders (aapis) are perceived as the ""model minority"" with a monolithic identity, in contrast to other marginalized racial groups in the united states. in reality, they are composed of different ethnicities, socio-economic backgrounds, and political ideologies. aapis share their political views online, engaging in the public sphere through a collaborative process we coin, ""identity work as deliberation."" using the 2016 us presidential election as a case study, we retrieved 4,406 reddit comments posted between october 2016 to december 2016. we examine how users engage in an online community through a deliberation lens to understand the extent to which reddit supports identity work as a deliberative process. under the collective aapi umbrella, we find that ethnic identifications complicate the types of discussion possible within r/asianamerican. we discuss how the expression of identity, and thereby solidarity, in a politicized online setting may lead to a social movement. we conceptualized reddit as a public space where people come together to engage in collaborative identity work as a public sphere through a process we call, “identity work as deliberation.” we situate our study during the 2016 us presidential election to capture a wide range of deliberation through which we can actively observe identity work and found that redditors engage in a multitude of strategies for maintaining values of inclusion, civility, and rationality. we analyze and discuss how the expression of identity, and thereby solidarity, in an online setting may shape collective action and lead to a social movement.",630
D-SWIME: A Design Space for Smartwatch Interaction Techniques Supporting Mobility and Encumbrance,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657345,"smartwatches enable rapid access to information anytime and anywhere. however, current smartwatch content navigation techniques, for panning and zooming, were directly adopted from those used on smartphones. these techniques are cumbersome when performed on small smartwatch screens and have not been evaluated for their support in mobility and encumbrance contexts (when the user's hands are busy). we studied the effect of mobility and encumbrance on common content navigation techniques and found a significant decrease in performance as the pace of mobility increases or when the user was encumbered with busy hands. based on these initial findings, we proposed a design space which would improve efficiency when navigation techniques, such as panning and zooming, are employed in mobility contexts. our results reveal that our design space can effectively be used to create novel interaction techniques that improve smartwatch content navigation in mobility and encumbrance contexts. smartwatches enable access to information on-the-go, anytime and anywhere. this can lead to scenarios in which users are mobile and/or encumbered. however, current navigation techniques for zooming and panning have been directly transposed from smartphone environments to smartwatch environments. our work investigates the impact of mobility and encumbrance on smartwatch interaction techniques. the first experiment revealed that standard interaction techniques are not resistant to different mobility contexts (standing, walking, and running) nor different encumbrance contexts (both hands available, non- dominant hand busy, and both hands busy). we hence proposed a design space dedicated to the design of smartwatch interaction techniques supporting mobility and encumbrance. our design space defines a structure based on the concept of on-touch efforts (while the fingers are in contact with the touch screen), and pre-touch efforts (while the fingers are preparing the next touch event). for the second experiment, we designed and evaluated two novel zooming techniques and two novel panning techniques in unexplored and theoretically promising areas revealed by our design space. we also proposed an adaptive version of each technique. results showed that: (i) our new techniques outperformed standard ones in all mobility and encumbrance contexts; and, (ii) reducing touch-efforts can reduce or cancel the negative impact of mobility and encumbrance. qualitative results also showed a clear preference for navigation techniques reducing touch-efforts. in this work, we evaluated one version of adaptive behavior for each technique. we based the scaling and panning rates on informal pilots. we plan to further study the effect of varying zooming and panning scales on each technique to better understand their influence on touch efforts. another extension of this work can be the exploration of the relationship between touch efforts, learning efforts (motor), and memory efforts (cognitive). such exploration could extend our 2-axes design space into a four dimensional one. due to the precision required for navigation tasks, eye-free interaction remains an open challenge. our work is a step toward the goal of optimal smartwatch interaction techniques by first reducing the motor requirements. future work can consider other factors, such as feedback, to improve eye-free input.",631
A Visual Interaction Framework for Dimensionality Reduction Based Data Exploration,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657346,"dimensionality reduction is a common method for analyzing and visualizing high-dimensional data. however, reasoning dynamically about the results of a dimensionality reduction is difficult. dimensionality-reduction algorithms use complex optimizations to reduce the number of dimensions of a dataset, but these new dimensions often lack a clear relation to the initial data dimensions, thus making them difficult to interpret. here we propose a visual interaction framework to improve dimensionality-reduction based exploratory data analysis. we introduce two interaction techniques, forward projection and backward projection, for dynamically reasoning about dimensionally reduced data. we also contribute two visualization techniques, prolines and feasibility maps, to facilitate the effective use of the proposed interactions. we apply our framework to pca and autoencoder-based dimensionality reductions. through data-exploration examples, we demonstrate how our visual interactions can improve the use of dimensionality reduction in exploratory data analysis. we propose a new visual interaction framework that lets users dynamically change the input and output of a dimensionality reduction (dr) and observe the effects of these changes. we achieve this framework through two new interactions, forward projection and backward projection, along with two new visualization techniques, prolines and feasibility map, that facilitate the effective use of the interactions. we apply our framework to principal component analysis (pca) and autoencoder-based drs and give examples demonstrating how our visual interactions can improve dr-based data exploration. we show that the framework interactions applied to pca and autoencoders provide a desirable balance between speed and accuracy to sustain interactivity, scaling gracefully with increasing data size and dimensionality. finally, we argue that our visual interaction framework can apply to black-box machine learning models at large and discuss how our framework subsumes recent approaches in visualizing deep neural network models. exploratory data analysis is an iterative process in which analysts essentially run mental experiments on data, asking questions and (re)forming and evaluating hypotheses. tukey and wilk [57] were among the first to observe the similarities between data analysis and doing experiments. of the eleven similarities between the two that they listed, one in particular is relevant here:“interaction, feedback, trial and error are all essential; convenience is dramatically helpful.” in fact, data can be severely underutilized (e.g., dead [24, 60]) without what-if analysis. however, to perform data analysis as if we were running data experiments, dynamic visual interactions that bidirectionally bind data and its visual representations must be among our tools. our work here is a contribution to performing visual analysis in a way similar to running experiments.",632
Complex Mediation in the Formation of Political Opinions,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657347,"the internet plays an important role in the formation of political opinions by supporting citizens in discovering diverse political information and opinions. however, the echo chamber effect has become of increasing concern, referring to the tendency for people to encounter opinions and information similar to their own online. it remains poorly understood how ordinary citizens use the internet in the formation of political opinions. to answer this question, we conducted an interview study with 32 chinese citizens. we found that participants used complex strategies to coordinate personal networks and technologies in specific ways to better understand political events. to analyze this phenomenon, we draw on bødker and andersen's model of complex mediation which describes how multiple mediators including people and artifacts work together to mediate an activity. we discuss how complex mediation supported participants in informing their political opinions. we derive design implications for supporting people to form political opinions. in this paper, we reported a qualitative study of how chinese citizens used personal social networks along with digital technologies to develop political opinions. we identified complex strategies, ranging from relying on one single medium to coordinating personal networks and technologies in a sophisticated way. we highlighted how the specific study context gave rise to the use of complex mediational strategies. through the case study, we demonstrated how complex mediation constituted a bottomup effort to manage the echo chamber effect. we discussed design implications in light of the socio-political and economic dimensions of the media environment.",633
NavigaTone: Seamlessly Embedding Navigation Cues in Mobile Music Listening,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657348,"as humans, we have the natural capability of localizing the origin of sounds. spatial audio rendering leverages this skill by applying special filters to recorded audio to create the impression that a sound emanates from a certain position in the physical space. a main application for spatial audio on mobile devices is to provide non-visual navigation cues. current systems require users to either listen to artificial beacon sounds, or the entire audio source (e.g., a song) is repositioned in space, which impacts the listening experience. we present navigatone, a system that takes advantage of multi-track recordings and provides directional cues by moving a single track in the auditory space. while minimizing the impact of the navigation component on the listening experience, a user study showed that participants could localize sources as good as with stereo panning while the listening experience was rated to be closer to common music listening. in this note we presented navigatone, a new approach to integrate navigation cues into everyday mobile music listening. instead of blocking the auditory channel for the single purpose of presenting an auditory beacon at the target location, we take advantage of multitrack recordings to reduce the impact of the navigation component on the listening experience. in combination with spatial audio rendering, we are able to indicate the direction of the navigation target by moving, e.g., the voice of the singer around the user’s head. in a lab study with 16 users, the results of this new approach were on par with the much simpler stereo-panning approach, but found our spatial display to be more natural and less cognitively demanding. although increased cognitive load under realistic circumstances might influence the perception, we believe that our approach can provide navigational cues in very different scenarios from pedestrian navigation to navigation in virtual worlds. as we were mostly interested in the ability to localize sources, we performed the lab experiment using a short loop of a vocal track that comes with the klang:app we used. to be able to work reliably with a multitude of songs, navigatone needs to ensure that the orientation cue is audible at the waypoints, i.e., the voice of the singer should be present at an intersection where the user needs to perform a left turn. if we look at the capabilities of modern dj software that allow us to create remixes on the fly, we can think of incorporating the navigation function even deeper into the playback mechanism. an intelligent algorithm could generate a remix of the original track adapted to the navigation task, with the samples used for localization shifted slightly from their original timing to make sure they are present when needed.",634
Considering Agency and Data Granularity in the Design of Visualization Tools,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657349,"previous research has identified trade-offs when it comes to designing visualization tools. while constructive ""bottom-up' tools promote a hands-on, user-driven design process that enables a deep understanding and control of the visual mapping, automated tools are more efficient and allow people to rapidly explore complex alternative designs, often at the cost of transparency. we investigate how to design visualization tools that support a user-driven, transparent design process while enabling efficiency and automation, through a series of design workshops that looked at how both visualization experts and novices approach this problem. participants produced a variety of solutions that range from example-based approaches expanding constructive visualization to solutions in which the visualization tool infers solutions on behalf of the designer, e.g., based on data attributes. on a higher level, these findings highlight agency and granularity as dimensions that can guide the design of visualization tools in this space. we have explored the design space of visualization tools that could combine the benefits of constructive, “bottom-up” visualization tools, namely transparency and active involvement in the visualization process, with those of “top-down” approaches, such as rapid visualization creation and applicability to large datasets. we analyzed solutions proposed by ourselves and a group of participants with a range of skill sets and levels of expertise in visualization. from this data we derived a catalog of solutions, a set of three design strategies (automated iteration, abstraction, and automated choices) and propose a conceptualization of the design space of visualization tools based on agency and granularity. finally, based on our analysis we provide a critical discussion of the existing landscape of tools, which we hope will help designers and the community consider better options in the design of visualization tools.",635

Voice Interfaces in Everyday Life,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657341,"voice user interfaces (vuis) are becoming ubiquitously available, being embedded both into everyday mobility via smartphones, and into the life of the home via 'assistant' devices. yet, exactly how users of such devices practically thread that use into their everyday social interactions remains underexplored. by collecting and studying audio data from month-long deployments of the amazon echo in participants' homes-informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis-our study documents the methodical practices of vui users, and how that use is accomplished in the complex social life of the home. data we present shows how the device is made accountable to and embedded into conversational settings like family dinners where various simultaneous activities are being achieved. we discuss how the vui is finely coordinated with the sequential organisation of talk. finally, we locate implications for the accountability of vui interaction, request and response design, and raise conceptual challenges to the notion of designing 'conversational' interfaces. the analysis presented here explicates how vui use is routinely accounted for and embedded in talk-ininteraction. by drawing on fragments from our corpus of recordings of amazon echo use collected from multiple homes, our findings reveal how the use of the echo is made ‘at home’, as situated actions, and becomes embedded in the life of the home rather than that of a discrete singular isolatable event. our data reveals that the incipience of interaction with a vui is achieved through its readyavailability, yet users may still methodically account for a request given the social context within which the use is done. we also unpacked the use of a vui as sequentially organised in and through talk in the home. ultimately, we identified two collaborative activities in using a vui: addressing the device in turns-at-talk, and dealing with responses from the device. finally, we turned to transferring our findings from that of matters of interaction to conceptual discussion points, to inform and shape future research and design on the use of vuis.",637
Mental Health Support and its Relationship to Linguistic Accommodation in Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657342,"many online communities cater to the critical and unmet needs of individuals challenged with mental illnesses. generally, communities engender characteristic linguistic practices, known as norms. conformance to these norms, or linguistic accommodation, encourages social approval and acceptance. this paper investigates whether linguistic accommodation impacts a specific social feedback: the support received by an individual in an online mental health community. we first quantitatively derive two measures for each post in these communities: 1) the linguistic accommodation it exhibits, and 2) the level of support it receives. thereafter, we build a statistical framework to examine the relationship between these measures. although the extent to which accommodation is associated with support varies, we find a positive link between the two, consistent across 55 reddit communities serving various psychological needs. we discuss how our work surfaces a tension in the functioning of these sensitive communities, and present design implications for improving their support provisioning mechanisms. in this paper, we presented a comprehensive study examining the relationship between linguistic accommodation and social support in online mental health communities. employing a large dataset of 55 reddit communities that focus on a variety of mental health topics, we first quantitatively derived measures for two kinds of social support, emotional and informational, as received by posts shared in these communities. then we measured linguistic accommodation exhibited in them, based on a psycholinguistic measure. our results showed that there is a significant positive association between linguistic accommodation and both the types of support, consistent across the communities we studied. based on these findings, we note a tension between the vitality of conformance to a community’s norms and the goals of support providers. our work bears implications for the design tools that can help improve online support provisioning mechanisms.",638
Value-Suppressing Uncertainty Palettes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657343,"understanding uncertainty is critical for many analytical tasks. one common approach is to encode data values and uncertainty values independently, using two visual variables. these resulting bivariate maps can be difficult to interpret, and interference between visual channels can reduce the discriminability of marks. to address this issue, we contribute value-suppressing uncertainty palettes (vsups). vsups allocate larger ranges of a visual channel to data when uncertainty is low, and smaller ranges when uncertainty is high. this non-uniform budgeting of the visual channels makes more economical use of the limited visual encoding space when uncertainty is low, and encourages more cautious decision-making when uncertainty is high. we demonstrate several examples of vsups, and present a crowdsourced evaluation showing that, compared to traditional bivariate maps, vsups encourage people to more heavily weight uncertainty information in decision-making tasks. uncertainty, data quality, or confidence values are often considered separately from the data itself, relegated to tooltips or visually distant supplemental charts. we contend, in contrast, that uncertainty information ought to be directly integrated within a shared chart. this integration introduces additional complexity in the design and presentation of data. valuesuppressing uncertainty palettes represent one strategy for dealing with this complexity, by assigning mark properties in a way that supports the disambiguation of values in data where uncertainty is low, but suppresses these judgments when uncertainty is high. this decision of how to allocate visual variables promotes patterns of decision-making that make responsible use of uncertainty information, discouraging comparison of values in unreliable regions of the data, and promoting comparison in regions of high certainty.",639

Haptic Links: Bimanual Haptics for Virtual Reality Using Variable Stiffness Actuation,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657455,"we present haptic links, electro-mechanically actuated physical connections capable of rendering variable stiffness between two commodity handheld virtual reality (vr) controllers. when attached, haptic links can dynamically alter the forces perceived between the user's hands to support the haptic rendering of a variety of two-handed objects and interactions. they can rigidly lock controllers in an arbitrary configuration, constrain specific degrees of freedom or directions of motion, and dynamically set stiffness along a continuous range. we demonstrate and compare three prototype haptic links: chain, layer-hinge, and ratchet-hinge. we then describe interaction techniques and scenarios leveraging the capabilities of each. our user evaluation results confirm that users can perceive many two-handed objects or interactions as more realistic with haptic links than with typical unlinked vr controllers. haptic links demonstrate the potential to improve the haptic rendering of two-handed objects and interactions in vr using inter-controller variable stiffness feedback. the multiple implementations of haptic links yield different capabilities and advantages for object rendering. our evaluation shows that haptic links can improve the perceived realism of two-handed objects without significantly detracting from the rendering of normal interactions requiring disjoint controllers. finally, the interaction techniques we introduce leverage haptic links to provide more compelling haptic experiences in vr. virtual reality has become increasingly immersive, leaving us with a growing need for authentic haptic interactions. haptic links offer designers of vr experiences a wide range of new haptic tools that work seamlessly with the handheld controllers of commodity vr systems. while our prototypes represent just a starting point in the design of future haptic links, we find their early success encouraging for the exploration of a new class of devices which can rapidly augment existing controllers to provide a customized haptic experience.",641
Breeze: Sharing Biofeedback through Wearable Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657456,"digitally presenting physiological signals as biofeedback to users raises awareness of both body and mind. this paper describes the effectiveness of conveying a physiological signal often overlooked for communication: breathing. we present the design and development of digital breathing patterns and their evaluation along three output modalities: visual, audio, and haptic. we also present breeze, a wearable pendant placed around the neck that measures breathing and sends biofeedback in real-time. we evaluated how the breathing patterns were interpreted in a fixed environment and gathered qualitative data on the wearable device's design. we found that participants intentionally modified their own breathing to match the biofeedback, as a technique for understanding the underlying emotion. our results describe how the features of the breathing patterns and the feedback modalities influenced participants' perception. we include guidelines and suggested use cases, such as breeze being used by loved ones to increase connectedness and empathy. we described breeze, a wearable device to communicate breathing biofeedback. breeze functions bidirectionally, by collecting data with physiological sensors and providing ambient biofeedback. to assess what information people can infer from the various feedback modalities that breeze provides (visual, audio, and haptic), we conducted a laboratory study where people rated the perceived emotions from a set of generated breathing patterns. to our knowledge our work is the first to describe, quantitatively (breathing measurement) and qualitatively (semistructured interviews), how people naturally mimic a foreign breathing pattern in order to understand it. we described a simple yet effective methodology for extracting interactions between breathing and perceived emotions, opening the use of breathing as a form of biofeedback. such findings may reinforce the bond that shared biofeedback can provide in remote communication. we envision that making physiological signals more visible could promote empathy and improve connectedness. our next step is to deploy this technology outside the laboratory in a long-term longitudinal study. we look forward to seeing how people will use breeze in their everyday lives to communicate with their loved ones.",642
eystrokes,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657457,"we report on typing behaviour and performance of 168,000 volunteers in an online study. the large dataset allows detailed statistical analyses of keystroking patterns, linking them to typing performance. besides reporting distributions and confirming some earlier findings, we report two new findings. first, letter pairs that are typed by different hands or fingers are more predictive of typing speed than, for example, letter repetitions. second, rollover-typing, wherein the next key is pressed before the previous one is released, is sur- prisingly prevalent. notwithstanding considerable variation in typing patterns, unsupervised clustering using normalised inter-key intervals reveals that most users can be divided into eight groups of typists that differ in performance, accuracy, hand and finger usage, and rollover. the code and dataset are released for scientific use. the findings have high-level implications in several areas of hci research. modelling assumptions behind the design of text entry methods must be updated, since they have been based on a view of typing styles as rather uniform. also, training should reconsider individuals’ ways of pressing keys. training procedures have been based mostly on the assumption of touch typing and ignored individual-specific ways of typing. exercises could explicitly train in rollover and be personalised for typists’ deficits in line with the cluster they belong to. we found that untrained typists can be as fast as trained typists, but trained typists in general are faster than untrained ones. it is possible that individualised training could help non-touch typists boost their performance. this implies that designers should be sensitive to the different ways people type – that is, design sensing pipelines and text entry techniques that enable rollover also on multitouch surfaces.",643
Selection-based Text Entry in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657458,"in recent years, virtual reality (vr) and 3d user interfaces (3dui) have seen a drastic increase in popularity, especially in terms of consumer-ready hardware and software. while the technology for input as well as output devices is market ready, only a few solutions for text input exist, and empirical knowledge about performance and user preferences is lacking. in this paper, we study text entry in vr by selecting characters on a virtual keyboard. we discuss the design space for assessing selection-based text entry in vr. then, we implement six methods that span different parts of the design space and evaluate their performance and user preferences. our results show that pointing using tracked hand-held controllers outperforms all other methods. other methods such as head pointing can be viable alternatives depending on available resources. we summarize our findings by formulating guidelines for choosing optimal virtual keyboard text entry methods in vr. in this paper, we have studied text entry in vr using a virtual keyboard and discussed the design space including criteria for assessing vr text entry methods. we have introduced six candidates that span different parts of the design space and evaluate their text entry performance and user preference. although the general conclusion is to choose controller pointing for text entry in vr, its usage is dependent on certain criteria and limitations (e.g. tracked hand-held controllers). in addition, isomorphic keyboard interaction, as in the freehand method, performed badly, even though it had promising user experience results. to sum up, and putting our findings together with related work and our design space, in this paper we present an example decision support tool in the form of a flowchart, so that the results can be easily used by future vr designers and researchers. text entry is an essential part of human computer interaction and there is still much research needed. design annotation (e.g. for 3d artists or architects), filename entry or parameter setting, and communication between users are just a few applications for text entry in vr. future vr systems (e.g. diaries, shops or social networks) may be designed to enable the user to stay in vr for longer times and therefore longer text entry needs to be feasible, too. finally, the qualifying techniques need to be evaluated in the context of interactive immersive virtual environments.",644
Effects of Viewing Multiple Viewpoint Videos on Metacognition of Collaborative Experiences,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657459,"this paper discusses the effects of multiple viewpoint videos for metacognition of experiences. we present a system for recording multiple users' collaborative experiences by wearable and environmental sensors, and another system for viewing multiple viewpoint videos automatically identified and extracted to associate to individual users. we designed an experiment to compare the metacognition of one's own experience between those based on memory and those supported by video viewing. the experimental results show that metacognitive descriptions related to one's own mind, such as feelings and preferences, are possible regardless whether a person is viewing videos, but such episodic descriptions as the content of someone's utterance and what s/he felt associated with it are strongly promoted by video viewing. we conducted another experiment where the same participants did identical metacognitive description tasks about half a year after the previous experiment. through the experiments, we found the first-person view video is mostly used for confirming the episodic facts immediately after the experience, whereas after half a year, even one's own experience is often felt like the experiences of others therefore the videos capturing themselves from the conversation partners and environment become important for thinking back to the situations where they were placed. this paper presented a system that abundantly records multiple viewpoint videos and automatically extracts scenes associated to individual user’s experiences and discussed the effects of viewing videos for reflecting and verbalizing experiences. to obtain concrete data for discussion, we conducted a metacognition experiment and compared the amount and the content of the metacognitive descriptions obtained using our system with ones that did not use it. our experimental results showed that our system is effective for reflecting on episodic memories related to the behaviors of oneself and others. we conclude that our system simplified recalling a scene’s situations where memories are gradually fading. many participants immersed themselves in the reexperience of their own recorded experiences with our system six months after the original experience. the necessity of such research is increasing in the modern society where continuous lifelog has become possible and the importance of understanding and talking about our experiences using videos of ourselves and others increase. the research results are thought to serve as design guidelines for the support system for memory assistance of elderly people and reflections of learners in the education field, for example. since an important characteristic of our system is the recording of identical scenes from multiple viewpoints, we should confirm the correlation between videos that the user actually watched and the metacognitive descriptions derived from them. we could not do such discussions since such additional equipment as an eye tracker is necessary to identify which video provided by the video viewer the user is watching. however, it is meaningful that participant comments argued that there was no significant advantage of multiple viewpoint videos immediately after the experience, but they claimed that they are useful for re-experiencing old experiences. detailed discussions are future work. discussion on how our system that supports recording/viewing videos (from multiple viewpoints) affects metacognition must be done based on whether it contributes to the development of the skills and the abilities of the perception. future work will investigate an experience-capturing system that can be used in various situations in daily life and evaluate it through long-term use.",645
"I Lead, You Help but Only with Enough Details: Understanding User Experience of Co-Creation with Artificial Intelligence",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657450,"recent advances in artificial intelligence (ai) have increased the opportunities for users to interact with the technology. now, users can even collaborate with ai in creative activities such as art. to understand the user experience in this new user--ai collaboration, we designed a prototype, duetdraw, an ai interface that allows users and the ai agent to draw pictures collaboratively. we conducted a user study employing both quantitative and qualitative methods. thirty participants performed a series of drawing tasks with the think-aloud method, followed by post-hoc surveys and interviews. our findings are as follows: (1) users were significantly more content with duetdraw when the tool gave detailed instructions. (2) while users always wanted to lead the task, they also wanted the ai to explain its intentions but only when the users wanted it to do so. (3) although users rated the ai relatively low in predictability, controllability, and comprehensibility, they enjoyed their interactions with it during the task. based on these findings, we discuss implications for user interfaces where users can collaborate with ai in creative works. this study examined the user experience of a user–ai collaboration interface for creative work, especially focusing on its communication and initiative issues. we designed a prototype, duetdraw, in which ai and users can draw pictures cooperatively, and conducted a user study using both quantitative and qualitative approaches. the results of the study revealed that during collaboration, users (1) are more content when ai provides detailed explanations but only when they want it to do so, (2) want to take the initiative at every moment of the process, and (3) have a fun and new user experience through interaction with ai. finally, based on these findings, we suggested design implications for user–ai collaboration interfaces for creative work. we hope that this work will serve as a step toward a richer and more inclusive understanding of interfaces in which users and ai collaborate in creative works.",646
Supporting Collaborative Health Tracking in the Hospital: Patients' Perspectives,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657451,"the hospital setting creates a high-stakes environment where patients' lives depend on accurate tracking of health data. despite recent work emphasizing the importance of patients' engagement in their own health care, less is known about how patients track their health and care in the hospital. through interviews and design probes, we investigated hospitalized patients' tracking activity and analyzed our results using the stage-based personal informatics model. we used this model to understand how to support the tracking needs of hospitalized patients at each stage. in this paper, we discuss hospitalized patients' needs for collaboratively tracking their health with their care team. we suggest future extensions of the stage-based model to accommodate collaborative tracking situations, such as hospitals, where data is collected, analyzed, and acted on by multiple people. our findings uncover new directions for hci research and highlight ways to support patients in tracking their care and improving patient safety. patients in the hospital want to keep track of their health, but lack the digital tools to collect, track, and reflect on all the data that is important to them. in this study, we investigated inpatient needs for tracking their health, and found that inpatients envision collaboratively tracking their health and care plan with their clinical team. we found their tracking process follows the stage-based model, but that collaborative tracking introduces new barriers to and requirements for successful tracking. we provided insights about designing collaborative tracking systems to help hospitalized patients manage their health and care, reflections on how collaborative tracking extends the stagebased model of personal informatics, and suggestions for new research directions. with better tools for collaborative tracking, patients in the hospital will be able to keep track of their health and care, increasing the potential for improved health outcomes and medical error prevention.",647
Investigating the Impact of Gender on Rank in Resume Search Engines,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657452,"in this work we investigate gender-based inequalities in the context of resume search engines, which are tools that allow recruiters to proactively search for candidates based on keywords and filters. if these ranking algorithms take demographic features into account (directly or indirectly), they may produce rankings that disadvantage some candidates. we collect search results from indeed, monster, and careerbuilder based on 35 job titles in 20 u. s. cities, resulting in data on 855k job candidates. using statistical tests, we examine whether these search engines produce rankings that exhibit two types of indirect discrimination: individual and group unfairness. furthermore, we use controlled experiments to show that these websites do not use inferred gender of candidates as explicit features in their ranking algorithms.",648
Cognitive Load Estimation in the Wild,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657453,"cognitive load has been shown, over hundreds of validated studies, to be an important variable for understanding human performance. however, establishing practical, non-contact approaches for automated estimation of cognitive load under real-world conditions is far from a solved problem. toward the goal of designing such a system, we propose two novel vision-based methods for cognitive load estimation, and evaluate them on a large-scale dataset collected under real-world driving conditions. cognitive load is defined by which of 3 levels of a validated reference task the observed subject was performing. on this 3-class problem, our best proposed method of using 3d convolutional neural networks achieves 86.1% accuracy at predicting task-induced cognitive load in a sample of 92 subjects from video alone. this work uses the driving context as a training and evaluation dataset, but the trained network is not constrained to the driving environment as it requires no calibration and makes no assumptions about the subject's visual appearance, activity, head pose, scale, and perspective. cognitive load estimation in the wild is an important and challenging problem. we propose two computer vision based approaches for addressing this problem. the first approach uses hmm models. the second approach uses a 3d-cnn model. both are based on temporal dynamics of the eye over a period of 6 seconds as captured by 90 visible light video frames. the hmm method tracks explicitly-extracted pupil positions over time, while the 3d-cnn method operates endto-end on the raw grayscale eye region image sequences. on a dataset of 92 subjects, the hmm approach achieves 77.7% average accuracy and the 3d-cnn approach achieves 86.1%.",649
The Effect of Offset Correction and Cursor on Mid-Air Pointing in Real and Virtual Environments,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657454,"pointing at remote objects to direct others' attention is a fundamental human ability. previous work explored methods for remote pointing to select targets. absolute pointing techniques that cast a ray from the user to a target are affected by humans' limited pointing accuracy. recent work suggests that accuracy can be improved by compensating systematic offsets between targets a user aims at and rays cast from the user to the target. in this paper, we investigate mid-air pointing in the real world and virtual reality. through a pointing study, we model the offsets to improve pointing accuracy and show that being in a virtual environment affects how users point at targets. in the second study, we validate the developed model and analyze the effect of compensating systematic offsets. we show that the provided model can significantly improve pointing accuracy when no cursor is provided. we further show that a cursor improves pointing accuracy but also increases the selection time. in this paper, we built mid-air pointing offset compensation models for real and virtual environments based on pointing gestures of 20 participants. we built models for four different ray casting techniques and used cross-validation (cv) to show that we achieve the smallest remaining offset when using eye-finger ray cast (efrc). in a second study, we further investigated efrc in a selection task. we confirm findings of previous work that using a cursor improves mid-air pointing precision. we show that the accuracy of mid-air pointing without a cursor can be improved through correction models for both real and virtual environments by 13.1%. further, we show that using a cursor a correction model can reduces the remaining pointing error by 4.5%. as the pointing accuracy may be affected by the hmd we envision as next step a study using hmds with a variety of fovs to understand the impact of a limited fov. in the presented paper we investigated real-world (rw) and virtual reality (vr) which are representing the edges of the milgram continuum [44], in the next steps, we will also investigate pointing in augmented reality (ar) and mixed reality.",650
"CLAW: A Multifunctional Handheld Haptic Controller for Grasping, Touching, and Triggering in Virtual Reality",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657465,"claw is a handheld virtual reality controller that augments the typical controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. our controller enables three distinct interactions (grasping virtual object, touching virtual surfaces, and triggering) and changes its corresponding haptic rendering by sensing the differences in the user's grasp. a servo motor coupled with a force sensor renders controllable forces to the index finger during grasping and touching. using position tracking, a voice coil actuator at the index fingertip generates vibrations for various textures synchronized with finger movement. claw also supports a haptic force feedback in the trigger mode when the user holds a gun. we describe the design considerations for claw and evaluate its performance through two user studies. the first study obtained qualitative user feedback on the naturalness, effectiveness, and comfort when using the device. the second study investigated the ease of the transition between grasping and touching when using our device. in this paper, we present the design of a novel haptic controller, named claw, that augments a typical vr handheld controller functionality with force feedback and actuated movement to the index finger. the primary design principle of our controller is to provide a multi-purpose controller that contains both the expected functionality of a vr controller (i.e., buttons, 6dof movement control, thumb joysticks, trigger) and enables a variety of force and tactile renderings for the most commonly expected hand interactions: grasping, touching, and triggering. we also contribute a way to switch between haptic modes, by sensing the differences in the user’s grasp as well as the situational context of the virtual scene. our user evaluations show that claw is highly effective in a variety of interactions with participants reporting high scores on realism, control, and manipulation ability, as well as low error rates when switching haptic modes. we hope that our claw controller inspires a new generation of vr handheld controllers that provide higher fidelity haptics (beyond vibro-tactile) on a single compact multi-purpose device.",651
Ripple Thermostat: Affecting the Emotional Experience through Interactive Force Feedback and Shape Change,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657466,"force feedback and shape change are modalities with a growing application potential beyond the more traditional guis. we present two studies that explored the effect of these modalities on the emotional experience when interacting with an intelligent thermostat. the first study compared visual feedback, force feedback, and a combination of force feedback and shape change. results indicate that force feedback correlates to experienced dominance during interaction, while shape change mainly affects experienced arousal. the second study explored how force feedback and shape change could communicate affective meaning during interaction with the thermostat through a co-design study. participants designed the thermostat behavior for three scenarios supporting energy savings. results suggest that despite their abstractness, force feedback and shape change convey affective meaning during the user-system dialogue. the findings contribute to the design of intelligible and intuitive feedback. in this paper, we presented two studies that explored the effect of haptic force feedback and shape change on the emotional experience. based on our findings, we suggest that haptic force feedback has a unique potential to coordinate control in a human-computer dialogue. shape change seems to be an eligible modality to provide affective meaning to the behavior of system that could make behavior of everyday intelligent objects more intuitive and intelligible.",652
A Qualitative Exploration of Perceptions of Algorithmic Fairness,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657467,"algorithmic systems increasingly shape information people are exposed to as well as influence decisions about employment, finances, and other opportunities. in some cases, algorithmic systems may be more or less favorable to certain groups or individuals, sparking substantial discussion of algorithmic fairness in public policy circles, academia, and the press. we broaden this discussion by exploring how members of potentially affected communities feel about algorithmic fairness. we conducted workshops and interviews with 44 participants from several populations traditionally marginalized by categories of race or class in the united states. while the concept of algorithmic fairness was largely unfamiliar, learning about algorithmic (un)fairness elicited negative feelings that connect to current national discussions about racial injustice and economic inequality. in addition to their concerns about potential harms to themselves and society, participants also indicated that algorithmic fairness (or lack thereof) could substantially affect their trust in a company or product. one way to make social change is to bolster pragmatic arguments for corporations to do good, by demonstrating that societally positive actions are also good business practice. consider for example how green to gold effectively argued that sustainable business practices not only benefit the environment but can yield significant financial profit [32]. in this paper, we presented a novel exploration of how traditionally marginalized populations perceive algorithmic fairness. while our findings can inform a range of stakeholders, we highlight the insight that company handling of algorithmic fairness interacts significantly with user trust. we hope this insight may provide additional motivation for companies across the technology sector to actively pursue algorithmic fairness. future work could fruitfully explore these findings with a broader population, noting that plane et al.’s study offers evidence that at least some of these issues may resonate widely [67]. we also suggest further exploring concrete actions that companies can take regarding algorithmic fairness, such as making specific improvements to product experiences, to build and maintain user trust. finally, we suggest further research on how stakeholders across the ecosystem can work collectively to leverage their different perspectives and skills to pursue algorithmic fairness.",653
The Benefits and Challenges of Video Calling for Emergency Situations,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657468,"in the coming years, emergency calling services in north america will begin to incorporate new modalities for reporting emergencies, including video-based calling. the challenge is that we know little of how video calling systems should be designed and what benefits or challenges video calling might bring. we conducted observations and contextual interviews within three emergency response call centres to investigate these points. we focused on the work practices of call takers and dispatchers. results show that video calls could provide valuable contextual information about a situation and help to overcome call taker challenges with information ambiguity, location, deceit, and communication issues. yet video calls have the potential to introduce issues around control, information overload, and privacy if systems are not designed well. these results point to the need to think about emergency video calling along a continuum of visual modalities ranging from audio calls accompanied with images or video clips to one-way video streams to two-way video streams where camera control and camera work need to be carefully designed. we believe that this work sets the scene for a rich research agenda. of course, this study has its limitations. currently many 9-1-1 centres in canada use the same card set for answering calls and assessing information. thus, despite the fact that we studied call centres in only one province of canada, it is likely that our findings around 9-1-1 work practices would be similar to other call centres in canada. given that we have not studied emergency call centres in other countries, it is unknown if our results generalize to them. however, our results on call taking procedures were similar to studies reported in other western countries, including the united states and the uk [4,35,45,56]. this suggests that work practices may be similar, though reactions to video calling and individual preferences may differ across the world. our work was specifically scoped to focus on the experiences of call takers and dispatchers, given the depth needed to understand this perspective. yet this does mean that we do not have data from actual callers that might show what their specific needs would be for video calls and what privacy concerns they might have. this suggests future studies aimed at a broad spectrum of callers, with varying backgrounds and experiences. future research should also explore the interactional exchanges between callers and call takers in more detail. a deeper comparison to remote troubleshooting work would also hold value. what we see as the key benefit of our work is the opening up of the design space around future emergency calls and call handling. while organizations continue to move to new solutions for emergency calls in canada and others countries, it is not the case that there is a narrow set of possibilities for such technologies. in fact, the design space is rich with possibilities and potential problems that will need to be addressed. we have looked at one specific angle and there are many more, including the specific needs of callers and first responders who receive the information dispatched by call centres. there is also much work to be done on exploring the design of video calling solutions and testing out the ideas that may stem from our research.",654
Whiskers: Exploring the Use of Ultrasonic Haptic Cues on the Face,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657469,"haptic cues are a valuable feedback mechanism for smart glasses. prior work has shown how they can support navigation, deliver notifications and cue targets. however, a focus on actuation technologies such as mechanical tactors or fans has restricted the scope of research to a small number of cues presented at fixed locations. to move beyond this limitation, we explore perception of in-air ultrasonic haptic cues on the face. we present two studies examining the fundamental properties of localization, duration and movement perception on three facial sites suitable for use with glasses: the cheek, the center of the forehead, and above the eyebrow. the center of the forehead led to optimal performance with a localization error of 3.77mm and accurate duration (80%) and movement perception (87%). we apply these findings in a study delivering eight different ultrasonic notifications and report mean recognition rates of up to 92.4% (peak: 98.6%). we close with design recommendations for ultrasonic haptic cues on the face. in summary, this paper proposed whiskers – high fidelity ultrasonic haptic cues to the face. it explores their feasibility across a wide range of cue parameters and in a practical notification task. the data demonstrates the fundamental viability of ultrasonic haptic cues on the face. this can both inform designers about how to best create such cues and also provide developers with practical targets for next generation wearable hardware that can produce them. in this way, this paper hopes to facilitate the integration of high fidelity ultrasonic non-contact haptic displays into next generation hmds.",655
Let's Play!: Digital and Analog Play between Preschoolers and Parents,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657460,"play is an enjoyable and developmentally useful part of early childhood, and parent-child play is a highly productive mechanism by which children learn to participate in the world. we conducted an observational lab study to examine how 15 parent-child pairs (children age 4-6) respond to and play with tablet apps as compared to analog toys. we found that parents and children were less likely to engage with each other or to respond to each other's bids for attention during play sessions with tab-lets versus play sessions with toys. we also observed that specific design features of tablet devices and children's apps-such as one-sided interfaces, game paradigms that demand continual attention, and lack of support for parallel interaction-are the primary mechanism shaping these differences. we provide guidance suggesting how children's apps might be re-designed to preserve the ad-vantages of digital play experiences while also evolving to build in the advantages of traditional toys. we presented the first study examining detailed observations of parents’ and children’s shared reactions to a variety of traditional toys and tablet apps. while children engaged eagerly with both kinds of stimuli, we observed that opportunities remain to make their favorite apps and games more inclusive of play partners and more conducive to shared parent-child experiences. we discussed suggestions on how children’s tablet apps might be re-designed to preserve the advantages of digital play experiences while also adopting the benefits of traditional toys.",656
Combating Attrition in Digital Self-Improvement Programs using Avatar Customization,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657461,"digital self-improvement programs (e.g., interventions, training programs, self-help apps) are widely accessible, but can not employ the same degree of external regulation as programs delivered in controlled environments. as a result, they suffer from high attrition -- even the best programs won't work if people don't use them. we propose that volitional engagement -- facilitated through avatar customization -- can help combat attrition. we asked 250 participants to engage daily for 3 weeks in a one-minute breathing exercise for anxiety reduction, using either a generic avatar or one that they customized. customizing an avatar resulted in significantly less attrition and more sustained engagement as measured through login counts. the problem of attrition affects self-improvement programs across a range of do-mains; we provide a subtle, versatile, and broadly-applicable solution. digital programs delivered at scale have the potential to increase access to support for people interested in selfimprovement in contexts as diverse as behaviour change, lifelong learning, and mental wellness. however, even the best-designed programs won’t work if people don’t use them. research in a variety of contexts has shown that digital programs that were effective in an rct are subject to high attrition when delivered in-the-wild, i.e., at scale. we present a general-purpose interaction technique for combating attrition – avatar customization – and show that it significantly improves retention over three weeks of a daily stress-relief intervention (a breathing exercise) over being assigned a generic avatar. given the broad accessibility and wide reach of programs delivered at scale, increasing adherence through interaction design has the potential to benefit a great number of people working at self-improvement.",657
"Use the Force Picker, Luke: Space-Efficient Value Input on Force-Sensitive Mobile Touchscreens",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657462,"picking values from long ordered lists, such as when setting a date or time, is a common task on smartphones. however, the system pickers and tables used for this require significant screen space for spinning and dragging, covering other information or pushing it off-screen. the force picker reduces this footprint by letting users increase and decrease values over a wide range using force touch for rate-based control. however, changing input direction this way is difficult. we propose three techniques to address this. with our best candidate, thumb-roll, the force picker lets untrained users achieve similar accuracy as a standard picker, albeit less quickly. shrinking it to a single table row, 20% of the ios picker height, slightly affects completion time, but not accuracy. intriguingly, after 70 minutes of training, users were significantly faster with this minimized thumb-roll picker compared to the standard picker, at the same accuracy and only 6% of the gesture footprint. we close with application examples. in this paper, we presented a way to reduce the screen real estate for picking values from long, ordered ranges on smartphones. while existing controls, like pickers or tables, require a significant amount of gesture footprint for dragging and spinning, we exploited the force sensors on modern smartphones to reduce the gesture footprint to the size of the thumb. we conducted three experiments to find a force-based technique that allows for bidirectional control of such a picker, while still fitting inside a standard table row. our first experiment identified thumb-roll, a technique that changes direction upon gently rolling the thumb to the left or right before applying force, as the fastest and most accurate technique to control a standard-sized picker by force input. although users were slower, accuracy was almost identical, and thumb-roll reduced the gesture footprint by 88%. we then showed that this allows the force picker to be shrunk down to a minimum size, without affecting accuracy, although it slightly slowed down untrained subjects. our final study showed that trained participants can actually be significantly faster using the minimized thumb-roll force picker than with a standard spin & drag picker, without significant loss of accuracy. with thumb-roll, these users needed only 6% of the gesture space required for dragging and spinning, and the minimized force picker takes up only 20% of the height of the ios 10 system picker. we provided application examples for value input on smartphones that benefit from the much smaller footprint and in-place touch interaction of the minimized thumb-roll force picker. we hope that our findings inspire other researchers and practitioners to further improve our key daily interactions with our smartphones through their force-sensing capabilities.",658
Live Sketch: Video-driven Dynamic Deformation of Static Drawings,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657463,"creating sketch animations using traditional tools requires special artistic skills, and is tedious even for trained professionals. to lower the barrier for creating sketch animations, we propose a new system, emphlive sketch,&lt;/i&gt; which allows novice users to interactively bring static drawings to life by applying deformation-based animation effects that are extracted from video examples. dynamic deformation is first extracted as a sparse set of moving control points from videos and then transferred to a static drawing. our system addresses a few major technical challenges, such as motion extraction from video, video-to-sketch alignment, and many-to-one motion-driven sketch animation. while each of the sub-problems could be difficult to solve fully automatically, we present reliable solutions by combining new computational algorithms with intuitive user interactions. our pilot study shows that our system allows both users with or without animation skills to easily add dynamic deformation to static drawings. we have presented a new interactive system for animating sketch drawings using video examples. the key idea is to extract object motion presented in the video using sparse point tracking, and transfer it to the sketch image using controlled mesh deformation. for motion extraction, we propose a new tracking method that is robust against occlusion and ambiguity, and further combines it with easy user controls for reliable tracking. for motion transfer, our system allows the user to fine control the animation using a set of interactive tools. we conducted a pilot study to show that given static sketches and the corresponding videos, non-professional users can turn them into vivid animations using the amount of time and efforts similar to that regard by the professional users. we believe our current work has only scratched the surface of an exciting opportunity. as pointed out earlier, our system still has problems in handling smooth image regions such as deforming clouds, or stochastic motions such as ocean waves, whose motion is hard to extract using automatic or interactive ways. expanding the system to handle more types of motions is desirable. the system currently can only transfer the raw motion extracted from videos, it would be interesting to use existing motion stylization or exaggeration approaches, such as the animation filter [45], to produce more lively motion trajectories by applying a simple filter. more stylizing animations may also be made by interactively applying motion amplifiers [28], elemental dynamics [50] to our animation results. in the future we would like to address the first subproblem as discussed in the introduction section by building a large set of videos with different motion properties and developing a retrieval method to find proper video examples given an arbitrary sketch as input.",659
ECGLens: Interactive Visual Exploration of Large Scale ECG Data for Arrhythmia Detection,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657464,"the electrocardiogram (ecg) is commonly used to detect arrhythmias. traditionally, a single ecg observation is used for diagnosis, making it difficult to detect irregular arrhythmias. recent technology developments, however, have made it cost-effective to collect large amounts of raw ecg data over time. this promises to improve diagnosis accuracy, but the large data volume presents new challenges for cardiologists. this paper introduces ecglens, an interactive system for arrhythmia detection and analysis using large-scale ecg data. our system integrates an automatic heartbeat classification algorithm based on convolutional neural network, an outlier detection algorithm, and a set of rich interaction techniques. we also introduce a-glyph, a novel glyph designed to improve the readability and comparison of ecg signals. we report results from a comprehensive user study showing that a-glyph improves the efficiency in arrhythmia detection, and demonstrate the effectiveness of ecglens in arrhythmia detection through two expert interviews. we have presented an interactive data exploration system, ecglens, that enables cardiologists to visually identify and analyze arrhythmia in large-scale ecg records. the system design supports the exploration process by integrating a heartbeat classification algorithm, an outlier detection algorithm to our system, as well as an interactive workflow for arrhythmia detection. the design includes the novel a-glyph representation for ecg data which we show outperforms baseline designs in identifying heartbeats that exhibit arrhythmia. moreover, our evaluation shows that the overall system successfully supported arrhythmia identification within large-scale ecg datasets. in the future, we plan on addressing the limitations of our current implementation and deploying our system to local hospitals so as to improve our system through more users’ feedback. moreover, we intend to improve our classification algorithm by feeding clinician-provided corrections back to a model re-training process in real-time.",660
"""Protection on that Erection?"": Discourses of Accountability & Compromising Participation in Digital Sexual Health",https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657475,"this paper analyses sexual health workers' 'talk' around their introduction of a digital platform to enhance a regionally managed condom distribution scheme for young people. in examining the discursive resources workers used in framing the sexual health service, their service users and digital technology, we argue that problematic ideologies around young people and sexuality were exercised and reproduced. workers positioned themselves as the gatekeepers of young people's sexual health, who were in turn constructed as 'mischievous' and 'misguided', with technology having a corruptive role over what was considered to be 'healthy' and 'normal' sexual relationships. we suggest our findings indicate severe challenges in developing community-commissioned platforms alongside service providers, and questions how plausible user participation can be in attempting to conduct collaborative, participatory and engaged work in this context. this paper has examined the discursive resources sexual health workers used in framing a digital application to support their young people’s condom distribution scheme. we argue that, in framing users as potential deviants, we were unable to retain values of user-centred design, participation, and community approaches to sexual health in conducting applied, collaborative research. our research highlights a number of tensions around how sexual health services are positioned by sexual health workers, and how, subsequently, the role of digital technology was problematised. nevertheless, we suggest there are opportunities to challenge traditional approaches of sexual health through introducing digital elements into service provision. although workers’ constructions of technology were at times questionable, digital approaches held discursive impact for our participants, particularly when they were seen to be supporting the agenda of running an efficient service. mindful of how these services are situated within the broader socio-economic circumstances, these topdown approaches pose considerable challenges to usercentred participation. a discursive approach to analysis facilitated a nuanced consideration around the complexities of this setting, and we suggest that dp holds great opportunity in analysing applied hci work, particularly when use cases indicate contradiction, problematic assumptions, or power dynamics.",661
Fast & Furious: Detecting Stress with a Car Steering Wheel,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657476,"stress affects the lives of millions of people every day. in-situ sensing could enable just-in-time stress management interventions. we present the first work to detect stress using the movements of a car's existing steering wheel. we extend prior work on pc peripherals and demonstrate that stress, expressed through muscle tension in the limbs, can be measured through the way we drive a car. we collected data in a driving simulator under controlled circumstances to vary the levels of induced stress, within subjects. we analyze angular displacement data to estimate coefficients related to muscle tension using an inverse filtering technique. we prove that the damped frequency of a mass spring damper model representing the arm is significantly higher during stress. stress can be detected with only a few turns during driving. we validate these measures against a known stressor and calibrate our sensor against known stress measurements. in this paper, we have introduced a simple yet effective way to measure mental stress using only the steering wheel of an automobile. we have shown the efficacy of using a simple mass spring damper (msd) model to detect the stress affecting the muscles of the arm. we calibrated our sensing algorithm against well known stress measurements such as self-reports, heart rate variability (rmssd), and electrodermal activity (eda). to validate our model, we have compared the damping frequency of the msd system with well known math and music stressors. using this model, we have found that it is possible to detect viable signals of stress with only a few turns, and that our sensor can capture longer term effects of stress expressed through muscle tension. this is the first work of this type, opening up new opportunities to use devices already embedded in a car as in-situ non-obtrusive stress sensors.",662
Norms Matter: Contrasting Social Support Around Behavior Change in Online Weight Loss Communities,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657477,"online health communities (ohcs) provide support across conditions; for weight loss, ohcs offer support to foster positive behavior change. however, weight loss behaviors can also be subverted on ohcs to promote disordered eating practices. using comments as proxies for support, we use computational linguistic methods to juxtapose similarities and differences in two reddit weight loss communities, r/proed and r/loseit. we employ language modeling and find that word use in both communities is largely similar. then, by building a word embedding model, specifically a deep neural network on comment words, we contrast the context of word use and find differences that imply different behavior change goals in these ohcs. finally, these content and context norms predict whether a comment comes from r/proed or r/loseit. we show that norms matter in understanding how different ohcs provision support to promote behavior change and discuss the implications for design and moderation of ohcs. in this paper, we proposed a computational approach to understand norms of social support around behavior change for two weight loss communities, r/loseit and r/proed. we analyzed the comments in the communities using language models, and found that the tokens they use were surprisingly similar. then, we explored the context of use of these tokens in the comments of the two communities with word embedding models, and observed that the context of word use implied substantially different support practices. finally, we developed and evaluated logistic regression classifiers to identity the community a comment comes from, thereby distinguishing between healthy and subversive support behaviors. overall, we found that norms of support in these two communities facilitated healthy as well as subversive behavior change around weight loss. our work suggests strategies and solutions with our methods and insights toward improving online health communities.",663
“A Stalker's Paradise”: How Intimate Partner Abusers Exploit Technology,https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N657478,"this paper describes a qualitative study with 89 participants that details how abusers in intimate partner violence (ipv) contexts exploit technologies to intimidate, threaten, monitor, impersonate, harass, or otherwise harm their victims. we show that, at their core, many of the attacks in ipv contexts are technologically unsophisticated from the perspective of a security practitioner or researcher. for example, they are often carried out by a ui-bound adversary - an adversarial but authenticated user that interacts with a victim»s device or account via standard user interfaces - or by downloading and installing a ready-made application that enables spying on a victim. nevertheless, we show how the sociotechnical and relational factors that characterize ipv make such attacks both extremely damaging to victims and challenging to counteract, in part because they undermine the predominant threat models under which systems have been designed. we discuss the nature of these new ipv threat models and outline opportunities for hci research and design to mitigate these attacks. this paper discusses how intimate partner abusers exploit technologies to intimidate, threaten, monitor, impersonate, harass, or otherwise harm their victims. we show that many prevalent attacks in ipv may be easily carried out by average technology users because traditional threat models are often undermined by the ipv context. our analysis suggests that one important threat model in this setting is characterized by ui-bound adversaries, authenticated but adversarial users that interact with a system via the regular ui. we provide constructive ideas for how to deal with ui-bound and other adversaries via ipv design reviews and better tools for detecting applications used to spy on victims. taken together, our findings set the stage for future research and improvements to ipv safety.",664
A Translational Science Model for HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300231,"using scientific discoveries to inform design practice is an important, but difficult, objective in hci. in this paper, we provide an overview of translational science in hci by triangulating literature related to the research-practice gap with interview data from many parties engaged (or not) in translating hci knowledge. we propose a model for translational science in hci based on the concept of a continuum to describe how knowledge progresses (or stalls) through multiple steps and translations until it can influence design practice. the model offers a conceptual framework that can be used by researchers and practitioners to visualize and describe the progression of hci knowledge through a sequence of translations. additionally, the model may facilitate a precise identification of translational barriers, which allows devising more effective strategies to increase the use of scientific findings in design practice. the presence of barriers that hamper the progression of knowledge into design practice is a significant issue within hci. therefore, it is necessary to understand how knowledge progresses, or fails to progress, from research to practice. to design the model for translational science in hci, we drew on past work and interview data with researchers, practitioners, and multiple parties who are engaged – or not — in translating hci knowledge. in our continuum, we describe multiple steps and gaps between basic and applied research, and design practice. we also identify multiple translators and the translational work they do. this model offers insights on how to bridge translational gaps and how to work with and train translators effectively. it also acts as a foundation for future research on translational science in hci.",665

Human-Centered Tools for Coping with Imperfect Algorithms During Medical Decision-Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300234,"machine learning (ml) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. one application of ml is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. however, no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. in this paper, we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm, and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly, communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. in two evaluations with pathologists, we found that these tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. the tools were preferred over a traditional interface, without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. we also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools, re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ml errors from their own errors. taken together, these findings inform future human-ml collaborative systems for expert decision-making. in this paper, we found that refinement tools not only increased trust and utility, but were also used for critical decisionmaking purposes beyond guiding an algorithm. our work brings to light the dual challenges and opportunities of ml: although black-box ml algorithms can be difficult to understand, off-the-shelf image embeddings from dnns could enable new, lightweight ways of creating interactive refinement and exploration mechanisms. ultimately, refinement tools gave doctors the agency to hypothesis-test and apply their domain knowledge, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of automation. taken together, this work provides implications for how ml-based systems can augment, rather than replace, expert intelligence during critical decision-making, an area that will likely continue to rise in importance in the coming years.",668
Seeing with New Eyes: Designing for In-the-Wild Museum Gifting,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300235,"this paper presents the gift smartphone app, an artist-led research through design project benefitting from a three-day in-the-wild deployment. the app takes as its premise the generative potential of combining the contexts of gifting and museum visits. visitors explore the museum, searching for objects that would most appeal to the gift-receiver they have in mind, then photographing those objects and adding audio messages for their receivers describing the motivation for their choices. this paper charts the designers' key aim of creating a new frame of mind using voice, and the most striking findings discovered during in-the-wild deployment in a museum -- 'seeing with new eyes' and fostering personal connections. we discuss empathy, motivation, and bottom-up personalisation in the productive space revealed by this combination of contexts. we suggest that this work reveals opportunities for designers of gifting services as well as those working in cultural heritage. blast theory’s arts-based app for gifting experiences within museums juxtaposed two very different sets of practices and expectations. personal memories and connections were evoked in a public space. participants created and/or received digital gifts made of photos of museum objects taken from anywhere within the physical collection, combined with spoken explanations of their choices, clues of where to find the gifts, messages, and a song. blast theory’s design decisions resulted in some confirmations of their hunches and some surprises. however, many participants shared the sentiments of p47: ‘i think it was definitely an interesting way to look at the museum through fresh eyes. and i have been to this museum a lot, over, yes, 27 years, so having a new way to look at it and interact with it was really interesting’. coming from a research through design perspective and benefitting from qualitative feedback from 114 participants, this work can be the starting point for coming to understand arts-based design for gifting activities in mixed contexts: in this case, museum-situated digital gifting practices. we have drawn implications around empathy, motivation, and bottom-up personalisation for design researchers, makers of gifting services, and museum professionals, respectively. the gift app raises ideas for future work. perhaps most pressing for museum professionals is concern over the need for front of house staff to support visitors in overcoming the nervousness that some felt in participating in an unknown type of experience in a public place. blast theory knew that this would be a challenge, and the deployment highlighted the extent and specifics of that challenge. we acknowledge these difficulties, but we also see potential advantages in building relationships with visitors seen as relational beings who bring their most treasured memories and relationships with them wherever they go. museums can build on these powerful relationships and possibly discover ways unique to each institution of fostering personal engagement. we also see potential in experimenting with new means of encouraging receivers to come to the museum to receive their gifts, or of using gifting as a way to frame engagement with a museum’s digital collection or virtual presence, even for visitors who may never see the museum in person. if this app is scaled up as blast theory hopes it may be, the gift app and other arts-led interventions may ‘change the context in which they operate’ [26, p. 943] and help shape the continuing re-evaluation of the purpose of museums in societies where digital interactions are increasingly the norm and where museums are expected to do ever more outreach with ever fewer resources, year upon year.",669

"Connect-to-Connected Worlds: Piloting a Mobile, Data-Driven Reflection Tool for an Open-Ended Simulation at a Museum",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300237,"immersive open-ended museum exhibits promote ludic engagement and can be a powerful draw for visitors, but these qualities may also make learning more challenging. we describe our efforts to help visitors engage more deeply with an interactive exhibit's content by giving them access to visualizations of data skimmed from their use of the exhibit. we report on the motivations and challenges in designing this reflective tool, which positions visitors as a ""human in the loop"" to understand and manage their engagement with the exhibit. we used an iterative design process and qualitative methods to explore how and if visitors could (1) access and (2) comprehend the data visualizations, (3) reflect on their prior engagement with the exhibit, (4)plan their future engagement with the exhibit, and (5) act on their plans. we further discuss the essential design challenges and the opportunities made possible for visitors through data-driven reflection tools. recorded data of visitor actions could, possibly, serve as a “prosthetic memory” for activities in which visitors were deeply and ludically engaged, helping visitors meld their experiential memories with extra information provided by the logs to support a deeper understanding. in museum contexts, there is an increasing number of digital exhibits which are generating interesting usage data which could promote reflection, but giving visitors feedback in this way is in its infancy. this work shows that data-driven feedback can influence the “stories visitors tell themselves” about an exhibit experience, which is hugely important: the way visitors construct narratives about their museum experiences is known to be a powerful learning mechanism in museums [15, 38], as both conversation and narrative strategies are fundamentally sense-making behaviors [14]. data-driven feedback helped participants in the feedback session develop a ""to each according to their needs"" story about their use of connected worlds, a story that made direct use of the variables we provided them, and a story that required the consideration of more information than the simpler ""share and share alike"" story participants generated in the non-feedback session. expanding beyond our context, the story-framing consequences of data selection and presentation are a big design consideration for formative feedback in open-ended learning settings, and thus could benefit from a more formal consideration of narrative and narrative structures and how they could impact data-driven feedback design. for example, different data subsets or visualizations may or may not support different “plot” structures (mysteries, tales of redemption, etc.). hci researchers have begun codifying narrative design patterns for presenting data in graphical stories [2], and how interactive technology can advance narratives in the form of interactive theater [4, 24, 43]; such work may have useful suggestions for engineering narratives with data-driven feedback. a key feature of narratives is that they are inherently sequential - although a story may be told nonlinearly, or begin in media res, the order in which the components of the narrative are revealed is a major part of how it is received by the audience. this concept resonates with the design tension we uncovered concerning when to deliver data-driven feedback to visitors. in prior work, feedback delivered too early could derail visitor engagement [21], the equivalent of reading the last page of a mystery story first. in another exhibit, despite being given “just-in-time” automated alerts that suggested that the moment was right to deliver content, mediators often found the visitors unreceptive [45], demonstrating that a “teachable moment” may not be the same as a “learnable moment” [23]. if just-in-time feedback can be accessed on-demand, when both needed and desired by learners, it might ultimately be better for supporting learning than retrospective reflection - schön points out that in contrast to “reflection-on-action,” “reflection-in-action” yields widerranging learning benefits, which more directly improve people’s ability to perform situated tasks [40]. baumer [5] likens “retrospective reflection” to “slow technology,” adopting the analogy from the distinction between gourmet and fast food. we argue that while some forms of just-in-time feedback may be as “unhealthy” for learning as a carton of fries, the use of a narrative framing to select which data to present, and when, may be the equivalent of “chewing slowly.”",671

To Asymmetry and Beyond!: Improving Social Connectedness by Increasing Designed Interdependence in Cooperative Play,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300239,"social play can have numerous health benefits but research has shown that not all multiplayer games are effective at promoting social engagement. asymmetric cooperative games have shown promise in this regard but the design and dynamics of this unique style of play is not yet well understood. to address this, we present the results of two player experience studies using our custom prototype game beam me 'round, scotty! 2: the first comparing symmetric cooperative play (e.g., where players have the same interface, goals, mechanics, etc.) to asymmetric cooperative play (e.g., where players have differing roles, abilities, interfaces, etc.) and the second comparing the effect of increasing degrees of interdependence between play partners. our results not only indicate that asymmetric cooperative games may enhance players' perceptions of connectedness, social engagement, immersion, and comfort with a game's controls, but also demonstrate how to further improve these outcomes via deliberate mechanical design changes, such as changes in cooperative action timing and direction of dependence. in this paper, we present the findings of a pair of player experience studies that compared asymmetric play to symmetric play, and within asymmetric play, the degrees of designed interdependence.we found that social presence and perceptions of connectedness were higher in asymmetric play than symmetric play, and higher in tightly-coupled asymmetric play than loosely-coupled asymmetric play. these same trends were also found for immersion, behavioural engagement, and even understanding and comfort with the game’s controls. we also reflect on several themes that emerged, including the need for designers to consider both emergent cooperation vs. designed interdependence as well as whether, how, and when to provide flexibility in the degree of interdependence.",673
DesignABILITY: Framework for the Design of Accessible Interactive Tools to Support Teaching to Children with Disabilities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300240,"developing educational tools aimed at children with disabilities is a challenging process for designers and developers because existing methodologies or frameworks do not provide any pedagogical information and/or do not take into account the particular needs of users with some type of impairment. in this study, we propose a framework for the design of tools to support teaching to children with disabilities. the framework provides the necessary stages for the development of tools (hardware-based or software-based) and must be adapted for a specific disability and educational goal. for this study, the framework was adapted to support literacy teaching and contributes to the design of educational/interactive technology for deaf people while making them part of the design process and taking into account their particular needs. the experts' evaluation of the framework shows that it is well structured and may be adapted for other types of disabilities. the proposed framework makes it easy to break down the activities of every stage and adapt it to other types of disabilities and learning goals/strategies. the adaptation made in this study to support literacy teaching to deaf children shows that the designability framework is not a general-purpose framework, instead, it is a modular approach that can be transformed according to the final users’ needs. a first evaluation of the framework is shown in this paper, 26 researchers from different fields (hci, design, software development) took the survey and the results demonstrate how promising this proposal is for addressing accessibility in the development of educational tools. all the recommendations given by the researchers will be taken into account for the improvement of the framework. for the adaptation of the framework (deaf+literacy), the “design for engaged learning” stage proposes a storytelling and collaborative learning approach which could support literacy teaching to deaf children by engaging children into learning through stories, teamwork and technology. the words storytelling and collaboration, when used in the same context, promise to provide social, creative and fun aspects of learning [51]. during the review of the literature on storytelling [13] and collaborative learning (cl) [8] to support literacy teaching, we found that there is a lack of research regarding the use of these two strategies for the education of deaf children. fortunately, the results of the studies that made use of any of these strategies on developing reading and writing skills, show the effectiveness of using technology with one or both approaches [10][11][12] [14] [41][52]. two prototypes are under development following the stages of the designability framework adapted for literacy teaching to deaf children. these prototypes will be tested by deaf children in institutions from colombia and scotland. the process is being supported by teachers of deaf pupils in both countries with high expectations from educators. the new framework proposed in this study, and its adaptation for literacy, contributes to the design of educational/interactive technology for deaf people while making them part of the design process and taking into account their particular needs. this enables a better application of technology to education and consequently a better learning experience. the adaptation of the framework also gives specific details on how to structure collaborative learning and storytelling activities with/for deaf children during the design of an educational tool, which is not found in current hci literature. finally, our proposal suggests principles for experts’ reviews to evaluate cl and also the tool aimed at deaf children (some of these principles are the result of our previous work with deaf children). specific evaluation methods that can be used with deaf children are suggested to evaluate the ux of the designed tool. for future work, the designability framework will be adapted to support teaching to children with other disabilities like blindness, autism or with cognitive impairments.",674
Transcalibur: A Weight Shifting Virtual Reality Controller for 2D Shape Rendering based on Computational Perception Model,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300241,"humans can estimate the shape of a wielded object through the illusory feeling of the mass properties of the object obtained using their hands. even though the shape of hand-held objects influences immersion and realism in virtual reality (vr), it is difficult to design vr controllers for rendering desired shapes according to the perceptions derived from the illusory effects of mass properties and shape perception. we propose transcalibur, which is a hand-held vr controller that can render a 2d shape by changing its mass properties on a 2d planar area. we built a computational perception model using a data-driven approach from the collected data pairs of mass properties and perceived shapes. this enables transcalibur to easily and effectively provide convincing shape perception based on complex illusory effects. our user study showed that the system succeeded in providing the perception of various desired shapes in a virtual environment. in this paper, we introduced transcalibur: the weight moving vr controller for 2d haptic shape illusion. we implemented a hardware prototype, which can change its mass property in 2d planar space, and applied data-driven methods to obtain maps between mass property and perceived shape. based on the demonstration and experiment, we succeeded in rendering various shape perceptions through the controller based on pre-computed perception model. as a future work, we further investigate details on time factor of shape changing in vr, and we aim to develop a simpler design and yet maximizes range of rendering shape.",675
LightBee: A Self-Levitating Light Field Display for Hologrammatic Telepresence,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300242,"lightbee is a novel ""hologrammatic"" telepresence system featuring a self-levitating light field display. it consists of a drone that flies a projection of a remote user's head through 3d space. the movements of the drone are controlled by the remote user's head movements, offering unique support for non-verbal cues, especially physical proxemics. the light field display is created by a retro-reflective sheet that is mounted on the cylindrical quadcopter. 45 smart projectors, one per 1.3 degrees, are mounted in a ring, each projecting a video stream rendered from a unique perspective onto the retroreflector. this creates a light field that naturally provides motion parallax and stereoscopy without requiring any headset nor stereo glasses. lightbee allows multiple local users to experience their own unique and correct perspective of the remote user's head. the system is currently one-directional: 2 small cameras mounted on the drone allow the remote user to observe the local scene. we presented lightbee, a hologrammatic self-levitating telepresence drone that conveys a 3d image of the remote participant’s head via a cylindrical light field display. te light field display consists of a retroreflective screen mounted on a cylindrical quadcopter. tis screen is projected on by a circular array of 45 projectors mounted above the heads of local interlocutors. each projector has its own renderer that, in parallel, calculates a viewport from a 3d relief map captured at the remote location. tis capture system comprises an array of visible light stereo cameras connected to a pc. te remote user’s head movement is tracked and transmited to control the location of the drone. our light field display provides continuous motion parallax and stereoscopy to multiple local interlocutors without any need for head-worn apparatus. it allows correct horizontal gaze awareness between local and remote participants. moreover, the movement of the display provides the remote user with the ability to explore the local environment, even when not projected upon. we discussed results from initial evaluations with users indicating that the telepresence system could support interactions between remote users, and concluded with initial insights into areas of improvement.",676
TabletInVR: Exploring the Design Space for Using a Multi-Touch Tablet in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300243,"complex virtual reality (vr) tasks, like 3d solid modelling, are challenging with standard input controllers. we propose exploiting the affordances and input capabilities when using a 3d-tracked multi-touch tablet in an immersive vr environment. observations gained during semi-structured interviews with general users, and those experienced with 3d software, are used to define a set of design dimensions and guidelines. these are used to develop a vocabulary of interaction techniques to demonstrate how a tablet's precise touch input capability, physical shape, metaphorical associations, and natural compatibility with barehand mid-air input can be used in vr. for example, transforming objects with touch input, ""cutting"" objects by using the tablet as a physical ""knife"", navigating in 3d by using the tablet as a viewport, and triggering commands by interleaving bare-hand input around the tablet. key aspects of the vocabulary are evaluated with users, with results validating the approach. we are the first to investigate the design of an example interaction vocabulary for using a multi-touch tablet in vr for 3d solid modeling. we approach the design methodically and propose design dimensions that inform the design of our vocabulary, but can also inform the design of alternate vocabularies. we validate this interaction vocabulary with a proof of concept system that addresses the core components of 3d modeling and a user study that shows that the interface is useful in replicating and creating original designs. our study also identified some limitations which we discuss with possible solutions, but it also hints at future possibilities in this largely unexplored design space. while our focus was on 3d solid modeling, the design dimensions can also inform vocabularies for other applications like gaming, data visualization, and simulation control. our work can guide future researchers and designers by extending the vr interaction space beyond traditional input devices.",677
RotoSwype: Word-Gesture Typing using a Ring,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300244,"we propose rotoswype, a technique for word-gesture typing using the orientation of a ring worn on the index finger. rotoswype enables one-handed text-input without encumbering the hand with a device, a desirable quality in many scenarios, including virtual or augmented reality. the method is evaluated using two arm positions: with the hand raised up with the palm parallel to the ground; and with the hand resting at the side with the palm facing the body. a five-day study finds both hand positions achieved speeds of at least 14 words-per-minute (wpm) with uncorrected error rates near 1%, outperforming previous comparable techniques. in this paper we introduced rotoswype, a ring-tilt based textentry technique that enables unencumbered, one-handed, self-contained, and eyes-away typing that enables wordgesture typing on any qwerty keyboard on any device. we design and build the technique for the hand-up and handdown postures. for hand-up, we further compare two baseposes of the hand, pts and ptg, and choose pts based on a preliminary study. in a 5-day study, we evaluate rotoswype for text-entry for ar/vr hmds. the results show that with <60 mins of typing, participants achieve speeds of >14 wpm with a near 1% uncorrected error rate for both hu and hd postures, outperforming existing unencumbered techniques that use ring-input or swiping on glasses. we further discuss subjective feedback, design outcomes, improvements, and wider applicability for future work.",678
BeamBand: Hand Gesture Sensing with Ultrasonic Beamforming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300245,"beamband is a wrist-worn system that uses ultrasonic beamforming for hand gesture sensing. using an array of small transducers, arranged on the wrist, we can ensem-ble acoustic wavefronts to project acoustic energy at spec-ified angles and focal lengths. this allows us to interro-gate the surface geometry of the hand with inaudible sound in a raster-scan-like manner, from multiple view-points. we use the resulting, characteristic reflections to recognize hand pose at 8 fps. in our user study, we found that beamband supports a six-class hand gesture set at 94.6% accuracy. even across sessions, when the sensor is removed and reworn later, accuracy remains high: 89.4%. we describe our software and hardware, and future ave-nues for integration into devices such as smartwatches and vr controllers. we have presented beamband, a novel worn sensing method that uses ultrasonic beamforming for on-body hand gesture recognition. beamband projects ultrasonic wavefronts at different angles and focal points on the user’s hand, and measures waves reflected back to the band. we evaluated two gesture sets sourced from the literature and our user study reveals promising accuracies, both withinsession and across-session. we hope our effort will act as a catalyst for deeper investigation into ultrasonic beamforming for enabling novel interactions.",679
Airport Accessibility and Navigation Assistance for People with Visual Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300246,"people with visual impairments often have to rely on the assistance of sighted guides in airports, which prevents them from having an independent travel experience. in order to learn about their perspectives on current airport accessibility, we conducted two focus groups that discussed their needs and experiences in-depth, as well as the potential role of assistive technologies. we found that independent navigation is a main challenge and severely impacts their overall experience. as a result, we equipped an airport with a bluetooth low energy (ble) beacon-based navigation system and performed a real-world study where users navigated routes relevant for their travel experience. we found that despite the challenging environment participants were able to complete their itinerary independently, presenting none to few navigation errors and reasonable timings. this study presents the first systematic evaluation posing ble technology as a strong approach to increase the independence of visually impaired people in airports. we presented the fndings of two focus groups that illustrate the perceptions that people with visual impairments have regarding the accessibility of airports, which have been neglected in the literature [38]. these fndings suggest that the main constraints experienced by visually impaired people in airports occur after being escorted to their gate. at this point, their lack of knowledge of the environment and their fear of getting lost leads to a single option: sitting and waiting. in order to empower them with more independence, we installed a ble beacon-based navigation system (navcog) at the pittsburgh international airport and analyzed its efect. results of a study with ten visually impaired people showed that the system was able to cope with many navigation challenges of airports, such as users frequent veering in wide open areas. the low number of navigation errors and reasonable route completion times pose indoor navigation assistance as a promising tool to support independent mobility and to enhance the experience of visually impaired people in airports. however, a few navigation errors (or researcher’s occasional need to intervene) also show that greater localization accuracy may be required when traversing areasthat may present greater risks to the user’s (or environment) safety. to the best of our knowledge, this is the frst formal evaluation of a working navigation system for visually impaired people at an airport. we note that most airports are already equipped or plan to equip their sites with ble beacons. in addition, other localization methods (e.g., based on wi-fi) may become viable alternatives in the near future, easing the deployment and maintenance of apps like navcog. despite the availability of the required infrastructure, what is currently lacking is both the awareness and the support of the navigation needs of visually impaired travelers. we believe this study can be a valuable benchmark for new installations and for formal evaluation of navigation systems that are already in place [7, 33, 37].",680
Effects of Moderation and Opinion Heterogeneity on Attitude towards the Online Deliberation Experience,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300247,"online deliberation offers a way for citizens to collectively discuss an issue and provide input for policymakers. the overall experience of online deliberation can be affected by multiple factors. we decided to investigate the effects of moderation and opinion heterogeneity on the perceived deliberation experience, by running the first online deliberation experiment in singapore. our study took place in three months with three phases. in phase 1, our 2,006 participants answered a survey, that we used to create groups of different opinion heterogeneity. during the second phase, 510 participants discussed about the population issue on the online platform we developed. we gathered data on their online deliberation experience during phase 3. we found out that higher levels of moderation negatively impact the experience of deliberation on perceived procedural fairness, validity claim and policy legitimacy; and that high opinion heterogeneity is important in order to get a fair assessment of the deliberation experience. we introduced our own open-source platform, which we built based on design recommendations from previous works. during the deliberation phase, we evaluated how moderation and opinion heterogeneity may impact users’ overall experience of deliberation. we found that higher levels of moderation may degrade the overall experience. we also found that opinion heterogeneity seems to be strongly linked to the chi 2019 paper chi 2019, may 4–9, 2019, glasgow, scotland, uk paper 17 page 10 perceptions of the participants, and therefore suggest to use high heterogeneity with mixed opinion in order to avoid any perception bias, positive or negative, based on one’s existing opinions on the policies. in terms of the singapore context, our results suggest that despite of the unique political setting, participants were overall satisfied with their experience, and would be likely to support future deliberation practices like such.",681
MilliSonic: Pushing the Limits of Acoustic Motion Tracking,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300248,"recent years have seen interest in device tracking and localization using acoustic signals. state-of-the-art acoustic motion tracking systems however do not achieve millimeter accuracy and require large separation between microphones and speakers, and as a result, do not meet the requirements for many vr/ar applications. further, tracking multiple concurrent acoustic transmissions from vr devices today requires sacrificing accuracy or frame rate. we present millisonic, a novel system that pushes the limits of acoustic based motion tracking. our core contribution is a novel localization algorithm that can provably achieve sub-millimeter 1d tracking accuracy in the presence of multipath, while using only a single beacon with a small 4-microphone array.further, millisonic enables concurrent tracking of up to four smartphones without reducing frame rate or accuracy. our evaluation shows that millisonic achieves 0.7mm median 1d accuracy and a 2.6mm median 3d accuracy for smartphones, which is 5x more accurate than state-of-the-art systems. millisonic enables two previously infeasible interaction applications: a) 3d tracking of vr headsets using the smartphone as a beacon and b) fine-grained 3d tracking for the google cardboard vr system using a small microphone array. we present millisonic, a novel system that pushes the limits of acoustic based motion tracking and localization. we show for the first time how to achieve sub-mm 1d tracking and localization accuracies using acoustic signals on smartphones, in the presence of multipath. to achieve this, we introduce algorithms that use the phase of fmcw signals to disambiguate between multiple paths. we also enable multiple smartphones to transmit concurrently using time-shifted fmcw acoustic signals and enable concurrent tracking without sacrificing accuracy or frame rate. while this paper presents multiple benchmarks, user studies and evaluation in indoor and outdoor environments, more extensive evaluation is required to understand its behavior in various edge cases as well as in rooms with significant multipath that can adversely affect accuracy. here, we discuss the limitations of our current system design. first, we support simple occlusions such as fabric and paper, but do not support human limbs or the device itself. additional algorithmic development is required to support these practical occlusion scenarios. second, while our design has better drift characteristics than prior work on acoustic tracking, further work is required to make it comparable to optical based systems. one approach is to perform sensor fusion with imu data and achieve better accuracy, lower latency and more resilience to clock drifts. this could also enable vr headset tracking while using a mobile beacon (i.e., smartphone) in the hand instead of placing it on a table. our current range is limited to 2 m. this is because the microphones in our array prototype are not optimized for performance and are not designed to have optimal response in the 17.5–23.5 khz frequencies. finally, we support upto 4–5 concurrent smartphone acoustic transmissions without affecting the frame rate per device. one way to increase the number of concurrent devices is to use longer chirps so as to support more time-shifted fmcw chirps that can be allocated to different smartphones. this however comes at the expense of the frame rate per device.",682
Casual Microtasking: Embedding Microtasks in Facebook,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300249,"microtasks enable people with limited time and context to contribute to a larger task. in this paper we explore casual microtasking, where microtasks are embedded into other primary activities so that they are available to be completed when convenient. we present a casual microtasking experience that inserts writing microtasks from an existing microwriting tool into the user's facebook feed. from a two-week deployment of the system with nine people, we observe that casual microtasking enabled participants to get things done during their breaks, and that they tended to do so only after first engaging with facebook's social content. participants were most likely to complete the writing microtasks during periods of the day associated with low focus, and would occasionally use them as a springboard to open the original document in word. these findings suggest casual microtasking can help people leverage spare micromoments to achieve meaningful micro-goals, and even encourage them to return to work. we studied casual microtasking by inserting writing microtasks into people’s facebook feeds. by analyzing this experience with nine people over two weeks, we find that casual microtasking enabled participants to make writing contributions in a lightweight way during their facebook breaks while still allowing them to ignore the microtasks when they did not feel like engaging with work. casual microtasking was particularly useful for completing microtasks associated with low-priority documents that required limited context because it helped them stay engaged with those documents without committing to larger edits. casual microtasking offers a new way for individuals to complete work in alternative contexts, acting an avenue for reminding, completing secondary tasks, and returning to productivity.",683
Making Sense of Art: Access for Gallery Visitors with Vision Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300250,"while there is widespread recognition of the need to provide people with vision impairments (pvi) equitable access to cultural institutions such as art galleries, this is not easy. we present the results of a collaboration with a regional art gallery who wished to open their collection to pvis in the local community. we describe a novel model that provides three different ways of accessing the gallery, depending upon visual acuity and mobility: virtual tours, self-guided tours and guided tours. as far as possible the model supports autonomous exploration by pvis. it was informed by a value sensitive design exploration of the values and value conflicts of the primary stakeholders. in this paper we have presented a values-based model for providing people with vision impairments equitable access to art galleries. the model was developed in collaboration with a regional gallery using value sensitive design. we conducted a formative study comparing different tactile presentation methods, then our main study which explored stakeholder values and initial ideas for the model. finally, we conducted a pilot evaluation. user evaluation was extremely positive, and bag is now planning to deploy the model more widely. our research provides the first values-based framework and model for accessible access to cultural institutions. in particular, it highlights the importance of supporting independence and autonomy of visitors with visual impairments, and involving the artists when developing audio descriptions and translating their work into other sensory modalities. by clarifying stakeholder values and conflicts, our research helps ground future research into the use of it technologies for this purpose. for example, it demonstrates the importance of providing online access both for pvis with limited mobility and to prepare more mobile pvis for a physical visit. further, it motivates the use of digital design and manufacturing techniques such as 3d printing and laser cutting in the production of tactile presentations as well as research into wayfinding technologies for use in the gallery and supporting access with emerging virtual and augmented reality systems.",684
Co-Design Beyond Words: 'Moments of Interaction' with Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300251,"existing co-design methods support verbal children on the autism spectrum in the design process, while their minimally-verbal peers are overlooked. we describe co-design beyond words (cdbw), an approach which merges existing co-design methods with practice-based methods from speech and language therapy which are child-led and interests-based. these emphasise the rich detail that can be conveyed in the moment, through recognising occurrences of, for example, joint attention, turn taking and imitation. we worked in an autism-specific primary school over 20 weeks with ten children, aged 5 to 8. we co-designed a playful prototype, the tangiball, using the three iterative phases of cdbw; the foundation phase (preparation for interaction), the interaction phase (designing-and-reflecting in the moment) and the reflection phase (reflection-on-action). we contribute a novel co-design approach and present moments of interaction, the micro instances in design in which minimally-verbal children on the spectrum can convey meaning beyond words, through their actions, interactions, and attentional foci. these moments of interaction provide design insight, shape design direction, and reveal unique strengths, interests, and abilities. this work contributes co-design beyond words, a childled approach to co-design with minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum. this approach values moments of interaction – social instances of connection, communication, or understanding between individuals (such as children and facilitating adults). we suggest that moments of interaction are important during the co-design process, as current codesign approaches operate at high cognitive and social levels, often misaligned with the existing skills and motivations of minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum. this paper identifies an opportunity, and perhaps an obligation, for hci researchers to address this imbalance. we highlight the importance of working towards methods, designs, and mind-sets that are inclusive, supportive, and empowering of minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum and other communities who communicate differently, as we work towards answering the question: how does one have a voice in design if one is not verbal?",685
Emotional Utility and Recall of the Facebook News Feed,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300252,"we report a laboratory study (n=53) in which participants browsed their own facebook news feeds for 10-15 minutes, choosing exactly when to quit, and later rated the overall emotional utility of the episode before attempting to recall threads. finally, the emotional utility of each encountered thread was rated while looking over a recording of the interaction. we report that facebook browsing was, overall, an emotionally positive experience; that recall of threads exhibited classic primacy and recency serial order effects; that recalled threads were both more positive and more valenced (less neutral) on average, than forgotten threads; and that overall emotional valence judgments were predicted, statistically, by the peak and end thread judgments. we find no evidence that local quit decisions were driven by the emotional utility of threads. in the light of these findings, we discuss the suggestion that emotional utility might partly explain the attractiveness of reading the news feed, and that an emotional memory bias might further increase the attractiveness of the newsfeed in prospect. our main, overarching aim in this study is to introduce the idea of emotional utility, and how this interacts with memory as part of the explanation for the attractiveness of the facebook news feed. our experiment has demonstrated the potential of using simple emotional utility ratings to throw light on aspects of facebook use, and, in particular, on how memory for the experience of using facebook might contribute to its attractiveness in prospect.",686
"The Breaking Hand: Skills, Care, and Sufferings of the Hands of an Electronic Waste Worker in Bangladesh",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300253,"while repair work has recently been getting increasing attention in hci, recycling practices have still remained relatively understudied, especially in the context of the global south. to this end, building on our eight-month-long ethnography, this paper reports the electronic waste (`e-waste', henceforth) recycling practices among the e-waste recycler (`bhangari') communities in dhaka, bangladesh. in doing so, this paper offers the work of the bhangaris through an articulation of their hands and their uses. drawing from a rich body of scholarly work on social science, we define and contextualize three characteristics of the hand of a bhangari: knowledge, care, and skills and collaboration. our study also highlights the pains and sufferings involved in this profession. by explaining bhangari work through the hand, we also discuss its implications for design, and its connection to hci's broader interest in sustainability. in the sections above, we have presented the electronic recycling practices in the main four e-waste markets in dhaka, bangladesh. we have shown how bhangaris, the e-waste workers, collect, sort, dismantle, and dispose broken electronics step-by-step. we have further focused on the role of the hand of bhangaris to deepen our understanding of their work. we have demonstrated how the hand of a bhangari is used to know, extend care, and perform collaborative and skillful work in this profession. finally, we have also reported the pains and suffering of their hand due to various injuries and exposure to harmful chemicals. this study thus provides a deep understanding of bhangaris’ interaction with broken computing devices, and open up new scopes for hci in both design and theory fronts. first, our work documents the informal process of e-waste management, an area that has been under-explored in hci. this paper joins the growing body of work on the afteruse phase of digital technologies in informal markets in the global south, and demonstrates the important human factors involved in it. through an articulation of handworks, our study shows how bhangaris’ skills, experience, art, craft, knowledge, and suffering are involved in the e-waste management in bangladesh. we note that bhangari works are often undervalued (our own study shows bhangaris are often neglected in the society), but they contribute significantly to sustainable digital consumption. our study also shows how bhangari markets are also a place of innovation, repurposing, and improvisation, which supports similar observations in other places in the global south [11, 12, 65]. while such innovation in the repair market is often confined within producing novel electronics, bhangaris innovate all kinds of artifacts - starting from looking glass to the toothpick, and from paperweight to hair comb. hence, we posit that bhangari work should be considered as an important site for innovation and sustainability studies in hci. second, our work demonstrates an unsafe working condition for the bhangaris. we have also discussed the sociotechnical complexities around this problem of occupational hazards in bhangari work. we call for hci research to take a deeper look into this issue, along with the ongoing policy initiatives coming from other disciplines [55, 78, 90]. hci research can focus on designing safe tools, techniques, and workplaces that will protect the bhangaris from the physical harm associated with recycling broken electronics in different phases. considering the social and economic conditions of the bhangaris, design of such artifacts should be inexpensive and culturally appropriate. besides such direct design interventions to bhangari work, we can also design technologies to create mass awareness, and a nation-wide movement to persuade the government to make policy and enforce laws that are required to ensure a safe working environment for this vulnerable and marginalized population in bangladesh. third, our study brings to the fore the tactile experiences of touching the broken electronics - a barely explored area in hci. hci’s central focus on ‘design’ and ‘use’ of technology has mostly confined the experience of touch within these two phases of the life-cycle of a technology. as a result, a rich set of experiences that take place when people touch a nonfunctioning, malfunctioning, or broken technologies have not gotten enough attention in hci. this paper intends to draw the attention of hci researchers of tangible interfaces and ergonomics to the tactile experiences of the bhangaris while interacting with the broken electronics. we argue that a research that may stem from this work can benefit hci research on tangible interfaces in various ways. for example, by extending the designer’s vision from use to after-use phase will allow them to take into account the tactile experiences of the electronic waste workers in their design, as also indicated by maestri and wakkary [51]. novel technologies can be built that are equally friendly for the users, repairers, and recyclers. furthermore, many of the tactile experiences and hand activities of bhangari work can introduce many novel interactions in hci. for example, twisting, pinching, rubbing, or bending an electronic device may introduce new modes of interactions with computing devices that are not much prevalent today. fourth, in this study, we have used hand as the center of our analysis of bhangari work. there are many professions, especially art and craft works, that are mostly done by hand. hence, the hand has long been a center of interest for social scientists and anthropologists [27, 53, 54, 93]. while many works require our active and skillful interactions with computing devices through hands, it is still a relatively an underused method of understanding human-computer interaction in hci research. it should be noted that a long-standing hci work on ergonomics looks at hand in a very functional dimension (and measure comfort, ease, efficiency through performances). however, the hand that we propose to study goes far beyond that and encompasses the emotional, artistic, skillful, emotional, and political dimensions of work. in this paper, by putting the hand at the center, we have shown how different modes of a hand constitute the work of breaking computers and how a rich set of human emotions and social contexts are attached to them. studying hands will provide a detailed explanation of the skills involved in a work, and the politics and emotions associated with them. we argue that such findings are valuable in designing better technologies that embody tangible experiences of users, by leveraging the functional and emotional dimensions of work.",687
EarTouch: Facilitating Smartphone Use for Visually Impaired People in Mobile and Public Scenarios,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300254,"interacting with a smartphone using touch input and speech output is challenging for visually impaired people in mobile and public scenarios, where only one hand may be available for input (e.g., while holding a cane) and using the loudspeaker for speech output is constrained by environmental noise, privacy, and social concerns. to address these issues, we propose eartouch, a one-handed interaction technique that allows the users to interact with a smartphone using the ear to perform gestures on the touchscreen. users hold the phone to their ears and listen to speech output from the ear speaker privately. we report how the technique was designed, implemented, and evaluated through a series of studies. results show that eartouch is easy, efficient, fun and socially acceptable to use. we present eartouch, a novel interaction technique that facilitates smartphone use for bvi people in mobile and public scenarios. eartouch not only improves one-handed use, but also provides an alternative to protect privacy and avoid social awkwardness. we actively engaged 36 bvi smartphone users in the design and evaluation of eartouch based on formative interviews and user-participatory design activities. in a broader sense, eartouch brings us an important step closer to accessible smartphones for all users of all abilities.",688
Diagnosing and Coping with Mode Errors in Korean-English Dual-language Keyboard,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300255,"in countries where languages with non-latin characters are prevalent, people use a keyboard with two language modes namely, the native language and english, and often experience mode errors. to diagnose the mode error problem, we conducted a field study and observed that 78% of the mode errors occurred immediately after application switching. we implemented four methods (auto-switch, preview, smart-toggle, and preview & smart-toggle) based on three strategies to deal with the mode error problem and conducted field studies to verify their effectiveness. in the studies considering korean-english dual input, auto-switch was ineffective. on the contrary, preview significantly reduced the mode errors from 75.1% to 41.3%, and smart-toggle saved typing cost for recovering from mode errors. in preview & smart-toggle, preview reduced mode errors and smart-toggle handled 86.2% of the mode errors that slipped past preview. these results suggest that preview & smart-toggle is a promising method for preventing mode errors for the korean-english dual-input environment. in this study, we observed that a majority (78.3%) of the mode errors occurred immediately after an application switch. we considered four methods to help users deal with mode errors that follow an application switch. through a series of field studies in the korean-english dual-input environment, we observed that auto-switch was not accepted well, preview could reduce the mode errors significantly (from 75.1% to 41.3%), and smart-toggle was adopted well by users (71.4% of the time). we also observed that preview & smart-toggle was an effective complementary combination of preview and smart-toggle. we conclude that preview & smart-toggle is the best among the four methods for preventing mode errors for the korean-english dual-input environment.",689
Impact of Contextual Factors on Snapchat Public Sharing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300256,"public sharing is integral to online platforms. this includes the popular multimedia messaging application snapchat, on which public sharing is relatively new and unexplored in prior research. in mobile-first applications, sharing contexts are dynamic. however, it is unclear how context impacts users' sharing decisions. as platforms increasingly rely on user-generated content, it is important to also broadly understand user motivations and considerations in public sharing. we explored these aspects of content sharing through a survey of 1,515 snapchat users. our results indicate that users primarily have intrinsic motivations for publicly sharing snaps, such as to share an experience with the world, but also have considerations related to audience and sensitivity of content. additionally, we found that snaps shared publicly were contextually different from those privately shared. our findings suggest that content sharing systems can be designed to support sharing motivations, yet also be sensitive to private contexts. we conducted a survey to explore the role of context in sharing decisions on snapchat, as well as users’ general motivations and considerations when publicly sharing content. we observed that some contexts, such as snaps of people or snaps taken inside a home, were more likely to be privately shared to my story, and were associated with less comfort with publicly sharing to our story. additionally, participants’ motivations for public sharing were largely intrinsic, while considerations centered around the audience and content of the snap. as such, our indings can inform the design of context-aware applications to better support user decisionmaking and preferences.",690
Cluster Touch: Improving Touch Accuracy on Smartphones for People with Motor and Situational Impairments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300257,"we present cluster touch, a combined user-independent and user-specific touch offset model that improves the accuracy of touch input on smartphones for people with motor impairments, and for people experiencing situational impairments while walking. cluster touch combines touch examples from multiple users to create a shared user-independent touch model, which is then updated with touch examples provided by an individual user to make it user-specific. owing to this combination, cluster touch allows people to quickly improve the accuracy of their smartphones by providing only 20 touch examples. in a user study with 12 people with motor impairments and 12 people without motor impairments, but who were walking, cluster touch improved touch accuracy by 14.65% for the former group and 6.81% for the latter group over the native touch sensor. furthermore, in an offline analysis of existing mobile interfaces, cluster touch improved touch accuracy by 8.21% and 4.84% over the native touch sensor for the two user groups, respectively. we have investigated touch offsets created by people with motor impairments, and by people without impairments while walking and standing. our analysis found that users across groups exhibited similar touch behaviors regarding where touches occur relative to their intended targets, but that the magnitude of these errors was more pronounced for people with motor impairments and for walking people than for people who were standing. to improve touch screen accuracy for people with motor impairments, and for people in motor-impairing situations, we created cluster touch, a combined user-independent and user-specific touch model that can improve touch accuracy by collecting only 20 touch examples from the target user. in an evaluation of cluster touch, we found that it was significantly more accurate in predicting intended target locations for people with motor impairments than the touch sensors found in the google nexus 6 smartphone. cluster touch also improved accuracy over two prior statistical machine learning models, gaussian process [55] and linear offset [9]. we also found that cluster touch was able to improve touch accuracy for people without impairments who were walking, demonstrating that cluster touch has the potential to provide accuracy improvements for a range of users in different situations.",691
MindDot: Supporting Effective Cognitive Behaviors in Concept Map-Based Learning Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300258,"while prior research has revealed the promising impact of concept mapping on learning, few have comprehensively modeled different cognitive behaviors during concept mapping. in addition, existing concept mapping tools lack effective feedback to support better learning behaviors. this work presents minddot, a concept map-based learning environment that facilitates the cognitive process of comparing and integrating related concepts via two forms of support. a hyperlink support and an expert template. study results suggested that both types of support had positive impact on the development of comparative strategies and that hyperlink support enhanced learning. we further evaluated the cognitive learning progress at a fine-grained level with two forms of visualizations. we then extracted several behavioral patterns that provided insights about the cognitive progress in learning. lastly, we derive design recommendations that we hope will inspire future intelligent tutoring systems that automatically evaluate students' learning behaviors and foster them in developing effective learning behaviors. in this work, we presented minddot, a concept map based learning environment that supports concept mapping through innovative integration of two features, hyperlink navigation and expert template. the strength and novelty of our system lie in its ability to assist students in developing comparative strategies. our controlled study showed that students with hyperlink support outperformed the ones without hyperlink support. the system also demonstrated promising impact on supporting comparative strategies. we then presented a deeper and fine-grained understanding of how students employ comparative strategies, finding that there are indeed certain sequences of behaviors in the text (e.g., reading before adding a link) that suggest that students are making comparisons. finally, we derive three major design recommendations for future concept mapping systems to foster the development of comparative strategies and enhancing learning outcomes: integrate tools with learning content, provide support that doubles as assessment, and adaptively support comparative strategies. using computer-based concept mapping tools to facilitate concept mapping processes has the potential to substantially improve students’ abilities to comprehend expository texts.",692
Changing Perspective: A Co-Design Approach to Explore Future Possibilities of Divergent Hearing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300259,"conventional hearing aids frame hearing impairment almost exclusively as a problem. in the present paper, we took an alternative approach by focusing on positive future possibilities of 'divergent hearing'. to this end, we developed a method to speculate simultaneously about not-yet-experienced positive meanings and not-yet-existing technology. first, we gathered already existing activities in which divergent hearing was experienced as an advantage rather than as a burden. these activities were then condensed into 'prompts of positive possibilities' (ppp), such as 'creating a shelter to feel safe in"". in performative sessions, participants were given these ppps and 'open probes' to enact novel everyday activities. this led to 26 possible meanings and according devices, such as ""being able to listen back into the past with a rewinder"". the paper provides valuable insights into the interests and expectations of people with divergent hearing as well as a methodological contribution to a possibility-driven design. the present study focused on potential advantages of divergent hearing. for a problem-driven technology, such as hearing aids, this perspective is uncommon. we reframed ‘non-normal hearing’ as ‘divergent hearing’ to change its meaning from a disability to a possibility for enhancement and empowerment. one may argue that this is a rather cynical view, mainly sugarcoating the manifold problems arising from hearing loss. while we certainly neither want to trivialize problems nor argue against technological progress, we believe that a change of perspective is not only helpful, but also in the interest of people with divergent hearing. it broadens the view rather than limits it. in addition, participants neither found it inappropriate nor pejorative to talk about positive aspects of their divergent hearing. they enjoyed involving themselves in speculations about future activities and devices. besides the new perspective on ‘non-normal’ hearing and related technologies, the present study also provided an innovative methodological approach to explore potential positive activities and technologies involved. this approach neither started from a particular technology to speculate about emerging activities, nor from given activities to speculate about novel technologies. it simultaneously provided ambiguous meaning grounded in human experience and ambiguous material grounded in the human body. by instilling a performative dialogue among injected meaning, given material and the participant, possible activities emerged in which all elements mutually constituted themselves. on the one hand, each single of those entanglements is a useful anecdote by itself telling a situated story about a positive future activity, thereby serving as inspiration for design. on the other hand, it was possible to further group activities to provide an idea of the topics and technologies people with divergent hearing are interested in. in sum, we found fostering ‘intra-active’ dynamics through our particular method helpful and promising, both for exploring future activities in possibilitydriven design and for changing the perspective on the predominantly problem-driven approach to hearing technology.",693
Failing with Style: Designing for Aesthetic Failure in Interactive Performance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300260,"failure is a common artefact of challenging experiences, a fact of life for interactive systems but also a resource for aesthetic and improvisational performance. we present a study of how three professional pianists performed an interactive piano composition that included playing hidden codes within the music so as to control their path through the piece and trigger system actions. we reveal how apparent failures to play the codes occurred for diverse reasons including mistakes in their playing, limitations of the system, but also deliberate failures as a way of controlling the system, and how these failures provoked aesthetic and improvised responses from the performers. we propose that creative and performative interfaces should be designed to enable aesthetic failures and introduce a taxonomy that compares human approaches to failure with approaches to capable systems, revealing new creative design strategies of gaming, taming, riding and serving the system. we have revealed how failure in live performance is both a complex and aesthetically important matter. failure can be considered as being multi-layered, with failure at one level often relying on success at another and vice versa, leading to variation, improvisation and liveness. we have revealed how humans can adopt diverse strategies to responding to and also deliberately invoking failure in interaction, potentially gaming, taming, riding and even serving the system and have proposed that such strategies may benefit several areas of hci including cultural and entertainment computing, human-robot interactions and conversational interfaces. we encourage researchers and practitioners to consider failure as both a layered and aesthetic matter and to be open to creative strategies for engaging with failure that: enable humans to better assert their creativity with increasingly capable systems; enable autonomous and intelligent systems to better reason about the complexities of failure; and ultimately design systems that are themselves capable of failing in appropriate and aesthetic ways.",694
"The Channel Matters: Self-disclosure, Reciprocity and Social Support in Online Cancer Support Groups",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300261,"people with health concerns go to online health support groups to obtain help and advice. to do so, they frequently disclose personal details, many times in public. although research in non-health settings suggests that people self-disclose less in public than in private, this pattern may not apply to health support groups where people want to get relevant help. our work examines how the use of private and public channels influences members' self-disclosure in an online cancer support group, and how channels moderate the influence of self-disclosure on reciprocity and receiving support. by automatically measuring people's self-disclosure at scale, we found that members of cancer support groups revealed more negative self-disclosure in the public channels compared to the private channels. although one's self-disclosure leads others to self-disclose and to provide support, these effects were generally stronger in the private channel. these channel effects probably occur because the public channels are the primary venue for support exchange, while the private channels are mainly used for follow-up conversations. we discuss theoretical and practical implications of our work. this research examined how members self-disclosed in private and public channels in an online cancer support community, and how channel differences moderated the reciprocity of self-disclosure and the social support they received. to summarize the major results: • h1 and h2: people expressed more negative self-disclosure when starting threads to seek support than when replying to them. when replying to others, people expressed more negative self-disclosure in public channel, revealing more about negative aspects of their lives. • h3: reciprocity occurred for negative self-disclosure. the reciprocity effect was stronger in the private channel than in the public one. • h4: senders’ negative self-disclosure was associated with their receiving both informational and emotional support. again, these effects were stronger in the private channel. the effects of self-disclosure on receiving support were mediated by the effects of self-disclosure on judgments that people were seeking support, with complete mediation in the case of emotional support and partial mediation in the case of informational support. specifically, senders’ negative self-disclosure was associated with the perception that they were seeking both emotional and informational support which, in turn, was associated with them receiving the corresponding type of support.",695
Design Goals for Playful Technology to Support Physical Activity Among Wheelchair Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300262,"playful technology has the potential to support physical activity (pa) among wheelchair users, but little is known about design considerations for this audience, who experience significant access barriers. in this paper, we lever-age the integrated behavioural model (ibm) to understand wheelchair users' perspectives on pa, technology, and play.first, we present findings from an interview study with eight physically active wheelchair users. second, we build on the interviews in a survey that received 44 responses from a broader group of wheelchair users. results show that the anticipation of positive experiences was the strongest predictor of engagement with pa, and that accessibility concerns act as barriers both in terms of pa participation and technology use. we present four design goals - emphasizing enjoyment,involving others, building knowledge and enabling flexibility - to make our findings actionable for researchers and designers wishing to create accessible playful technology to support pa. playful technology has the potential to support pa, but there has been little research regarding the design of playful technology for wheelchair users. our work provides a mixedmethods enquiry into manual wheelchair users’ perspectives on pa and technology, leveraging the ibm to provide an indepth exploration. findings highlight that anticipation of positive experiences is the strongest predictor of engagement with pa, supporting the development of playful solutions that by nature can highlight this element. thereby, our research contributes to the growing body of humancomputer interaction research addressing the development of technology for people with disabilities that extends beyond accessibility considerations, enabling other researchers and designers to create playful technology that can support pa among wheelchair users.",696
Designing 'True Colors': A Social Wearable that Affords Vulnerability,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300263,"vulnerability is a common experience in everyday life and is frequently perceived as a flaw to be excised in technology design. yet, research indicates it is an essential aspect of wholehearted living among others. in this paper, we present the design and deployment of 'true colors', a novel wearable device intended to support social interaction in a live action roleplay game (larp) setting. we describe the research-through-design process that helped us to discover and articulate the possibility space of vulnerability in the design of social wearables, as support for producing a sense of social empowerment and connection among wearers within the larp. we draw conclusions that may be of value to others designing wearables and related technologies aimed at supporting co-located social interaction in games/play. we designed and then tested true colors, a social wearable meant to augment co-located social interaction in a larp context. the final design worked well within the larp narrative and world mechanics, supporting valuable social interactions among players. to both the researchers’ and the larp designers’ surprise, players eschewed the more combative possibilities of the wearables, instead focusing on the opportunities that the devices afforded for engaging in collaborative, supportive social encounters. by gravitating towards using breakdowns and healing functions, the players emphasized the social value of experiencing vulnerability together. this paper extends previous work on wearable technology in larps [41] and includes key components that supported embracing vulnerability, including supporting emotional resonance, social signaling, and spectator sensitivity (e.g. of moments of weakness); supporting authentic self-presentation and choice; and supporting overcoming difficulties together (e.g. through social touch). although our insights are limited to games/play (particularly similar forms of larps), it validates previous works on social affordances for larping [41] and in games and play more generally [35]. our results together with these works point to the value of social affordances as good guiding design concepts that provide a fruitful level of abstraction and concreteness. similarly to experiential qualities [40], they focus on user experiences, yet explicitly referring to and evoking social ones. they are also concrete enough to relate to properties of the technology, such as its functionality, interactivity, and (technology) affordances [20]. vulnerability has been researched and established as valuable positive and valuable from an emotional and social point of view [7]. here, we add to that work relating vulnerability to valuable experiential qualities, design concepts and features (social affordances), which provides a good starting point to extended design work to support embracing vulnerability. also, our observations of, and data from, players embracing vulnerability through wearables adds to previous empirical data substantiating and illustrating the value of embracing vulnerability [7]. last, our strategies to design for vulnerability resonate with previous research insights of those who live fully through embracing vulnerability [7]: they cultivate authenticity (supporting authentic self-presentation); “dare greatly” to live “wholeheartedly” (supporting ‘big feels’); do so together (overcoming difficulties together); and do so by choice (information, choice, and consent). rather than always being a flaw to be excised, strategic vulnerability has the potential to also produce a sense of social empowerment and connection. although the results presented in this paper were obtained within a larp setting, the design and reception of these wearables reveal an interesting niche for wearables that might inspire others outside the realms of play. still, how one designs for vulnerability beyond the magic circle of games remains unclear. we see the design instance presented in this paper as a first exploration of many more to come. we encourage other designers of technologies in hci to explore new paths that engage people with one another to create deep social connection, and consider the potential value of designing for (appropriate) vulnerability.",697
Investigating Slowness as a Frame to Design Longer-Term Experiences with Personal Data: A Field Study of Olly,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300264,"we describe the design and deployment of olly, a domestic music player that enables people to re-experience digital music they listened to in the past. olly uses its owner's last.fm listening history metadata archive to occasionally select a song from their past, but offers no user control over what is selected or when. we deployed olly in 3 homes for 15 months to explore how its slow pace might support experiences of reflection and reminiscence. findings revealed that olly became highly integrated in participants lives with sustained engagement over time. they drew on olly to reflect on past life experiences and reactions indicated an increase in perceived value of their last.fm archive. olly also provoked reflections on the temporalities of personal data and technology. findings are interpreted to present opportunities for future hci research and practice. we designed olly to critically investigate how its slow pace and temporal expressiveness could sustain longer-term experiences with participants’ respective personal music listening history archives. findings illustrated that olly became integrated into participants’ everyday lives, supporting a range of experiences around it, in addition to direct interactions. they also highlighted how, over time, participants’ perceived their relationship with olly to develop and grow, reinforcing attachment to their last.fm archive and to olly itself. our work highlights the need for future research to explore how new technologies could be designed that embrace unfamiliar constraints, operate independently, emphasize pre- or postinteraction experiences, in addition to moments of direct engagement. designing for slowness and longer-term human-technology relations represents an important area for future research in the hci community. our work contributes a rare account of how slowness can operate as a frame for creating design artifacts that can sustain valued, longer-term experiences with archives of personal data in everyday life. more broadly, our work explores what a different pathway for designing technology that supports rich human experiences of reflection and meaning-making might look like. an overarching goal of our work has been to constructively question normative assumptions in technology design (e.g., creating devices that are always-on, attention grabbing, and ‘waiting for you’). we believe that new possibilities for change can emerge through a design-led approach that combines the crafting of highly resolved design artifacts that offer a concrete ‘feel’ of future possibilities, with longer-term narratives of human experiences of them. not only change that expands how we question assumptions in design, but also change manifested through envisioning, debating, and exploring real alternatives for a different way of being with technology. as new forms of technology mediate our everyday experiences, there is a critical need in the hci community to delve deeply into seemingly mundane activities (like listening to digital music) to ask how our normative assumptions of design, technology use, and human experience are adequate, adaptive, and what we want. the application of slowness and temporality as conceptual frames for design have clear links to growing initiatives in hci investigating how enduring forms of technology can be designed and the implications this might have for people’s everyday lives over time. we hope this research offers another step toward nurturing future initiatives in the hci community that bring the subject of human relations with technology over time more seriously into focus, now and long into the future.",698

Evaluating the Impact of a Mobile Neurofeedback App for Young Children at School and Home,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300266,"about 18% of children in industrialized countries suffer from anxiety. we designed a mobile neurofeedback app, called mind-full, based on existing design guidelines. our goal was for young children in lower socio-economic status schools to improve their ability to self-regulate anxiety by using mind-full. in this paper we report on quantitative outcomes from a sixteen-week field evaluation with 20 young children (aged 5 to 8). our methodological contribution includes using a control group, validated measures of anxiety and stress, and assessing transfer and maintenance. results from teacher and parent behavioral surveys indicated gains in children's ability to self-regulate anxiety at school and home; a decrease in anxious behaviors at home; and cortisol tests showed variable improvement in physiological stress levels. we contribute to hci for mental health with evidence that it is viable to use a mobile app in lower socio-economic status schools to improve children's mental health. our research contributes to hci for mental health by showing the viability of an anxiety intervention using a low-cost, mobile eeg-nf system with a marginalized, hard to reach population of young children. we hope our work contributes to the uptake of a research agenda in positive computing focusing on emotion regulation and socio-emotional learning for young children. we see nf apps like ours as a tool — one of many — needed through children’s lives to help them overcome the negative impacts of poverty and trauma on brain development, and subsequent education and personal development. our results are promising and we urge other researchers to explore how digital mental health applications can be used to support children and their caregivers from marginalized populations.",700
Geodesy: Self-rising 2.5D Tiles by Printing along 2D Geodesic Closed Path,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300267,"thermoplastic and fused deposition modeling (fdm) based 4d printing are rapidly expanding to allow for space- and material-saving 2d printed sheets morphing into 3d shapes when heated. however, to our knowledge, all the known examples are either origami-based models with obvious folding hinges, or beam-based models with holes on the morphing surfaces. morphing continuous double-curvature surfaces remains a challenge, both in terms of a tailored toolpath-planning strategy and a computational model that simulates it. additionally, neither approach takes surface texture as a design parameter in its computational pipeline. to extend the design space of fdm-based 4d printing, in geodesy, we focus on the morphing of continuous double-curvature surfaces or surface textures. we suggest a unique tool path - printing thermoplastics along 2d closed geodesic paths to form a surface with one raised continuous double-curvature tiles when exposed to heat. the design space is further extended to more complex geometries composed of a network of rising tiles (i.e., surface textures). both design components and the computational pipeline are explained in the paper, followed by several printed geometric examples. in this paper, we introduced a novel path planning approach for surfaces with self-rising continuous double-curvature textures. through this work, we hope to empower designers to quickly customize and prototype such morphing surfaces, as well as enrich the toolbox of 4d printing and shape-changing materials. we believe such accumulated advancements following the trajectory of 4d printing literature will enlarge the design space, the practicality, and applicability of fdmbased 4d printing. with the increasing design parameters from single-curvature to double-curvature surfaces; from smooth to textured surfaces; from rigid to flexible structures, we hope a growing community of designers and makers will join us in the journey of democratizing 4d printing.",701
In a Silent Way: Communication Between AI and Improvising Musicians Beyond Sound,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300268,"collaboration is built on trust, and establishing trust with a creative artificial intelligence is difficult when the decision process or internal state driving its behaviour isn't exposed. when human musicians improvise together, a number of extra-musical cues are used to augment musical communication and expose mental or emotional states which affect musical decisions and the effectiveness of the collaboration. we developed a collaborative improvising ai drummer that communicates its confidence through an emoticon-based visualisation. the ai was trained on musical performance data, as well as real-time skin conductance, of musicians improvising with professional drummers, exposing both musical and extra-musical cues to inform its generative process. uni- and bi-directional extra-musical communication with real and false values were tested by experienced improvising musicians. each condition was evaluated using the fss-2 questionnaire, as a proxy for musical engagement. the results show a positive correlation between extra-musical communication of machine internal state and human musical engagement. as interaction with artificial intelligences – and in particular creative improvisers – becomes more commonplace, how we interact and collaborate with co-creational ai systems is an increasingly important area of research. in this paper we have investigated how extra-musical cues between human and ai improvisers can affect the achievement of flow states in an improvising duet. our results demonstrate that, at least for the performers evaluated, communication of a confidence metric improves the human performer’s ability to achieve flow states more readily. additionally, we demonstrated that the resulting improvisational performances are more likely to be perceived positively by non-expert audiences in terms of musical balance between instruements. these results support our hypothesis that the extra-musical communication of ‘internal state’ of the machine to the human can facilitate more engaging human-machine musical interactions. our experimentation with the use of biometric data (sc) as a proxy for the performer’s musical engagement that could be communicated to the ai did not improve the performer’s experience of musical flow, despite prior research showing this to be the case with pairs of improvising human musicians [11]. a difference between this previous study and our own was the location of the sensor: the empatica e4 watch used in our experiments can only be worn on the wrist, whereas the previous study used a sensor attached to the ankle of the performer, to minimise inconsistencies due to movement which are common when improvising during performance. that extra-musical communication of ‘internal state’of the human musician to the machine would also facilitate more engaging human-machine musical interactions was not supported in this study but is also not ruled-out. in further research we aim to draw on other kinds of biometric sensors that are more resilient to the effects of sudden moment that is a necessary part of physical playing and explore other modes of extra-musical communication. conceptualising intelligent machines as creative partners rather than passive tools or instruments is relatively new. while we have a rich and well explored history of improvisation between human performers to draw upon, improvising with an alien, non-human yet active participant creates many exciting new possibilities for human-machine partnerships. the challenge, which we have begun to explore in this paper, is to maximise the creative benefits and possibilities for both performers and audiences.",702
Towards Collaboration Translucence: Giving Meaning to Multimodal Group Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300269,"collocated, face-to-face teamwork remains a pervasive mode of working, which is hard to replicate online. team members' embodied, multimodal interaction with each other and artefacts has been studied by researchers, but due to its complexity, has remained opaque to automated analysis. however, the ready availability of sensors makes it increasingly affordable to instrument work spaces to study teamwork and groupwork. the possibility of visualising key aspects of a collaboration has huge potential for both academic and professional learning, but a frontline challenge is the enrichment of quantitative data streams with the qualitative insights needed to make sense of them. in response, we introduce the concept of collaboration translucence, an approach to make visible selected features of group activity. this is grounded both theoretically (in the physical, epistemic, social and affective dimensions of group activity), and contextually (using domain-specific concepts). we illustrate the approach from the automated analysis of healthcare simulations to train nurses, generating four visual proxies that fuse multimodal data into higher order patterns. to conclude, there is more going on than is visible to the machines. our goal is to improve the resources for interpretation where none existed before, in order to provoke more productive reflection and discussion, grounded for the first time in empirical evidence. in educational terms, therefore, collaboration proxies should serve as scaffolds for formative assessment (feedback for ongoing learning) rather than summative assessment (which assigns a grade). conceivably, as the evidence base grows in size and quality, paterns in the data may be so highly correlated with strong or weak teamwork that they come to serve as proxies for quality. until then, the priority is to further evaluate how students and educators engage with the representations, and how they can be improved.",703
At Your Service: Designing Voice Assistant Personalities to Improve Automotive User Interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300270,"this paper investigates personalized voice characters for in-car speech interfaces. in particular, we report on how we designed different personalities for voice assistants and compared them in a real world driving study. voice assistants have become important for a wide range of use cases, yet current interfaces are using the same style of auditory response in every situation, despite varying user needs and personalities. to close this gap, we designed four assistant personalities (friend, admirer, aunt, and butler) and compared them to a baseline (default) in a between-subject study in real traffic conditions. our results show higher likability and trust for assistants that correctly match the user's personality while we observed lower likability, trust, satisfaction, and usefulness for incorrectly matched personalities, each in comparison with the default character. we discuss design aspects for voice assistants in different automotive use cases. in this paper we explored the influence of personalized voice assistant characters on ux, acceptance, trust, and workload compared to a non-personalized assistant. the results show that personalization has a positive effect on trust and likability if the voice assistant character matches the user’s personality. however, a mismatch can cause displeasure. future voice assistants need to adapt to the user as well as to the environment. our findings provoke the personalization of voice assistants not only on a cultural level as it is already happening, but on a context-aware basis, e.g. being short and precise in driving-related situations, and getting chatty on an empty road when the driver is bored. a neutral assistant is recommended as starting point before gradually adjusting its personality to the user’s needs, either through implicit system decisions or explicit user input. successive work should look into how an optimal assistant personality can be chosen for the driver. furthermore, it would be interesting to investigate how to transfer our findings to driving settings with higher automation levels.",704
Toward Algorithmic Accountability in Public Services: A Qualitative Study of Affected Community Perspectives on Algorithmic Decision-making in Child Welfare Services,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300271,"algorithmic decision-making systems are increasingly being adopted by government public service agencies. researchers, policy experts, and civil rights groups have all voiced concerns that such systems are being deployed without adequate consideration of potential harms, disparate impacts, and public accountability practices. yet little is known about the concerns of those most likely to be affected by these systems. we report on workshops conducted to learn about the concerns of affected communities in the context of child welfare services. the workshops involved 83 study participants including families involved in the child welfare system, employees of child welfare agencies, and service providers. our findings indicate that general distrust in the existing system contributes significantly to low comfort in algorithmic decision-making. we identify strategies for improving comfort through greater transparency and improved communication strategies. we discuss the implications of our study for accountable algorithm design for child welfare applications. the fairness and interpretability of algorithms deployed in consequential decision-making settings has received significant attention in recent years. this has led to a numerous proposals for auditing strategies [15, 45], and the development of models that are constructed to be in some sense ‘fair’ by design [2, 23, 30]. existing work has even explored the algorithmic bias properties of tools deployed in the child welfare system [10]. our study suggests that these technical solutions are in and of themselves insufficient for ensuring that the resulting algorithmic systems are perceived as fair and just. perceptions of algorithmic fairness are heavily influenced by perceptions of procedural and interpersonal justice of the child welfare system as a whole. effective design strategies must therefore consider how technological solutions can be designed to work in concert with complementary policy changes to impact community perceptions of system justice.",705
ActiveInk: (Th)Inking with Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300272,"during sensemaking, people annotate insights: underlining sentences in a document or circling regions on a map. they jot down their hypotheses: drawing correlation lines on scatterplots or creating personal legends to track patterns. we present activeink, a system enabling people to seamlessly transition between exploring data and externalizing their thoughts using pen and touch. activeink enables the natural use of pen for active reading behaviors, while supporting analytic actions by activating any of these ink strokes. through a qualitative study with eight participants, we contribute observations of active reading behaviors during data exploration and design principles to support sensemaking. activeink represents a foray into active reading applications for heterogeneous data including visualizations, maps, and documents. it blends the operations of externalizing thoughts with analytic actions in a seamless combination of functions to be carried out with digital pen+touch. the hybrid interface of activeink integrates two ways of working with pen actions, which our study revealed to be complementary for sensemaking activities. prefix inking is useful for batch operations, while postfix ink activation is useful for interleaving multiple actions with externalizing thoughts. this work offers several opportunities for extension. the ink recognition system we used does not distinguish between classes of marks, such as enclosures, underlines, and arrows. our data selection model associates marks with any data items enclosed or intersected by an ink stroke. distinguishing types of mark could be interesting to implement a finer inkdata association strategy. activeink was made to demonstrate the possibilities of thinking with ink, but does not scale to a large number of views or with very large volumes of data. addressing scalability issues requires further development, and implementing the ability to save, recall, and share analysis canvases. it also implies adding support for a wider diversity of charts, which could be achieved by moving to, e.g., vega-lite [28]. to better understand the impact of activeink on sensemaking and externalization, including any potential effects on the depth and quality of insights, we would like to run a longitudinal study in which participants analyze their own data using the hybrid interface. we suspect performance may improve with long-term use, and sensemaking strategies may change as people feel more engaged with their data. furthermore, it would be interesting to study the use of activeink in collaborative synchronous and asynchronous sensemaking scenarios.",706
Evaluating the Effect of Feedback from Different Computer Vision Processing Stages: A Comparative Lab Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300273,"computer vision and pattern recognition are increasingly being employed by smartphone and tablet applications targeted at lay-users. an open design challenge is to make such systems intelligible without requiring users to become technical experts. this paper reports a lab study examining the role of visual feedback. our findings indicate that the stage of processing from which feedback is derived plays an important role in users' ability to develop coherent and correct understandings of a system's operation. participants in our study showed a tendency to misunderstand the meaning being conveyed by the feedback, relating it to processing outcomes and higher level concepts, when in reality the feedback represented low level features. drawing on the experimental results and the qualitative data collected, we discuss the challenges of designing interactions around pattern matching algorithms. this paper reported a comparative between-groups lab study examining the role of visual feedback in smart camera apps. leveraging a novel experimental design centered on the creation of stop-motion animations, 40 participants were exposed to four different levels of feedback. through a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, our findings indicate a disconnect between user expectations and the information actually represented by the feedback. participants exposed to keypoint marker feedback derived from early stages of processing showed a tendency to misunderstand it and overall they performed worse than participants who received no feedback at all. conversely, participants who received keypoint marker feedback derived from later stages of processing demonstrated an improved understanding of the system operation. we conclude that the stage of processing from which feedback is derived plays an important role in users’ ability to develop coherent and correct understandings of a system’s operation. we hope that the results presented in this paper will inform the design of feedback in smart camera apps, and other applications of pattern recognition. more generally, we hope that our study method can be used by hci researchers in future work exploring the design space of feedback and cues.",707
Smart and Fermented Cities: An Approach to Placemaking in Urban Informatics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300274,"what makes a city meaningful to its residents? what attracts people to live in a city and to care for it? today, we might see such questions as concerns for hci, given the emerging agendas of smart and connected cities, iot, and ubiquitous computing: city residents' perceptions of and attitudes towards smart city technologies will play a role in technology acceptance. theories of ""placemaking"" from humanist geography and urban planning address themselves to such concerns, and they have been taken up in hci and urban informatics research. this theory offers ideas for developing community attachment, heightening the legibility of the city, and intensifying lived experiences in the city. we add to this body of research with an analysis of several initiatives of city yeast, a community-based design collective in taiwan that proposes the metaphor of fermentation as an approach to placemaking. we unpack how this approach shapes their design practice and link its implications to urban informatics research in hci. we suggest that smart cities can also be pursued by leveraging the knowledge of city residents and helping to facilitate their participation in acts of perceiving, envisioning, and improving their local communities, including but not limited to smart and connected technologies. we have shown that many citizens of taipei feel that the city lacks a global identity and that any initiative to make it smart and connected should build on such an identity. in pursuing such an identity collectively, city yeast focuses on exploring current issues in taipei’s urban design and city infrastructure and experimenting with (sometimes symbolic) strategies to redesign taipei for its future. we have also found that citizens fear that smart city technologies – iot, sensors, mobile networks, and so on – comprise a globalgeneric infrastructure. similar to sky-scrapers and modern grocery stores, this new infrastructure threatensthe vibrancy of their city even as it modernizes it. in what follows, we develop our thoughts on how the city yeast approach relates to placemaking by 1) focusing on how smart and connected cities agendas might be joined to an urban identity project as a part of its envisioning and implementation; 2) leveraging the knowledge of city dwellers and helping to facilitate their participation in acts of perceiving, envisioning, and improving their local communities; and 3) ofering design implications for smart city technologists.",708
Smart Home Security Cameras and Shifting Lines of Creepiness: A Design-Led Inquiry,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300275,"through a design-led inquiry focused on smart home security cameras, this research develops three key concepts for research and design pertaining to new and emerging digital consumer technologies. digital leakage names the propensity for digital information to be shared, stolen, and misused in ways unbeknownst or even harmful to those to whom the data pertains or belongs. hole-and-corner applications are those functions connected to users' data, devices, and interactions yet concealed from or downplayed to them, often because they are non-beneficial or harmful to them. foot-in-the-door devices are product and services with functional offerings and affordances that work to normalize and integrate a technology, thus laying groundwork for future adoption of features that might have earlier been rejected as unacceptable or unnecessary. developed and illustrated through a set of design studies and explorations, this paper shows how these concepts may be used analytically to investigate issues such as privacy and security, anticipatorily to speculate about the future of technology development and use, and generatively to synthesize design concepts and solutions. this research set out to investigate shifting and retreating lines of creepiness in the emerging smart home by focusing on smart home security cameras. through a process of closely analyzing existing design interfaces combined with generating novel design scenarios and proposals, this inquiry has developed and illustrated three key concepts: digital leakage, hole-and-corner applications, and foot-in-thedoor devices. this paper has introduced these concepts and shown how they may be used analytically to understand relationships between interactive technology, user experience, and issues of privacy, security, trust, accountable, and fairness. these concepts may also be used anticipatorily and generatively, as this paper has shown, to extrapolate future trends and speculate about future possibilities, and to generate design interventions, solutions, and other design-oriented responses. while this paper makes minor contributions with regards to analyzing, anticipating, and generating specific designs related to smart home security cameras, the core contribution is to develop and present new and refined vocabulary for understanding, discussing, and addressing timely social and ethical issues with smart technologies. this contribution builds upon and adds to theoretical, empirical, and critical scholarship that has proposed similar concepts for understanding issues such as privacy and surveillance—such as nissenbaum’s general theory of contextual integrity [[52]] and zubeff’s concept of surveillance capitalism [[78]]. the three concepts developed in this research, however, are distinct from those developed in prior research in that they both arise from and are directed toward design broadly and interfaces, interactions, and user experiences specifically. these concepts allow us to go beyond generally labeling certain events as creepy, as invasions of privacy, or as breaches of trust by focusing on specific mechanisms by which design and technology lead to negative experiences and outcomes. by expanding our vocabulary through concepts such as digital leakage, holeand-corner applications, and foot-in-the-door devices, we increase our capacity as designers, researchers, and critics to concretely analyze, discuss, debate, and address the dizzying array of existing and emerging issues at hand.",709
Deaf and Hard-of-hearing Individuals' Preferences for Wearable and Mobile Sound Awareness Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300276,"to investigate preferences for mobile and wearable sound awareness systems, we conducted an online survey with 201 dhh participants. the survey explores how demographic factors affect perceptions of sound awareness technologies, gauges interest in specific sounds and sound characteristics, solicits reactions to three design scenarios (smartphone, smartwatch, head-mounted display) and two output modalities (visual, haptic), and probes issues related to social context of use. while most participants were highly interested in being aware of sounds, this interest was modulated by communication preference--that is, for sign or oral communication or both. almost all participants wanted both visual and haptic feedback and 75% preferred to have that feedback on separate devices (e.g., haptic on smartwatch, visual on head-mounted display). other findings related to sound type, full captions vs. keywords, sound filtering, notification styles, and social context provide direct guidance for the design of future mobile and wearable sound awareness systems. we presented an online survey with 201 dhh participants investigating interest in sound awareness and preferences about the design of a mobile or wearable sound awareness technology. this study builds on past work on sound interests [3, 27, 39] to quantitatively examine the influence of demographic factors on interest level. we also specifically examine mobile and wearable form factors and feedback modalities. results show a strong preference for having both haptic and visual feedback, the latter particularly for captions, with the most preferred device design being haptic notifications on a smartwatch and visual information on a head-mounted display or smartphone. finally, our findings surface important cultural and social considerations that will need to be addressed for the successful adoption of mobile or wearable sound awareness technologies, such as a hesitance to use a sound awareness device with strangers or around deaf friends or family.",710

A Practice-Led Account of the Conceptual Evolution of UX Knowledge,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300279,"the contours of user experience (ux) design practice have been shaped by a diverse array of practitioners and disciplines, resulting in a diffuse and decentralized body of ux-specific disciplinary knowledge. the rapidly shifting space that ux knowledge occupies, in conjunction with a long-existing research-practice gap, presents unique challenges and opportunities to ux educators and aspiring ux designers. in this paper, we analyzed a corpus of question and answer communication on ux stack exchange using a practice-led approach, identifying and documenting practitioners' conceptions of ux knowledge over a nine year period. specifically, we used natural language processing techniques and qualitative content analysis to identify a disciplinary vocabulary invoked by ux designers in this online community, as well as conceptual trajectories spanning over nine years which could shed light on the evolution of ux practice. we further describe the implications of our findings for hci research and ux education. in this paper, we performed a mixed-methods analysis of ux practitioner conversations on stack exchange, using a combination of content analysis and natural language processing to build a preliminary vocabulary of ux knowledge. our analysis revealed a diverse array of knowledge types and concepts that emerged from a complex set of disciplinary sources, and a promising set of methods that could be used to further probe the dynamic nature of design knowledge in online communities. the approach to bubbling up ux knowledge is inherently generative in opening up new spaces for both methodological discussions and practical applications in education and pedagogy. along this direction, we are able to ask broader questions such as how qualitative data analysis might productively be used alongside big data techniques, and how sources of big data such as social media conversations might be efectively utilized to guide future educational innovation.",713
Understanding Visual Cues in Visualizations Accompanied by Audio Narrations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300280,"it is often assumed that visual cues, which highlight specific parts of a visualization to guide the audience's attention, facilitate visualization storytelling and presentation. this assumption has not been systematically studied. we present an in-lab experiment and a mechanical turk study to examine the effects of integral and separable visual cues on the recall and comprehension of visualizations that are accompanied by audio narration. eye-tracking data in the in-lab experiment confirm that cues helped the viewers focus on relevant parts of the visualization faster. we found that in general, visual cues did not have a significant effect on learning outcomes, but for specific cue techniques (e.g. glow) or specific chart types (e.g heatmap), cues significantly improved comprehension. based on these results, we discuss how presenters might select visual cues depending on the role of the cues and the visualization type. we studied visual cues’ effectiveness and user preference by in-lab and online studies. the results show that visual cues may not lead to a significant improvement on people’s recall and comprehension of the visualizations with audio narration, but can help people focus on the relevant regions faster. we also found an inconsistency between the perceived effectiveness and the actual effectiveness of visual cues showing that people’s intuition on visual cues may not be accurate. based on the results of our study, we propose different factors presenters should consider when choosing a visual cue including the role of the cue, the visual characteristics of the cued region, and the visual characteristics and the type of the visualization.",714
Context-Informed Scheduling and Analysis: Improving Accuracy of Mobile Self-Reports,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300281,"mobile self-reports are a popular technique to collect participant labelled data in the wild. while literature has focused on increasing participant compliance to self-report questionnaires, relatively little work has assessed response accuracy. in this paper, we investigate how participant context can affect response accuracy and help identify strategies to improve the accuracy of mobile self-report data. in a 3-week study we collect over 2,500 questionnaires containing both verifiable and non-verifiable questions. we find that response accuracy is higher for questionnaires that arrive when the phone is not in ongoing or very recent use. furthermore, our results show that long completion times are an indicator of a lower accuracy. using contextual mechanisms readily available on smartphones, we are able to explain up to 13% of the variance in participant accuracy. we offer actionable recommendations to assist researchers in their future deployments of mobile self-report studies. as researchers utilising self-report methods rely heavily on the answers provided by their participants, measuring and improving response accuracy is an important research avenue. through a questionnaire assessing participants’ performance across a set of questions (recall, working memory, arithmetic) we identify contextual and study-wide factors affecting participant accuracy. our results show that a short survey completion time did not correlate with a low response accuracy in our questionnaire items. in fact, surveys that took a long time to complete were more likely to be inaccurate. furthermore, we find that contextual usage factors such as phone usage at the time of questionnaire arrival and the number of recent phone interactions influence participant accuracy. these contextual factors can be used to optimise questionnaire scheduling for improved data accuracy. we offer actionable recommendations to assist researchers in their future deployments of self-report studies. cognition-aware scheduling provides a novel scheduling technique, which can best be used in combination with traditional esm scheduling techniques (time or event-based) to reduce contextual bias. with an increased shift of experience sampling to the observation of external and verifiable phenomena [8, 11], we expect an increased focus on ensuring accuracy of responses in experience sampling.",715
BBeep: A Sonic Collision Avoidance System for Blind Travellers and Nearby Pedestrians,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300282,"we present an assistive suitcase system, bbeep, for supporting blind people when walking through crowded environments. bbeep uses pre-emptive sound notifications to help clear a path by alerting both the user and nearby pedestrians about the potential risk of collision. bbeep triggers notifications by tracking pedestrians, predicting their future position in real-time, and provides sound notifications only when it anticipates a future collision. we investigate how different types and timings of sound affect nearby pedestrian behavior. in our experiments, we found that sound emission timing has a significant impact on nearby pedestrian trajectories when compared to different sound types. based on these findings, we performed a real-world user study at an international airport, where blind participants navigated with the suitcase in crowded areas. we observed that the proposed system significantly reduces the number of imminent collisions. we proposed an assistive suitcase system, bbeep, that aimsto clear the path for blind users when walking through crowded spaces, by notifying both the user and sighted pedestrians about the risks of collision. it provides sound notifcations only when needed, based on pedestrian tracking and by predicting their future position in real-time. we frst investigated how to convey the sound feedback efectively to sighted pedestrians and designed the sonic notifcation interface of bbeep. then, we conducted a real-world user study with visually impaired people in an airport. results showed that bbeep reduces the number of situations of imminent collision risk when compared to notifying the blind user alone. moreover, users found bbeep acceptable and appropriate to use in crowded, public spaces such as airports, train stations or shopping malls. yet, they were more hesitant about using it in places they are supposed to be quiet. in the future, we plan to extend our collision prediction method, by using vision-based attention analysis to reduce the number of unnecessary sound emissions when the pedestrians have already noticed the presence of the blind user.",716
From Gender Biases to Gender-Inclusive Design: An Empirical Investigation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300283,"in recent years, research has revealed gender biases in numerous software products. but although some researchers have found ways to improve gender participation in specific software projects, general methods focus mainly on detecting gender biases -- not fixing them. to help fill this gap, we investigated whether the gendermag bias detection method can lead directly to designs with fewer gender biases. in our 3-step investigation, two hci researchers analyzed an industrial software product using gendermag; we derived design changes to the product using the biases they found; and ran an empirical study of participants using the original product versus the new version. the results showed that using the method in this way did improve the software's inclusiveness: women succeeded more often in the new version than in the original; men's success rates improved too; and the gender gap entirely disappeared. in this paper, we have presented the first investigation into whether and how an hci method to detect gender biases in software can generate more gender-inclusive designs. the method our study investigated was gendermag; it was beyond the scope of this study to compare gendermag with other usability inspection methods, or to generalize our results to other contexts. also, other factors such as income, age, race, gender identification factors such as those discussed in [52], and algorithmic biases can influence software equity, and gendermag does not address these. that said, in our setting, gendermag alone did lead to more inclusive and more usable designs, as our results show. specifically: • improved designs in total: participants in the postgendermag condition, who used the design changes derived from the gendermag analyses, were more successful on almost every individual task than original participants. in total, the post-gendermag participants failed less than half as often as participants in the original version. • accurately found issues: in 100% of the cases where analysts found an issue using gendermag, the issue happened to one or more participants in the original condition. further, in most of the cases, the participants experiencing the issues had the facet values analysts predicted. • the facets pointed to the fixes: the method we used to achieve these results was to use the facets identified in step 1 as starting points for creating the fixes (step 2). the results suggest that this gendermag-based sequence offers an effective, pre-user-study method to pinpoint and fix issues affecting gender- and cognitive-inclusivity. • from gender biases to gender-inclusiveness: after the design changes, the original version’s gender gap in participants’ failure rates entirely disappeared. the results also illuminate the nuanced relationships between individual cognitive styles and gender. as such, the results have several direct implications for gender-inclusive design. first, designing for cognitive diversity improves software’s gender inclusiveness. second, it is neither necessary nor desirable to devise two (or more) genderlabeled versions of the same software to serve different genders. finally, many gender biases in software are cognitive biases, and many cognitive biases in software are gender biases. thus, software designs that better support cognitive diversity also better support gender diversity—and improve the software for everyone.",717
"How to Work in the Car of the Future?: A Neuroergonomical Study Assessing Concentration, Performance and Workload Based on Subjective, Behavioral and Neurophysiological Insights",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300284,"autonomous driving provides new opportunities for the use of time during a car ride. one such important scenario is working. we conducted a neuroergonomical study to compare three configurations of a car interior (based on lighting, visual stimulation, sound) regarding their potential to support productive work. we assessed participants? concentration, performance and workload with subjective, behavioral and eeg measures while they carried out two different concentration tasks during simulated autonomous driving. our results show that a configuration with a large-area, bright light with high blue components, and reduced visual and auditory stimuli promote performance, quality, efficiency, increased concentration and lower cognitive workload. increased visual and auditory stimulation paired with linear, darker light with very few blue components resulted in lower performance, reduced subjective concentration, and higher cognitive workload, but did not differ from a normal car configuration. our multi-method approach thus reveals possible car interior configurations for an ideal workspace. our neuroergonomical study shows that self-driving cars have the potential to serve as a workplace and that the interior design of light, sound and visual stimulation can be configured to support concentrated working. the multimethod approach helped us examine possible interior design set-ups and to come up with a holistic picture on the influences on concentration and workload. our results are cumulative, which increases their robustness and extends our understanding of the constructs under investigation. we proposed three different variants of interior configurations for a workplace in a self-driving car and setup a driving simulator. we designed an experimental study that allowed us to investigate to what extent these configurations support a productive working style. the lc features relaxing light and enables the passenger to receive notifications and media content from their mobile phone on the interactive window screens of the car, thus combining the task of working with a more leisure-oriented environment. our study shows that in this environment, subjective concentration, behavioral performance, and cognitive workload are comparable to the nc, the regular set-up of a car with standard lighting, traffic sound and a few visual distractors. the third interior variant (cc) was designed to deliberately boost the passenger’s concentration and productivity with an activating lighting concept, blurred window screens and reduced environmental sounds. the results of our study indicate that participants did indeed perform better in this set-up, while their perceived workload and actual cognitive workload were significantly lower than for the other design variants. the cc may be used as a guideline on how to adjust certain configurations in future autonomous cars in order to make them productive workplaces. by understanding the relationship between car configuration modes and cognitive workload, car manufacturers can design future interiors that adequately address human cognitive limitations, skills, and needs by providing optimal working conditions. to arrive at this conclusion, we used a multi-method approach combining subjective evaluation based on a questionnaire, behavioral measures capturing rts and error rates, and eeg recordings assessing neurophysiological processes in the brain. the results of our study show that these methods complement each other well and, taken together, can provide a holistic picture about a participant’s experience and cognitive state in the context of working in an automotive setting. the study presented in this work should be regarded as a first step towards concrete design propositions for using cars as mobile offices. we ensured that - although being placed in a mock-up car - in all three configurations participants had the impression of being in an automated car (level 5). thus, we offer an ecologically valid setup for inducing different mental workload and concentration levels by manipulating the interior design configuration. we based our design variants on the configuration of light, sound and visual stimulation. this is, quite obviously, only a subset of the interior features that can be configured. future studies can build upon our initial design propositions and include other aspects such as temperature or seating configuration. interestingly, we found that the leisure-oriented set-up did not have a negative effect on participant’s concentration, performance or workload. still, in this study, the display of notifications and media on the interactive window screens was limited to a medium level. for future studies, it would be interesting to investigate the threshold of the amount of displayed media content for causing a cognitive overload and consequently impeding productive work. the next big step for future research would be to take this, and similar work out of the lab, and apply it to real-world scenarios. in our case, this might entail conducting similar investigations with more realistic office tasks and ultimately apply our findings to commercial self-driving cars. there are also attempts to improve real-time cognitive state assessment with neurophysiological measures and integrate respective sensors in the car interior [39]. this research fuels the design of adaptive in-car interfaces that are able to tailor interior configurations to the individual passenger based on data recorded during the car ride. for working scenarios, eeg-based quantification of workload, as demonstrated in our study, may become a valuable technique. the idea of a system adapting to the individual based on the current cognitive workload requires a robust estimation and user model that collects relevant information about the user during runtime. our study provides an initial evidence that eeg is a valid approach to disentangle context-based influences on user’s mental workload capacities. we will therefore promote future research on real-time cognitive state assessment based on eeg for adaptive lighting conditions as well as visual and auditory information displays.",718
Sensing Posture-Aware Pen+Touch Interaction on Tablets,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300285,"many status-quo interfaces for tablets with pen + touch input capabilities force users to reach for device-centric ui widgets at fixed locations, rather than sensing and adapting to the user-centric posture. to address this problem, we propose sensing techniques that transition between various nuances of mobile and stationary use via postural awareness. these postural nuances include shifting hand grips, varying screen angle and orientation, planting the palm while writing or sketching, and detecting what direction the hands approach from. to achieve this, our system combines three sensing modalities: 1) raw capacitance touchscreen images, 2) inertial motion, and 3) electric field sensors around the screen bezel for grasp and hand proximity detection. we show how these sensors enable posture-aware pen+touch techniques that adapt interaction and morph user interface elements to suit fine-grained contexts of body-, arm-, hand-, and grip-centric frames of reference. overall, our work demonstrates how posture awareness can adapt interaction, and morph user interface elements, to suit the fine-grained context of use for pen and touch interaction on tablets. posture-awareness includes nuances of grip, the angle of the tablet, the presence and orientation of the palm on the screen while writing or sketching, and which direction the user reaches onto the screen from during touch. taken together, these contributions show how a few simple sensors can enable tablets to more effectively support both ‘mobile’ and ‘stationary’ use—and the many gradations in-between.",719

Painting with CATS: Camera-Aided Texture Synthesis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300287,"we present cats, a digital painting system that synthesizes textures from live video in real-time, short-cutting the typical brush- and texture- gathering workflow. through the use of boundary-aware texture synthesis, cats produces strokes that are non-repeating and blend smoothly with each other. this allows cats to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. we evaluated the effectiveness of cats by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that cats is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings. we have presented cats, a novel digital painting system that synthesizes texture from live video in real time. by capturing textures from live video, cats accelerates the texture creation workflow and encourages an exploratory approach to painting. user study results demonstrate that artists could produce texture rich paintings that could not easily be made through purely digital or traditional means. this opens an exciting new avenue for using computation to facilitate the creative process and produce new materials for art creation.",721
A Comparison of Notification Techniques for Out-of-View Objects in Full-Coverage Displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300288,"full-coverage displays can place visual content anywhere on the interior surfaces of a room (e.g., a weather display near the coat stand). in these settings, digital artefacts can be located behind the user and out of their field of view - meaning that it can be difficult to notify the user when these artefacts need attention. although much research has been carried out on notification, little is known about how best to direct people to the necessary location in room environments. we designed five diverse attention-guiding techniques for full-coverage display rooms, and evaluated them in a study where participants completed search tasks guided by the different techniques. our study provides new results about notification in full-coverage displays: we showed benefits of persistent visualisations that could be followed all the way to the target and that indicate distance-to-target. our findings provide useful information for improving the usability of interactive full-coverage environments. many of the digital objects in a full-coverage display environment may be behind the user, and therefore out of view. when these objects need attention, it can be difficult for the system to notify the user and lead them to the correct object at the back of the environment. although much research has been done on notification in general, little is known about how best to direct people to out-of-view locations in fcds. to address this problem, we designed four attention-guiding techniques that take different approaches on several different design dimensions. we evaluated these techniques in a controlled study that simulated a realistic attention-demanding task in an fcd. the study showed that the wedge technique performed best, but also showed how the fundamental differences between the guiding techniques led to several performance differences. our findings provide designers with useful new information that can improve the effectiveness and usability of interactive full-coverage environments.",722
An Evaluation of Radar Metaphors for Providing Directional Stimuli Using Non-Verbal Sound,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300289,"we compared four audio-based radar metaphors for providing directional stimuli to users of ar headsets. the metaphors are clock face, compass, white noise, and scale. each metaphor, or method, signals the movement of a virtual arm in a radar sweep. in a user study, statistically significant differences were observed for accuracy and response time. beat-based methods (clock face, compass) elicited responses biased to the left of the stimulus location, and non-beat-based methods (white noise, scale) produced responses biased to the right of the stimulus location. the beat methods were more accurate than the non-beat methods. however, the non-beat methods elicited quicker responses. we also discuss how response accuracy varies along the radar sweep between methods. these observations contribute design insights for non-verbal, non-visual directional prompting. on average, participants were able to perceive location stimulus to within 13° across all methods. with the compass method, this improved to below 10°. beat-based delineations had better accuracy when identifying location stimulus. non-beat-based delineations (using constant tones) elicited quicker responses from participants. there was a disparity between user preference and accuracy for beat-based methods, with participants preferring fewer delineations in the radar sweep. if accuracy is flexible, designers of radar metaphors should consider exploring non-beat-based methods of delineation to reduce cognitive load. there was variation between participants in both performance and preference for each method. this suggests providing options to personalize a radar sweep system to the method users are most comfortable with would be helpful, but (without further work) at the expense of accuracy in some cases. participants with musical training performed better in all areas than those without. they were quicker and more accurate. this suggests that others who have enhanced auditory skills may also perform well, and this gives encouragement to the idea that visuallyimpaired users could find these metaphors useful. investigation into the effect of multiple location stimuli on a single radar arm is the next step towards creating a metaphor that can provide a bigger picture of the user’s surroundings rather than a single location stimulus. it is possible that a method that works well for a single location stimulus breaks down when it is used with multiple stimuli. similarly, methods that performed less well with a single stimulus may better support multiple prompts. the stimulus location tasks in this study were all conducted in isolation, further work could also include simultaneous tasks to assess the effects of additional cognitive load on accuracy of sweep methods. there is also the possibility to investigate how well a user can identify and distinguish different types of location stimuli, for example, using a different timbre for each location stimulus. integration of effects, such as low-pass filters, could help encode extra information, such as proximity to objects. this has been used before effectively in other location stimuli systems [7]. adjusting cutoff/resonance of the radar delineation sound could also be useful in conveying information such as proximity to walls. further work with different participant groups will also help provide insight into the preferences of each groups, for example, with children or visually-impaired people. this study was a lab-based study carried out on a laptop. another logical extension to the work is to implement the appropriate radar methods on an ar headset and evaluate with live spatial mapping data.",723
Integrated Workflows: Generating Feedback Between Digital and Physical Realms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290605.3300290,"as design thinking shifted away from conventional methods with the rapid adoption of computer-aided design and fabrication technologies, architects have been seeking ways to initiate a comprehensive dialogue between the virtual and the material realms. current methodologies do not offer embodied workflows that utilize the feedback obtained through a subsequent transition process between physical and digital design. therefore, narrowing the separation between these two platforms remains as a research problem. this literature review elaborates the divide between physical and digital design, testing and manufacturing techniques in the morphological process of architectural form. we first review the digital transformation in the architectural design discourse. then, we proceed by introducing a variety of methods that are integrating digital and physical workflows and suggesting an alternative approach. our work unveils that there is a need for empirical research with a focus on integrated approaches to create intuitively embodied experiences for architectural designers. we have provided an overview of the widening divide between the digital and physical manipulations in the architectural design process, starting from the 2d drafting era to the modern digital design and fabrication techniques. we have introduced critical ideas towards the rapid digitalization and discussed the significance of physical model making for architectural designers. our review unveils that, despite the growing number of computational methods, materialization and physical input of the designer remain as a fundamental accelerator for the evolutionary process of architectural form. the sources we have included predominantly follow a linear and non-iterative transition between physical and digital workflows. thus, there is an open area that requires further experimentation and testing with fluid feedbackbased integrated workflows. as future work, we will be further exploring the physical interactions with scanned 3d models to create manipulable 3d settings for architectural designers based on the theoretical background presented in this paper and the transitional method we have suggested in the end. to strengthen the feasibility of our transitional method we will be implementing efficient scanning settings [93]. we also plan to enhance the algorithmic transition phase with accurate translation approaches [83,105]. findings of these empirical studies can assist us for designing an iterative loop process between the physical and digital realities. once we are able to reduce the contradiction between virtual and real-world interaction, we will test our integrated method with architectural designers to determine its impact starting from the early creative stages of the design and form-finding processes. by improving our transitional approach, we will be aiming to replace the distorted creative thinking with a multidimensional comprehension of digital design and fabrication tools.",724
Introducing Peripheral Awareness as a Neurological State for Human-computer Integration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376128,"in this work we introduce peripheral awareness as a neurological state for real-time human-computer integration, where the human is assisted by a computer to interact with the world. changes to the field of view in peripheral awareness have been linked with quality of human performance. this instinctive narrowing of vision that occurs as a threat is perceived has implications in activities that benefit from the user having a wide field of view, such as cycling to navigate the environment. we present ""ena"", a novel eeg-ebike system that draws from the user's neural activity to determine when the user is in a state of peripheral awareness to regulate engine support. a study with 20 participants revealed various themes and tactics suggesting that peripheral awareness as a neurological state is viable to align human-machine integration with internal bodily processes. ena suggests that our work facilitates a safe and enjoyable human-computer integration experience. prior work in hci has not yet studied changes to the user’s field of view in relation to peripheral awareness via the user’s neural activity. peripheral awareness can influence how much we see, our thinking processes that hinder or support creativity, human performance and the resulting decisions we make. as such, this link between peripheral awareness and our interactions with the world is of paramount importance to the hci community. to take the first steps to begin filling this gap in knowledge and further our field, we orchestrated and studied a system outside of the lab, in a real world setting, using peripheral awareness as neurological state via eeg in real-time—the changes in the user’s field of view were used to create an integration between the user and an electric bike, which regulated engine support according to whether or not the user was in a state of peripheral awareness. by drawing directly from the user’s neurological activity while navigating the environment, our system was able to access and react to the user’s pre-attentive processing state to support the user experience. in this first-of-a-kind approach in hci, we offer a detailed system implementation description, including reusable code, practical themes and tactics resulting from a study with 20 bike riders to study and design integration experiences that use peripheral awareness as a neurological state. potential future work includes an invitation for the field to explore aligning interactive experiences with internal bodily processes, such as peripheral awareness, to inform, design and afford a greater benefit to people.",725

BlyncSync: Enabling Multimodal Smartwatch Gestures with Synchronous Touch and Blink,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376132,"input techniques have been drawing abiding attention along with the continual miniaturization of personal computers. in this paper, we present blyncsync, a novel multi-modal gesture set that leverages the synchronicity of touch and blink events to augment the input vocabulary of smartwatches with a rapid gesture, while at the same time, offers a solution to the false activation problem of blink-based input. blyncsync contributes the concept of a mutual delimiter, where two modalities are used to jointly delimit the intention of each other's input. a study shows that blyncsync is 33% faster than using a baseline input delimiter (physical smartwatch button), with only 150ms in overhead cost compared to traditional touch events. furthermore, our data indicates that the gesture can be tuned to elicit a true positive rate of 97% and a false positive rate of 1.68%. we have presented blyncsync, a set of multi-modal smartwatch gestures that were designed as input delimiters for both touch and eye input. our work introduces the concept of mutual delimiters and offers a design space of touch & blink gestures. our experiments showed that the blyncsync gestures are resistant to false positives, while still achieving high true positive rates. since blyncsync is easy to perform and unlikely to be accidentally invoked, it provides an always-active input method for smartwatch interaction. based on the study results, we further provide insights to the trade-off of selecting activation thresholds, which could enable deployments of blyncsync within commercial products. furthermore, since the synchronous touch and eye events serve as mutual delimiters, blyncsync spans a unique application space that covers both smartwatch interaction and gaze input, as demonstrated by our sample applications. we hope our technique will serve as important groundwork for future work on multimodal wearable input.",729
Making Space for Social Sharing: Insights from a Community-Based Social Group for People with Dementia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376133,"people with dementia face major challenges in maintaining active social interaction. designing digital tools for social sharing within families and care facilities has been well explored by hci research, but comparatively less work has considered community settings. situated in a community-based program for storytelling and socializing, our field observations and semi-structured interviews with people living with early-middle stage dementia, family caregivers, and program facilitators illustrate both positive and challenging aspects of social activities. we contribute a nuanced understanding of participants' social lives and identify four factors that aid in achieving positive outcomes: effective agencies for social interaction, normalized and friendly environments, collaboration and teamwork, and mediating social cues and communication. finally, we examine our findings through the lens of past hci work and offer insights for designing new social technologies to diversify the range of social spaces in community settings, through expanding peer collaboration, leveraging physical and virtual spaces, creating open-ended experiences, and developing flexible platforms. our recent fieldwork in the tales & travels storytelling and social program, distinctive in its community setting, reveals the potential to diversify social sharing spaces for people with dementia, thus informing the design of new social technologies. on the basis of thematic analysis on interview transcripts and observation notes, we propose to further community-based peer collaboration and balance the tension between co-located and technology-mediated spaces. we suggest richer content, more open-ended structures, and synchronized creating and sharing processes, diversifying the roles of people with dementia in social interaction. we further discuss developing more flexible social platforms to offer person-centered yet inclusive activities.",730
Phasking on Paper: Accessing a Continuum of PHysically Assisted SKetchING,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376134,"when sketching, we must choose between paper (expressive ease, ruler and eraser) and computational assistance (parametric support, a digital record). physically assisted sketching provides both, with a pen that displays force constraints with which the sketcher interacts as they draw on paper. phasking provides passive, ""bound"" constraints (like a ruler); or actively ""brings"" the sketcher along a commanded path (e.g., a curve), which they can violate for creative variation. the sketcher modulates constraint strength (control sharing) by bearing down on the pen-tip. phasking requires untethered, graded force-feedback, achieved by modifying a ballpoint drive that generates force through rolling surface contact. to understand phasking's viability, we implemented its interaction concepts, related them to sketching tasks and measured device performance. we assessed the experience of 10 sketchers, who could understand, use and delight in phasking, and who valued its control-sharing and digital twinning for productivity, creative control and learning to draw. our evaluations indicate that this prototype was sufficient to assess phasking’s potential. the concept found an enthusiastic reception, and feedback points to key improvements. with a full interactive experience in place, we have proved possible many other interesting functions within this framework, including modifying elements (e.g., resize, rotate, amend) as well as copy, paste, undo; identifying free-drawn marks as parametric objects; combining objects into a virtual construct, and even simulating dynamic virtual systems. it is a small straightforward step to full digital twinning: modify it onscreen then bring it back to paper with guided tracing. phasking is too different from other digital tools to know its full potential. being untethered, portable and self-contained, phasking pen can, with attainable modifications, be used on arbitrary surfaces. this could lead to a new way of ‘drawing on a napkin’, support blind mobility by revealing maps on a corridor wall, and allow drawing and playing with simulations on a whiteboard – an ‘object to think with’ [28, 30].",731
Peer-to-Peer Energy Markets: Understanding the Values of Collective and Community Trading,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376135,"peer-to-peer energy-trading platforms (p2p) have the potential to transform the current energy system. however, research is presently scarce on how people would like to participate in, and what would they expect to gain from, such platforms. we address this gap by exploring these questions in the context of the uk energy market. using a qualitative interview study, we examine how 45 people with an interest in renewable energy understand p2p. we find that the prospective users value the collective benefits of p2p, and understand participation as a mechanism to support social, ecological and economic benefits for communities and larger groups. drawing on the findings from the interview analysis, we explore broad design characteristics that a prospective p2p energy trading platform should provide to meet the expectations and concerns voiced by our study participants. we extend hci research examining p2p energy markets by analyzing how prospective users understand, value and seek to engage in these platforms, with a focus on members of the public who have a pre-existing interest in renewable energy. our participants valued experiences that enable communities to organize around shared values, build an understanding of p2p platforms and the ways that trading impacts the environment, and to configure their own selective engagement with business models and broader energy infrastructure. our analysis emphasizes the importance of nurturing and supporting groups within p2p energy-trading platforms, particularly for populations who already have an interest and engagement with renewable energy. likewise, our findings are consistent with existing research that highlights the need for autonomy, control and economic equality in these markets. more broadly, our research speaks to examinations of the sharing economy, we bring together research that emphasizes the social dimensions of sharing with calls to examine the social justice implications of sharing-economy applications. specifically, we outline how users can harness groups to advance sustainability aims and how platforms can provide infrastructure and opportunities to support these efforts. thus, our contributions can provide insights for the hci community, private companies and policy makers in developing p2p energy markets.",732
AirTouch: 3D-printed Touch-Sensitive Objects Using Pneumatic Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376136,"3d printing technology can be used to rapidly prototype the look and feel of 3d objects. however, the objects produced are passive. there has been increasing interest in making these objects interactive, yet they often require assembling components or complex calibration. in this paper, we contribute airtouch, a technique that enables designers to fabricate touch-sensitive objects with minimal assembly and calibration using pneumatic sensing. airtouch-enabled objects are 3d printed as a single structure using a consumer-level 3d printer. airtouch uses pre-trained machine learning models to identify interactions with fabricated objects, meaning that there is no calibration required once the object has completed printing. we evaluate our technique using fabricated objects with various geometries and touch sensitive locations, obtaining accuracies of at least 90% with 12 interactive locations. in this paper we introduced airtouch: a technique for fabricating touch-sensitive objects without the need of any postprint activities such as assembly or calibration. we presented the theory behind airtouch, our explorations of parameters for both interaction and successful fabrication, and guidelines for designing airtouch-enabled objects. we illustrated airtouch’s flexibility with several applications, and showed that airtouch is able to identify interactions with accuracies of at least 91% with 12 interactive locations.",733
Digital Liminalities: Understanding Isolated Communities on the Edge,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376137,"this paper brings together three distinct case studies to explore how social isolation and notions of liminality shape ontological security within communities on ""the edge"" of society. each case study exemplifies the differing nature of liminality in everyday contexts and the extent to which increased digitalisation perturbs it in multiple ways. taking an ethnographic approach, the research engaged with seafarers onboard container ships in european waters, communities in greenland and welfare claimants in the north east of england. it posits that technological innovation must attend to the routinisation of everyday life through which people establish ontological security if such innovation is to be supportive. the paper thus moves beyond existing hci scholarship by foregrounding the contextual and relational aspects of social isolation rather than the technological. it does so by advocating a ground-up design process that considers ontological security in relation to notions of liminality among communities on the edge. grounding our findings in three distinct communities on the edge of society, we have shown how social isolation and feelings of security are interwoven and shape digital interactions. the three case studies also highlight the differing nature of liminality in everyday contexts and how spaces “between” connected and disconnected – and transitions between the two – perturbs everyday routines needed for the individual to establish ontological security. we have suggested how the hci community can support digital design that attends to people’s sense of security and experience of liminality. this can be done by designing interventions and community-led engagements that attend to wider social, political economic and geographical aspects shaping social isolation. we see this paper as a starting point for a wider programme of engagements with communities experiencing social isolation on the edge of society, focusing on their sense of collective and individual security. we posit that the hci community is uniquely positioned to lead such a programme.",734
Mouillé: Exploring Wetness Illusion on Fingertips to Enhance Immersive Experience in VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376138,"providing users with rich sensations is beneficial to enhance their immersion in virtual reality (vr) environments. wetness is one such imperative sensation that affects users' sense of comfort and helps users adjust grip force when interacting with objects. researchers have recently begun to explore ways to create wetness illusions, primarily on a user's face or body skin. in this work, we extended this line of research by creating wetness illusion on users' fingertips. we first conducted a user study to understand the effect of thermal and tactile feedback on users' perceived wetness sensation. informed by the findings, we designed and evaluated a prototype---mouillé---that provides various levels of wetness illusions on fingertips for both hard and soft items when users squeeze, lift, or scratch it. study results indicated that users were able to feel wetness with different levels of temperature changes and they were able to distinguish three levels of wetness for simulated vr objects. we further presented applications that simulated an ice cube, an iced cola bottle, and a wet sponge, etc, to demonstrate its use in vr. in this work, we first conducted a study to understand how temperature, pressure, and friction affect people’s wetness perception on fingertips using simulated dry-stimuli. informed by the findings, we designed and implemented a prototype— mouillé—that allows vr users to experience wetness on their fingertips. we conducted a user study in which vr users interacted with four wet virtual objects that were of different stiffness by squeezing, lifting, or scratching mouillé. the results showed that users were able to feel different types of wetness with different levels of temperature changes and ways of interaction. moreover, they were also able to distinguish three levels of wetness for each each type of wetness on a vr object (i.e., ice cube, coke bottle, sponge, and glass table). in sum, we found that temperature change is key to generating wetness illusions; pressure and friction could further enhance such perception if only they are carefully designed to not override the wetness sensation. mouillé took a step further to enhance vr users’ immersive experiences by providing them with simulated wetness sensation to their fingertips with dry stimuli. we have discussed the factors (e.g., weight and surface textual of the prototype, the duration of the wetness illusions, individual difference) that should be examined to enhance wetness experience in vr.",735
Replicate and Reuse: Tangible Interaction Design for Digitally-Augmented Physical Media Objects,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376139,"technology has transformed our physical interactions into infinitely more scalable and flexible digital ones. we can peruse an infinite number of photos, news articles, and books. however, these digital experiences lack the physical experience of paging through an album, reading a newspaper, or meandering through a bookshelf. overlaying physical objects with digital content using augmented reality is a promising avenue towards bridging this gap. in this paper, we investigate the interaction design for such digital-overlaid physical objects and their varying levels of tangibility. we first conduct a user evaluation of a physical photo album that uses tangible interactions to support physical and digital operations. we further prototype multiple objects including bookshelves and newspapers and probe users on their usage, capabilities, and interactions. we then conduct a qualitative investigation of three interaction designs with varying tangibility that use three different input modalities. finally, we discuss the insights from our investigations and recommend design guidelines. we investigated the interaction design questions pertaining to using a single physical media object to provide the physical experience for all corresponding digital content. we define the design problem, and build a wholly-tangible physical album prototype, plus several other prototypes including a bookshelf, newspaper, research paper, card-deck, and jigsaw-puzzle. we conducted a study that informed us on their utility and on the use of the wholly-tangible physical album. we further conducted a second study that compared three modalities of input and analyzed the trade-offs between tangibility, usability, and enjoyment. finally, we summarized the design insights and discussed future directions. the reinstrumentation of physical objects for digital purposes is emerging as a strong direction for augmented reality applications. we believe our work opens a dialogue in this space on how to bring back our physical experiences while retaining the digital scale and flexibility.",736
FDHelper: Assist Unsupervised Fraud Detection Experts with Interactive Feature Selection and Evaluation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376140,"online fraud is the well-known dark side of the modern internet. unsupervised fraud detection algorithms are widely used to address this problem. however, selecting features, adjusting hyperparameters, evaluating the algorithms, and eliminating false positives all require human expert involvement. in this work, we design and implement an end-to-end interactive visualization system, fdhelper, based on the deep understanding of the mechanism of the black market and fraud detection algorithms. we identify a workflow based on experience from both fraud detection algorithm experts and domain experts. using a multi-granularity three-layer visualization map embedding an entropy-based distance metric coldis, analysts can interactively select different feature sets, refine fraud detection algorithms, tune parameters and evaluate the detection result in near real-time. we demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of fdhelper through two case studies with state-of-the-art fraud detection algorithms, interviews with domain experts and algorithm experts, and a user study with eight first-time end users. in this work, we presented fdhelper, an interactive visualization tool that supports fraud detection algorithm experts to fine-tune the weights and features timely. the workflow of using fdhelper was proposed based on the deep understanding of the requirements of both algorithm experts and domain experts. the three key designs in the workflow - choosing the algorithm and dataset, refining the feature selection and algorithm setting, and evaluating the detection result - are identified to guide the implementation of fdhelper. it brings the controllability, readability, and dependability to visual fraud detection. we next propose a multi-granularity three-layer visualization map with in-situ configuration to enable users to refine and check a fraud detection progress in time from the algorithm level, feature level, and the hyperparameter level. fdhelper works for fine-tuning both supervised algorithms and unsupervised algorithms. we also prove the efficiency through two real-world datasets and two state-of-the-art algorithms respectively. to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first interactive visual fraud detection system based on the grouping behavior of online fraud users. we hope this work can inspire both algorithm experts and visualization researchers on the subject of interactive fraud detection.",737
Understanding Walking Meetings: Drivers and Barriers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376141,"there is increased interest in reducing sedentary behavior of office workers to combat the negative health effects of prolonged sitting. walking meetings offer a promising solution to this problem as they facilitate a physically active way of working. to inform future development of technologies supporting these type of meetings, in-depth qualitative insights into people's experiences of walking meetings are needed. we conducted semi-structured walking interviews (n=16) to identify key drivers and barriers for walking meetings in a living lab setting by using the 'workwalk'. the 'workwalk' is a 1.8 km walking route indicated by a dotted blue line with outdoor meeting points, integrated into the room booking system. our findings provide insights into how walking meetings are experienced and affect the set-up and social dynamics of meetings. we offer design recommendations for the development of future technologies and service design elements to support walking meetings and active ways of working. walking meetings are an adequate means to integrate physical activity within office work. our research shows how design can facilitate the uptake and adoption of walking meetings. we offer an in-depth qualitative understanding of the drivers and barriers associated with walking meetings, revealing the social implications and variance of this practice. the deployment of the workwalk allowed us to find different scenarios and recommendations for walking meetings that could be used as a basis to redesign the workplace. this study sets the stage for future hci research explorations and the development of supporting technologies for walking meetings and other active ways of working. challenging current work paradigms allows us to rethink the office environment, the relations within that space, and improve these environments to increase efficiency, effectiveness and overall quality of work life. let us take inspiration from great philosophers such as nietzsche who said, “all truly great thoughts are conceived while walking” and follow their thread.",738
Listen to Developers! A Participatory Design Study on Security Warnings for Cryptographic APIs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376142,"the positive effect of security information communicated to developers through api warnings has been established. however, current prototypical designs are based on security warnings for end-users. to improve security feedback for developers, we conducted a participatory design study with 25 professional software developers in focus groups. we identify which security information is considered helpful in avoiding insecure cryptographic api use during development. concerning console messages, participants suggested five core elements, namely message classification, title message, code location, link to detailed external resources, and color. design guidelines for end-user warnings are only partially suitable in this context. participants emphasized the importance of tailoring the detail and content of security information to the context. console warnings call for concise communication; further information needs to be linked externally. therefore, security feedback should transcend tools and should be adjustable by software developers across development tools, considering the work context and developer needs. insecure capi use is a critical issue for software security with far-reaching consequences for users [31, 1]. our work contributes to a potential mitigation of the problem. while previous work showed that api redesign [1], improved documentation [2] and better tool support [33] are promising directions, we follow another line of research and improve a proposal for capi based console security feedback [17]. our participatory design approach helped to identify areas of improvement for existing approaches. the fg sessions uncovered specific design aspects for capi warnings compared to other warnings in the developer console. most of our participants would implement such a security warning for capis. they designed these in the fgs, but went one step further: they discussed how much information they need and prefer in which phase of their development process. our results can support api developers and researchers in further developing usable cws.",739
ReCog: Supporting Blind People in Recognizing Personal Objects,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376143,"we present recog, a mobile app that enables blind users to recognize objects by training a deep network with their own photos of such objects. this functionality is useful to differentiate personal objects, which cannot be recognized with pre-trained recognizers and may lack distinguishing tactile features. to ensure that the objects are well-framed in the captured photos, recog integrates a camera-aiming guidance that tracks target objects and instructs the user through verbal and sonification feedback to appropriately frame them. we report a two-session study with 10 blind participants using recog for object training and recognition, with and without guidance. we show that recog enables blind users to train and recognize their personal objects, and that camera-aiming guidance helps novice users to increase their confidence, achieve better accuracy, and learn strategies to capture better photos. we designed and developed recog, an interactive smartphone application that enables blind people to recognize their personal objects. this is achieved by capturing photos of such objects and training a recognition model with them. this approach complements general object recognizers, which can recognize common objects only, and crowdsourcing approaches, which rely on human intervention for detailed object recognition. since capturing well-framed photos is a known diffculty for blind people, we augmented our system with a camera-aiming guidance module that supports the users while capturing photos. we evaluated the system with 10 blind participants who found it to be usable and accurate. during session 1, we uncovered a subjective preference for camera-aiming guidance. the analysis of the captured photos confrmed that the use of the guidance modality results in more consistent photo capturing. in particular, the captured objects are better centered and scaled with respect to the photo frame. during session 2, the participants gradually started to prefer to use the system without camera-aiming guidance as they improved and acquired confdence in their photo taking skills through prolonged usage of the system. however they still felt more confdent using the system with camera-aiming guidance for the training of the object recognizer to ensure a higher recognition accuracy. we also discovered specifc limitations due to the nature of the object recognition technology. while single photos are suffcient at testing time, multiple photos of an object need to be captured during the training, which users may fnd cumbersome. the system relies on the labeling of the trained objects, which may require sighted assistance or the using an external system. as a future work, we will integrate recog with general object recognizers and crowdsourcing approaches in order to minimize the user’s need for intervention.",740
Breaking The Experience: Effects of Questionnaires in VR User Studies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376144,"questionnaires are among the most common research tools in virtual reality (vr) evaluations and user studies. however, transitioning from virtual worlds to the physical world to respond to vr experience questionnaires can potentially lead to systematic biases. administering questionnaires in vr (invrqs) is becoming more common in contemporary research. this is based on the intuitive notion that invrqs may ease participation, reduce the break in presence (bip) and avoid biases. in this paper, we perform a systematic investigation into the effects of interrupting the vr experience through questionnaires using physiological data as a continuous and objective measure of presence. in a user study (n=50), we evaluated question-asking procedures using a vr shooter with two different levels of immersion. the users rated their player experience with a questionnaire either inside or outside of vr. our results indicate a reduced bip for the employed invrq without affecting the self-reported player experience. questionnaires are widespread measurement instruments to assess subjective responses on a particular experience in vr user studies. however, research on presence shows evidence that switching between vr and physical reality leads to a break in presence [48, 89] that might alter the outcomes of the self-reports [74], especially when assessing constructs that are sensitive to disturbance and should be assessed with the least possible invasion. researchers started to administer questionnaires in vr, which most likely reduce the bip [29]. yet, related work offered no clear evidence whether invrqs diminish the bip and to what extent filling out questionnaires contributes to a bip. in this paper, we investigated how question-asking itself breaks the vr experience (h1) and if invrqs can minimize the break in presence (h2) and therefore, reduce uncontrolled biases in performance (h3) and self-reports (h4). to investigate our hypotheses, we conducted a user study (n=50) where we recorded biosignals of subjects while they played a simple vr shooter either with low or high visual fidelity and filled out questionnaires regarding their px both in vr and on pc in physical reality. our results clearly show that both questionnaire modalities produce bips. moreover, the physiological responses in the eda for invrqs are significantly lower and shorter than to outvrqs. these results show evidence that invrqs are less invasive than outvrqs and provide more reliable self-reports. our findings suggest an influence of bips on performance of subsequent tasks. moreover, these effects might become even more prominent in ves high-quality vr experiences, such as aaa games as there is “more immersion to break”. our findings can help researchers and designers to apply the appropriate instruments for their study design and lay groundwork for the design of invrqs to provide validated and standardized methods of question-asking in vr.",741
"""Hey Model!"" – Natural User Interactions and Agency in Accessible Interactive 3D Models",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376145,"while developments in 3d printing have opened up opportunities for improved access to graphical information for people who are blind or have low vision (blv), they can provide only limited detailed and contextual information. interactive 3d printed models (i3ms) that provide audio labels and/or a conversational agent interface potentially overcome this limitation. we conducted a wizard-of-oz exploratory study to uncover the multi-modal interaction techniques that blv people would like to use when exploring i3ms, and investigated their attitudes towards different levels of model agency. these findings informed the creation of an i3m prototype of the solar system. a second user study with this model revealed a hierarchy of interaction, with blv users preferring tactile exploration, followed by touch gestures to trigger audio labels, and then natural language to fill in knowledge gaps and confirm understanding. in this paper we have presented two user studies investigating blind and low vision (blv) peoples’ preferred interaction techniques and modalities for interactive 3d printed models (i3ms). study 1 utilised a wizard-of-oz methodology, and study 2 confirmed the results by evaluating the use of a prototype i3m of the solar system the design of which was informed by the findings of study 1. we found that participants wished to use a mix of tactile exploration, touch triggered passive audio labels, and natural language questioning to obtain information from the model with a mix of audio and haptic output. they enjoyed engaging with models that had multiple parts, and would remove parts to further explore and compare them. when talking to the model, participants treated it as a conversational agent and indicated that they preferred more intelligent models that support natural language and which, when appropriate, could provide guidance to the user. participants wished to be as independent as possible and establish their own interpretations. they wanted to initiate interactions with the model and generally preferred lower model agency. however, they did want the model to intervene if they did something wrong such as placing a component in the wrong place. the desire for independent exploration led to a hierarchy of interaction modalities: most participants preferred to glean information and answer questions using tactile exploration, then to use touch triggered audio labels for specific details, finally using natural language questions to obtain information not in the label or to confirm their understanding. however, interaction choices were driven by participants’ prior tactile and technological experiences. not only are these findings of significance to the assistive technology community, they also have wider implications to hci. in particular the combination of i3ms with conversational agents suggests a radically new kind of embodied conversational agent, one that is physically embodied and that can be perceived tactually by a blv person, rather than the traditional embodied conversational agent that is perceived visually and has a human-like experience [14]. such physically embodied conversational agents raise many interesting research questions, including their perceived agency, autonomy and acceptance by the end user. there are also many questions to be answered on how such agents can be implemented. a major focus of our future research will be to design and construct a fully functional prototype, conduct more extensive user evaluations with a variety of models, including maps, and to explore whether model agency preferences differ with age and environment.",742
Meta-AR-App: An Authoring Platform for Collaborative Augmented Reality in STEM Classrooms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376146,"augmented reality (ar) has become a valuable tool for education and training processes. meanwhile, cloud-based technologies can foster collaboration and other interaction modalities to enhance learning. we combine the cloud capabilities with ar technologies to present meta-ar-app, an authoring platform for collaborative ar, which enables authoring between instructors and students. additionally, we introduce a new application of an established collaboration process, the pull-based development model, to enable sharing and retrieving of ar learning content. we customize this model and create two modalities of interaction for the classroom: local (student to student) and global (instructor to class) pull. based on observations from our user studies, we organize a four-category classroom model which implements our system: work, design, collaboration, and technology. further, our system enables an iterative improvement workflow of the class content and enables synergistic collaboration that empowers students to be active agents in the learning process. we presented meta-ar-app, an authoring platform for collaborative ar. we demonstrated how we can leverage the medium of ar combined with cloud technologies to support selective (i.e., high quality) and timely collaboration, which enables a decrease in error during problem-solving. apart from these novel interaction modalities, we observed how iterative improvement of the ar learning content (global pull) based on previous contributions made by students (local pull) can improve the original ar project and spark curiosity and creativity among students’ learning process. the next step will be to explore scaling the system to support a community of contributors with reusable templates of project-based ar learning content. the unique aspect of our technology for stem learning is that it encourages discoveries of complex concepts through a trial-and-error exploration and facilitates effective debugging individually and collectively.",743
PenSight: Enhanced Interaction with a Pen-Top Camera,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376147,"we propose mounting a downward-facing camera above the top end of a digital tablet pen. this creates a unique and practical viewing angle for capturing the pen-holding hand and the immediate surroundings which can include the other hand. the fabrication of a prototype device is described and the enabled interaction design space is explored, including dominant and non-dominant hand pose recognition, tablet grip detection, hand gestures, capturing physical content in the environment, and detecting users and pens. a deep learning computer vision pipeline is developed for classification, regression, and keypoint detection to enable these interactions. example applications demonstrate usage scenarios and a qualitative user evaluation confirms the potential of the approach. we presented pensight, a concept to enhance pen interaction for tablets by attaching a camera to the top of the pen. we built prototypes using a fisheye camera and 3d-printed mounts to explore several examples of techniques enabled by this paradigm. these include posture-based interaction using both hands, individually or in tandem, interacting with physical documents in the surrounding environment and identifying users and the attached pen. we examined postures and off-tablet interaction in more depth with two demonstration applications. the results of our qualitative evaluation demonstrate potential for postures formed by the other hand when not holding the tablet and for some poses of the pen-holding hand. there are doubtless many other possible techniques that can be realised. overall, we believe pensight provides a simple holistic mobile sensing solution for capturing and interpreting interactions of the two hands as well as the surrounding environment.",744
From Data to Insights: A Layered Storytelling Approach for Multimodal Learning Analytics,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376148,"significant progress to integrate and analyse multimodal data has been carried out in the last years. yet, little research has tackled the challenge of visualising and supporting the sensemaking of multimodal data to inform teaching and learning. it is naïve to expect that simply by rendering multiple data streams visually, a teacher or learner will be able to make sense of them. this paper introduces an approach to unravel the complexity of multimodal data by organising it into meaningful layers that explain critical insights to teachers and students. the approach is illustrated through the design of two data storytelling prototypes in the context of nursing simulation. two authentic studies with educators and students identified the potential of the approach to create learning analytics interfaces that communicate insights on team performance, as well as concerns in terms of accountability and automated insights discovery. as humans struggle with the data tsunami, we are now awash with dashboard prototypes and products. yet, there is growing evidence that these are far from intuitive. this paper documents how we have wrestled with the challenge of designing activity-based feedback visualisations which draw the attention of non-technical users to key insights in the data. we argue, supported by user studies, that this work advances the state of the art in making multimodal data streams intelligible to non-data experts. the approach should enable similar collocated activities to benefit from these novel collaboration analytics.",745
Computing Students' Learning Difficulties in HCI Education,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376149,"software developers often make interface design decisions and work with designers. therefore, computing students who seek to become developers need some education about interface design. while prior work has studied difficulties that educators face when teaching design to computing students, there is comparatively little work on the difficulties computing students face when learning hci design skills. to uncover these difficulties, we conducted two qualitative studies consisting of surveys and interviews with (1) computing students and (2) educators who teach interface design to computing students. qualitative analysis of their responses revealed 18 types of learning difficulties students might experience in hci design education, including difficulties around the mechanics of design work, project management skills, the wicked nature of design problems, and distorted perspectives on design. nonetheless, our findings reveal a number of interesting implications for research. for instance, how prevalent are these difficulties in broader contexts? under what conditions (e.g., studio-based vs. traditional lecture-based classes) might computing students experience these kinds of difficulties more or less often? as hci expands beyond higher education into primary and secondary curricula (like exploring computer science [24] or code.org [1]), will these learning difficulties still hold? and what are effective strategies to mitigate students’ learning difficulties that fit these categories? the rush difficulty revealed by educators in study 2 also suggests an interesting hypothesis: the way we teach computing students to create software and write code may make them less likely to succeed at interface design work. future work in this area should explore the extent to which prior computing knowledge influences students’ experiences with these difficulties. our results also contribute to the discourse around pedagogical content knowledge (pck) [63] development for hci design education. pck is domain-specific [29, 35, 37] and consists of knowledge of pedagogical strategies to teach a particular topic, in a particular context, to a particular audience. exact definitions of the components of pck vary (c.f. [8, 19, 50]), but knowledge of student learning difficulties is generally considered a core aspect. our field has only begun to investigate the nature of computing pck within the past decade, from primary and secondary learning environments [6, 21, 49, 59, 67], to both general [34, 35] and specific [39, 40, 44, 47, 52, 53, 69] aspects of post-secondary cs education. a prior study of ours did explore pck for teaching software interface design skills [53], but it was scoped specifically to teaching a particular gender-inclusive interface design method and focused on educators’ pedagogical strategies rather than students’ perspectives. therefore, the set of student learning difficulties described in this paper provides some of the first foundations for future research on pck for general hci design education. further exploring this space might enable more effective use of instruction time in hci classes (which are known to suffer from time constraints already [15]) through the development of more effective learning materials, or even help shorten the onboarding time for new hci design educators—an important pursuit to ensure we have enough teachers to keep pace with the rapid growth of computing education. equipped with this better understanding of student learning difficulties, we can begin to deepen our understanding of how to provide computing students with effective design educations. implementing this newly gained knowledge in curricula and pedagogy will lead to better teaching and learning around hci design concepts. through this effort, the software industry as a whole will benefit from a pool of design-literate computing graduates who enter the workforce ready to understand and contribute to many aspects of large projects, aware of the impacts of their design choices. developers will be empowered to design usable, accessible, ethical, and inclusive software interfaces, allowing more diverse populations to engage with various technologies and participate in today’s computing-infused world.",746
Evaluating 'Prefer not to say' Around Sensitive Disclosures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376150,"as people's offline and online lives become increasingly entwined, the sensitivity of personal information disclosed online is increasing. disclosures often occur through structured disclosure fields (e.g., drop-down lists). prior research suggests these fields may limit privacy, with non-disclosing users being presumed to be hiding undesirable information. we investigated this around hiv status disclosure in online dating apps used by men who have sex with men. our online study asked participants (n=183) to rate profiles where hiv status was either disclosed or undisclosed. we tested three designs for displaying undisclosed fields. visibility of undisclosed fields had a significant effect on the way profiles were rated, and other profile information (e.g., ethnicity) could affect inferences that develop around undisclosed information. our research highlights complexities around designing for non-disclosure and questions the voluntary nature of these fields. further work is outlined to ensure disclosure control is appropriately implemented around online sensitive information disclosures. whilst prior research found structured disclosure fields restricting forms of individual expression for marginalised groups [31], our findings suggest that these same disclosure fields can limit disclosure choice, and similarly disadvantage marginalised users. whilst this work shows how design can be used to reduce the effect of privacy unraveling leading to an increase in disclosure control, this may not be effective for marginalised groups. this study shines a spotlight on a simple, yet commonly used form field, and raises further questions that need to be explored within this area of social research. this is needed to ensure disclosure control is appropriately implemented into these fields and to better understand how indirect disclosure may occur through their use.",747
Proximate Social Factors in First-Time Contribution to Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376151,"in the course of every member's integration into an online community, a decision must be made to participate for the first time. the challenges of effective recruitment, management, and retention of new users have been extensively explored in social computing research. however, little work has looked at in-the-moment factors that lead users to decide to participate instead of ""lurk"", conditions which can be shaped to draw new users in at crucial moments. in this work we analyze 183 million messages scraped from chatrooms on the livestreaming platform twitch in order to understand differences between first-time participants' and regulars' behaviors and to identify conditions that encourage first-time participation. we find that presence of diverse types of users increases likelihood of new participation, with effects depending on the size of the community. we also find that information-seeking behaviors in first-time participation are negatively associated with retention in the short and medium term.",748
Data-driven Multi-level Segmentation of Image Editing Logs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376152,"automatic segmentation of logs for creativity tools such as image editing systems could improve their usability and learnability by supporting such interaction use cases as smart history navigation or recommending alternative design choices. we propose a multi-level segmentation model that works for many image editing tasks including poster creation, portrait retouching, and special effect creation. the lowest-level chunks of logged events are computed using a support vector machine model and higher-level chunks are built on top of these, at a level of granularity that can be customized for specific use cases. our model takes into account features derived from four event attributes collected in realistically complex photoshop sessions with expert users: command, timestamp, image content, and artwork layer. we present a detailed analysis of the relevance of each feature and evaluate the model using both quantitative performance metrics and qualitative analysis of sample sessions. we developed a multi-level segmentation model for real-world image editing logs that works for three image editing tasks. we present evidence for what features are relevant and irrelevant for the segmentation. results show that command and layer similarity are highly relevant, image-related features are not useful despite claims in previous work, and duration is debatable due to the limitation in data collection. we also present quantitative and qualitative evaluation of our segmentation model, and show that it performs reasonably well for the challenging problem of segmenting realistic logs that capture mistakes, experiments, and subtask switching.",749
Data Everyday: Data Literacy Practices in a Division I College Sports Context,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376153,"data analysis is central to sports training. today, cutting-edge digital technologies are deployed to measure and improve athletes' performance. but too often researchers focus on the technology collecting performance data at the expense of understanding athletes' experiences with data. this is particularly the case in the understudied context of collegiate athletics, where competition is fierce, tools for data analysis abound, and the institution actively manages athletes' lives. by investigating how student-athletes analyze their performance data and are analyzed in turn, we can better understand the individual and institutional factors that make data literacy practices in athletics meaningful and productive-or not. our pilot interview study of student-athletes at one division i university reveals a set of opportunities for student-athletes to engage with and learn from data analytics practices. these opportunities come with a set of contextual tensions that should inform the design of new technologies for collegiate sports settings. our findings have three major implications for research on hci and sports. first, personal informatics practices in sports settings could have an impact beyond the sport itself to include data literacy practices more broadly. frameworks for data literacy can help us identify these practices and push them forward. second, our findings suggest that the level of competition in division i sports creates social and emotional dynamics that differentiate athletes’ experiences with data even from elite athletes in other contexts. finally, our findings indicate that hci and sports researchers need more study and consideration of the influence of organizational contexts on data practices. further work is needed to more deeply explore the impacts of organizational infrastructure within specific sports, across multiple institutions, and beyond collegiate contexts. additionally, more ethnographic approaches are needed to further explain how organizational infrastructures impact data literacy practices on a moment-to-moment basis. this pilot work guides our next steps geared toward understanding such nuances to develop learning tools and experiences for data literacy in sports play. beyond hci and sports, student-athletes’ experiences of data monitoring, particularly of health data (or even their academic data [63]), are similar to other workers’ experiences of, e.g., biometrics. however, division 1 athletics’ high investment in athletes means they are likely the leading edge of trends that will filter out to the broader population as technologies cheapen and such managerial practices become more socially acceptable.",750
TalkingBoogie: Collaborative Mobile AAC System for Non-verbal Children with Developmental Disabilities and Their Caregivers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376154,"augmentative and alternative communication (aac) technologies are widely used to help non-verbal children enable communication. for aac-aided communication to be successful, caregivers should support children with consistent intervention strategies in various settings. as such, caregivers need to continuously observe and discuss children's aac usage to create a shared understanding of these strategies. however, caregivers often find it challenging to effectively collaborate with one another due to a lack of family involvement and the unstructured process of collaboration. to address these issues, we present talkingboogie, which consists of two mobile apps: talkingboogie-aac for caregiver-child communication, and talkingboogie-coach supporting caregiver collaboration. working together, these applications provide contextualized layouts for symbol arrangement, scaffold the process of sharing and discussing observations, and induce caregivers' balanced participation. a two-week deployment study with four groups (n=11) found that talkingboogie helped increase mutual understanding of strategies and encourage balanced participation between caregivers with reduced cognitive loads. in this paper, we designed and evaluated talkingboogie, a collaborative aac system that supports multiple caregivers to actively participate in the aac-aided communication of a child. with two mobile applications, talkingboogie balances the participation of caregivers in collaboration and scaffolds the overall process of sharing and discussing observations on children. through a two-week field evaluation, we could identify the feasibility of a collaborative aac system.",751
texSketch: Active Diagramming through Pen-and-Ink Annotations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376155,"learning from text is a constructive activity in which sentence-level information is combined by the reader to build coherent mental models. with increasingly complex texts, forming a mental model becomes challenging due to a lack of background knowledge, and limits in working memory and attention. to address this, we are taught knowledge externalization strategies such as active reading and diagramming. unfortunately, paper-and-pencil approaches may not always be appropriate, and software solutions create friction through difficult input modalities, limited workflow support, and barriers between reading and diagramming. for all but the simplest text, building coherent diagrams can be tedious and difficult. we propose active diagramming, an approach extending familiar active reading strategies to the task of diagram construction. our prototype, texsketch, combines pen-and-ink interactions with natural language processing to reduce the cost of producing diagrams while maintaining the cognitive effort necessary for comprehension. our user study finds that readers can effectively create diagrams without disrupting reading. based on models for science text comprehension, we present an end-to-end workflow for knowledge externalization called active diagramming. through a probe study, we identified key features needed to support active diagramming. the result is texsketch, a pen-and-ink system for building diagrams during reading. with texsketch, we focus on helping the reader convert annotations they make in text into integrated mental models. the iterative process of select-organize-integrate lets readers take text-level annotations into connected propositions and then combine them. nlp-based features on key terms help focus the reader’s attention. our interactions implement a consistent gesture language and allow readers flexibility in switching between text and diagram representations as they read. our approach demonstrates a balance between providing readers with opportunities to learn through active diagramming while reducing non-desirable and distracting difficulties.",752
"""Out of Luck"": Socio-Economic Differences in Student Coping Responses to Technology Problems",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376156,"despite high levels of digital technology access among college students, technology disruption remains an issue. this study was conducted to understand how technology disruption might contribute to socio-economic disparities in academic performance. data were analyzed from a non-representative sample of 748 undergraduate students. we examined socio-economic differences in types of technology problems students experience; the consequences of those problems; and beliefs about how to handle future problems. socio-economic status was not associated with types of technology problems, but it was associated with greater negative consequences and less-efficacious beliefs about handling future situations. these findings are consistent with sociological work on socio-economic differences in student help-seeking. they also elaborate mechanistic understanding of the technology maintenance construct. finally, for those interested in designing to reduce socio-economic inequalities, they suggest the need for interfaces that go beyond information accessibility to facilitate student empowerment and student-teacher communication. technology has radically transformed how we learn and communicate in educational settings. the hci community has invested a great time and resources trying to exploit these new tools to improve the learning experience, including tools for those from disadvantaged backgrounds. we hope these findings elaborate on the complexity of these issues, and offer additional nuance for understanding why design, and technology in general, is limited in what it is able to do to reduce educational inequalities [47]. one way to do this is to broaden awareness of the scope of factors that limit success for low-income students beyond a difference in skills and access to material resources. as our findings illustrate, it is the socio-emotional resources that may often be most consequential in shaping low-ses students’ successes. appreciating these factors, and designing to support these differences, may be one way to help optimize the success of new digital tools in educational contexts.",753
Exploring Auditory Information to Change Users' Perception of Time Passing as Shorter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376157,"although the processing speed of computers has been drastically increasing year by year, users still have to wait for computers to complete tasks or to respond. to cope with this, several studies have proposed presenting certain visual information to users to change their perception of time passing as shorter, e.g., progress bars with animated ribbing or faster/slower virtual clocks. as speech interfaces such as smart speakers are becoming popular, a novel method is required to make users perceive the passing of time as shorter by presenting auditory stimuli. we thus prepared 20 pieces of auditory information as experimental stimuli; that is, 11 auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration but different numbers of 0.1-second sine-wave sounds and 9 other auditory stimuli that have the same 10.1-second duration and numbers of sounds but different interval patterns between the sounds. we conducted three experiments to figure out which kinds of auditory stimuli can change users' perception of time passing as shorter. we found that a 10.1-second auditory stimulus that has 0.1-second sine-wave sounds appearing 11 times with intervals between the sounds that narrow rapidly in a linear fashion was perceived as shortest at about 9.3 seconds, which was 7.6% shorter than the actual duration of the stimulus. we also found that different interval patterns of sounds in auditory information significantly affected users' perception of time passing as shorter, while different numbers of sounds did not. in this paper, we explored which kinds of auditory stimuli can change how users perceive the passing of time on the basis of knowledge on filled-duration illusions, especially which auditory stimuli were perceived by the users as “i feel this sound is shorter.” specifically, we conducted three experiments. in experiment 1, auditory stimuli that have the same duration but different numbers of elements were presented to the participants in a paired comparison manner. as a result, the participants felt that the stimuli with more elements had a shorter duration, while those with fewer elements had a longer one. in experiment 2, stimuli that had the same duration and numbers of stimuli but had different interval patterns between elements were also presented in a paired comparison manner. as a result, the participants felt that stimuli that got narrower had a shorter duration and those that got wider had a longer one. in experiment 3, we selected two stimuli from both experiments (one was perceived as having the shortest duration and the other as having the longest duration in each experiment), and these stimuli were presented independently. as a result, stimulus nlr, which was perceived as being the shortest in experiment 2, was perceived as being about 9.3 seconds, which was 7.6% shorter than the actual duration of the stimulus, and this estimated duration was significantly shorter than those of the other stimuli. we thus succeeded in finding an auditory stimulus that makes users feel that a duration of time is shorter than it actually is and in figuring out that the interval patterns of elements significantly affected the users’ perception of time passing as shorter, while the numbers of sounds did not. we are sure that this auditory stimulus can thus improve the user experience, especially when users have to wait for computers to complete tasks or to respond. before implementing the results of this study in actual applications, we have to immediately conduct several subsequent experiments to clarify which kinds of parameters should be prepared for the auditory stimuli that get narrower, e.g., the numbers of elements, the durations of the stimuli, and transition patterns of intervals. exploring such possible patterns of auditory stimuli will clarify the significant factors that effectively change how users perceive the passing of time.",754
Place-Based Policymaking and HCI: Opportunities and Challenges for Technology Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376158,"there has been a growing interest in hci in designing and developing technology to support democratic participation, particularly in the domain of urban planning or place-based research. in addition, the hci field has increasingly considered the intersection of hci and policymaking to understand how our research can have a broader impact. in this paper, we report on a series of workshops with citizens and city planners to explore place-based policymaking through the case study of neighbourhood planning in the uk. our analysis highlights the tensions, opportunities and challenges faced by citizens in creating policy. drawing from our findings, we stress the need for hci to be actively involved in supporting, innovating and (re)designing civic policymaking processes while emphasising design considerations for the development of technological tools. we have shown how place-based policymaking processes are complex and difficult to access for citizens, with a myriad of problems communicating with experts, engaging citizens and writing policy. we have made a number of recommendations for hci researchers to become actively involved in supporting, innovating and (re)designing policy processes, and to design tools embedded within policy enabling citizen voices to carry through to decision-making in a real way. ultimately, we encourage the field of hci to consider policy within their research so that rather than designing digital tools in isolation, we can begin to make a stronger impact in public policy. place-based policy is only one context within which hci researchers work, and we believe our findings could have broader implications for other policy domains, although we recognise further research is needed to validate this.",755
Designing Clinical AAC Tablet Applications with Adults who have Mild Intellectual Disabilities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376159,"patients with mild intellectual disabilities (id) face significant communication barriers within primary care services. this has a detrimental effect on the quality of treatment being provided, meaning the consultation process could benefit from augmentative and alternative communication (aac) technologies. however, little research has been conducted in this area beyond that of paper-based aids. we address this by extracting design requirements for a clinical aac tablet application from n=10 adults with mild id. our results show that such technologies can promote communication between general practitioners (gps) and patients with mild id by extracting symptoms in advance of the consultation via an accessible questionnaire. these symptoms act as a referent and assist in raising the awareness of conditions commonly overlooked by gps. furthermore, the application can support people with id in identifying and accessing healthcare services. finally, the participants identified 6 key factors that affect the clarity of medical images. aac technologies have the potential to assist people with mild id throughout all aspects of life, yet our findings show their use remains limited within the clinical context. just one of the ten participants regularly utilized an aid (patient passport) during consultations, despite the call for the embedment of high-tech aac devices being made as far back as 1997 [43]. one reason for this may be the lack of guidelines to assist developers in creating such technologies. the authors could only identify those disseminated by gibson et al. [14–16] yet their studies suffered from a lack of end-user involvement. consequently, we extracted design requirements for a clinical aac application from ten people with mild id. the participants believe that the aid can assist in mitigating barriers across the entire consultation process, beginning with reserving and accessing appointments. the primary method of promoting communication aligned with the views of the experts in [14–16], by supplying gps with symptoms selected from an accessible questionnaire. this questionnaire should adapt to both the user’s accessibility and medical needs and utilize evidence on the health trends experienced by people with id. as such, commonly overlooked conditions may also be brought to the attention of the gp and potential time constraints may be alleviated.",756
Pronto: Rapid Augmented Reality Video Prototyping Using Sketches and Enaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376160,"designers have limited tools to prototype ar experiences rapidly. can lightweight, immediate tools let designers prototype dynamic ar interactions while capturing the nuances of a 3d experience? we interviewed three ar experts and identified several recurring issues in ar design: creating and positioning 3d assets, handling the changing user position, and orchestrating multiple animations. we introduce project pronto, a tablet-based video prototyping system that combines 2d video with 3d manipulation. pronto supports four intertwined activities: capturing 3d spatial information alongside a video scenario, positioning and sketching 2d drawings in a 3d world, and enacting animations with physical interactions. an observational study with professional designers shows that participants can use pronto to prototype diverse ar experiences. all participants performed two tasks: replicating a sample non-trivial ar experience and prototyping their open-ended designs. all participants completed the replication task and found pronto easy to use. most participants found that pronto encourages more exploration of designs than their current practices. we presented pronto, a rapid prototyping tool for ar experiences that uses augmented video, sketching, and enaction using a tablet. we interviewed three ar expert designers and formulated a set of design goals to address the current limitations of ar prototyping tools. based on these goals, we have demonstrated an end-to-end workflow and interaction technique to create and modify ar objects on an augmented recorded video. our work expands the body of hci research in prototyping tools for ar by combining sketching, enaction, and augmented video. finally, we evaluated the system with expert ar designers, showing the potential of the workflow for rapid prototyping in contrast to current practices. our work suggests several interesting directions for future research. we would like to explore enhanced capturing capabilities to facilitate the creation of interaction during playback. to this end, we would like to employ state-of-the-art computer vision and sensing capabilities to capture user actions—hand gestures, gaze, and skeleton tracking—and environment information, such as a 3d depth map. this would significantly enhance the drawing and animation workflow for better spatiotemporal anchoring. for instance, the designer can sketch an object and attach it to the user’s hand in the recorded video. we would also like to enhance the capture with audio to prototype voice interaction. timing animations and coordinating them with the changing user viewpoint is a weakness of our current system. we would like to investigate enhancing this while still maintaining the simplicity of a single timeline. we would also like to explore incorporating multiple video captures to accommodate changing environments or multiple viewpoints. although our current workflow requires the designer to be in the same space for capturing and prototyping, in the future, we would like to explore remote capturing, working with scales spanning from the miniature to the massive, e.g., underwater or a drone-captured urban space. this would broaden the scope and capabilities of pronto beyond prototyping, to the design and analysis in engineering and architecture. we would also like to enhance the expressive qualities of animations by drawing insights from the rich literature of performance and sketch-based animation tools in hci and graphics [25, 54]. beyond animations, supporting annotations, commenting, reviewing, recapturing the video without losing the sketches, and collaboration would significantly enhance the capabilities of pronto. validating these ideas is an exciting future work direction that would further expand the scope of contextual prototyping and ideation.",757

"Social Acceptability in HCI: A Survey of Methods, Measures, and Design Strategies",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376162,"with the increasing ubiquity of personal devices, social acceptability of human-machine interactions has gained relevance and growing interest from the hci community. yet, there are no best practices or established methods for evaluating social acceptability. design strategies for increasing social acceptability have been described and employed, but so far not been holistically appraised and evaluated. we offer a systematic literature analysis (n=69) of social acceptability in hci and contribute a better understanding of current research practices, namely, methods employed, measures and design strategies. our review identified an unbalanced distribution of study approaches, shortcomings in employed measures, and a lack of interweaving between empirical and artifact-creating approaches. the latter causes a discrepancy between design recommendations based on user research, and design strategies employed in artifact creation. our survey lays the groundwork for a more nuanced evaluation of social acceptability, the development of best practices, and a future research agenda. in this work, we reviewed papers on social acceptability in hci. during the nearly 20 years covered by our analysis, a significant amount of contributions to a better understanding of social acceptability (and impression management) in hci were made. however, we also identified gaps in the distribution of research approaches. in particular, ethnography, participatory design and field research in naturalistic settings without the researcher’s presence were only sparsely employed. moreover, we showed that the consideration of social acceptability is not yet interwoven with the whole design process: results from empirical work on social acceptability do not propagate to the creation of socially acceptable designs or prototypes. last but not least, we discussed the current lack of established, standardized questionnaires quantifying social acceptability in a non-proxied fashion, and highlight the need to develop differentiated and truly operational measures. we hope to inspire more discussions about what constitutes social acceptability in hci [57, 58], what constructs it might comprise (e.g., “coolness” [18, 97]), and how design activities can be proactively oriented toward influencing social acceptability.",759
Does Smartphone Use Drive our Emotions or vice versa? A Causal Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376163,"in this paper, we demonstrate the existence of a bidirectional causal relationship between smartphone application use and user emotions. in a two-week long in-the-wild study with 30 participants we captured 502,851 instances of smartphone application use in tandem with corresponding emotional data from facial expressions. our analysis shows that while in most cases application use drives user emotions, multiple application categories exist for which the causal effect is in the opposite direction. our findings shed light on the relationship between smartphone use and emotional states. we furthermore discuss the opportunities for research and practice that arise from our findings and their potential to support emotional well-being. in this work, we investigate the bidirectional causal relationship between the emotional state of users and their phone use. our results show that for some participants, the use of particular apps causes them to experience certain emotions; however, for other participants, their emotions drive app use behaviour. we also found noticeable differences between different application categories with regards to their causal relationship with the users’ emotional state. these quantitative findings corresponded with qualitative results showing that participants mentioned that certain applications cause them to experience certain emotions, and that feeling certain emotions led them to use certain applications. our findings are a step towards building personalised models which can help users better understand the relationship between their phone use is intertwined with their emotional states. this could potentially lead to more effective decision-making with regards to smartphone use as well as better technology-mediated support for emotion regulation.",760
EAST: Early Autism Screening Tool for Preschoolers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376164,"we describe the iterative co-design process and evaluation of an early autism screening tool (east). east is an intermediary interactive tablet based app that assists in the early-detection of autism spectrum disorder (asd) by screening preschoolers in pakistan through play-based activities in a home, school or clinical setting. medical professionals, parents of autistic children and teachers were surveyed through focus groups to understand the reasons that contribute to the increasing number of missed early detections, and late- or misdiagnoses. we also evaluate the acceptability, usability and validity of our tool. we tested east with both typically developed and autistic children on how they relate to people, imitation, motor skills, visual and intellectual response. they were scored via time taken, the number of wrong attempts, or incorrect answers and audiovisual feedback. this paper contributes towards a digital autism screening tool that delivers insights into the child's behaviour and enables collaboration among parents, teachers and medical professionals. in conclusion, we have built a better understanding of the problem and improved the acceptance and validity of a digital tool. we co-designed a usable, efficient, engaging, and interactive platform that will assist in early detection of asd through screening preschoolers in a home, school or clinical environment and ensured collaboration among stakeholders. the next phase will see us getting our tool validated through a clinical trial by involving general practitioners who are the first point of contact. our tool can correspondingly act as a measure of yearly progress of the child in specific areas by keeping track of the child’s performance. we plan to conduct a cross-cultural study (in the middle east) to establish validation of east universally. furthermore, it can also be mapped onto screening other developmental disorders and learning disabilities.",761
Why Johnny Can't Unsubscribe: Barriers to Stopping Unwanted Email,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376165,"a large proportion of email messages in an average internet user's inbox are unwanted commercial messages from mailing lists, bots, and so on. although such messages often include instructions to unsubscribe, people still struggle with stopping unwanted email. we investigated the user experience of unsubscribing from unwanted email messages by recruiting 18 individuals for via a lab study followed by semi-structured interviews. based on unsubscribing practices of the study participants, we synthesized eight common unsubscription mechanisms and identified the corresponding user experience challenges. we further uncovered alternative practices aimed at circumventing the need to unsubscribe. our findings reveal frustration with the prevailing options for limiting access to the self by managing email boundaries. we apply our insight to offer design suggestions that could help commercial providers improve the user experience of unsubscribing and provide users more control over the email they receive. users struggle to manage unwanted email, leaving them with a sense of decreasing control over their inboxes. even though participants in our study were relatively familiar with the process of unsubscribing, user experience issues prevented effective use of available mechanisms to establish and assert effective email boundaries. the barriers to unsubscribing uncovered in our study underscore the need for increased attention by commercial entities and email providers to making unsubscribing truly functional for end users.",762
Making Chat at Home in the Hospital: Exploring Chat Use by Nurses,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376166,"in this paper, we examine whatsapp use by nurses in india. globally, personal chat apps have taken the workplace by storm, and healthcare is no exception. in the hospital setting, this raises questions around how chat apps are integrated into hospital work and the consequences of using such personal tools for work. to address these questions, we conducted an ethnographic study of chat use in nurses' work in a large multi-specialty hospital. by examining how chat is embedded in the hospital, rather than focusing on individual use of personal tools, we throw new light on the adoption of personal tools at work — specifically what happens when such tools are adopted and used as though they were organisational tools. in doing so, we explicate their impact on invisible work [77] and the creep of work into personal time, as well as how hierarchy and power play out in technology use. thus, we point to the importance of looking beyond individual adoption by knowledge workers when studying the impact of personal tools at work. in describing the use of chat in nurses’ work, we drew attention to a number of ways chat is made at home in the hospital. a notable difference between our research and most previous research into chat ( [7,35,59] being notable exceptions) is that by taking an ethnographic approach and examining closely how chat is embedded in the ongoing work of the organisation, we explicate how chat is used to accomplish that work and the consequences of its use for workers. we complicated the idea of worker-driven adoption, by showing how whatsapp is used as though it were an organisational tool. by examining how chat bridges the spatial and temporal rhythms of nurses’ work, we highlight the tension between doing nursing and the other work of being a nurse, and how chat brings the hospital home. interestingly, if chat were to be made an organisational tool, this invisible work would be made visible in the organisation. as the use of chat and other personal tools increases in organisations, this has implications beyond knowledge workers and professionals in the global north. we must also understand the impacts on hourly and care workers (such as nurses), whose work is often of a different nature and must be recognized, whether it is physical or digital.",763
The Politics of Privacy Theories: Moving from Norms to Vulnerabilities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376167,"privacy and surveillance are central features of public discourse around use of computing systems. as the systems we design and study are increasingly used and regulated as potential instruments of surveillance, hci researchers-even those whose focus is not privacy-find themselves needing to understand privacy in their work. concepts like contextual integrity and boundary regulation have become touchstones for thinking about privacy in hci. in this paper, we draw on hci and privacy literature to understand the limitations of commonly used theories and examine their assumptions, politics, strengths, and weaknesses. we use a case study from the hci literature to illustrate conceptual gaps in existing frameworks where privacy requirements can fall through. finally, we advocate vulnerability as a core concept for privacy theorizing and examine how feminist, queer-marxist, and intersectional thinking may augment our existing repertoire of privacy theories to create a more inclusive scholarship and design practice. we are witnessing the migration of vulnerable privacy concerns into the mainstream suggesting precisely this point that privileged privacy that serves one end is used to exploit a whole class of individual. for instance, the simple technology used to stalk ipv victims is the very same technology used by parents to track their children [17]. these are technologies that have mainstream legitimate use and thus are slowly becoming the norm. identity and political discourse may be critical to how service providers design for privacy and how users conceive of privacy. this is a departure from individualism as well as normative frames, both of which we have shown to be entangled in ways that reinforce heteronormative, privileged identity discourse and notions of territory. predicting information flows based on expectations is problematic—in large part because companies collect our data and we have no voice in how much and to whom it is given. the privacy violations affecting vulnerable identities are surfacing the problematic nature of our relationship to privacy design and technologies that are unregulated or part of services to the extent that they make attacks possible by people with no technical abilities, or who simply use those technologies and services. the convergence of social, economic, and identitybased disadvantages exacerbates harms by advertisers and governments. facebook algorithms predict, for example, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, based on user liking and friending behavior [52, 56]. loan and job algorithms “learn” to identify women and minorities using otherwise obscure identity proxies like shopping habits or keywords. moreover, our expectations have been constantly put to the test by continuous data breaches and the understanding that we are always sharing our data with technology companies and institutions. individualism assumes that people have equal voice in articulating their privacy and defending it when we know that not to be the case. normative approaches tend to overlook especially the fact that vulnerable individuals do not have a voice in what is agreed upon to be appropriate levels of privacy. intersectional identity frames how people behave in the context of social structures, and how those structures stifle expression and free movement. when looking at norm-based theories, it is important to consider the political theories, cultures, classes, and systems to which they are moored. norm-based theories of privacy draw on collectivism. but what are we to make of norms produced in cultures where the politics (or political goals) are dramatically different? we need to acknowledge that there are competing norms—in some cases to achieve the same ends—and only some norms are articulated in the system. this is because norm-based theories are grounded in shared understanding of only those with legitimate access to these platforms. contexts reflect a world of privilege in design and discourse, and thus require identity- and political-based approaches. intersectional frames bring together identities and structures of power and queer-marxism a “material matrix” and politics of identity; together, we argue, they are best-equipped to deal with this privacy landscape. positionality both authors are privacy researchers with a critical orientation to this space. to adopt and practice intersectionality or critical identity theory, one has to come to terms with their own positionality. as white women scholars who are neither black nor queer, we acknowledge that our role in pointing out where our privacy theories are potentially hegemonic and oppressive, while perhaps helpful, is also problematic. for instance, we take care to credit our ideas to the scholars on whom our work is built, to translate our ideas to concrete suggestions, and to be wary of how our own efforts to contribute may perpetuate the very problems we are seeking to expose and solve: erasure or marginalization, complexity of lived experiences, and the role of norms and power in subjugating vulnerable people.",764
What is this URL's Destination? Empirical Evaluation of Users' URL Reading,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376168,"common anti-phishing advice tells users to mouse over links, look at the url, and compare to the expected destination, implicitly assuming that they are able to read the url. to test this assumption, we conducted a survey with 1929 participants recruited from the amazon mechanical turk and prolific academic platforms. participants were shown 23 urls with various url structures. for each url, participants were asked via a multiple choice question where the url would lead and how safe they feel clicking on it would be. using latent class analysis, participants were stratified by self-reported technology use. participants were strongly biased towards answering that the url would lead to the website of the organization whose name appeared in the url, regardless of its position in the url structure. the group with the highest technology use was only minorly better at url reading. being able to accurately compare a url to an expected destination is an important skill needed in detecting fraudulent urls, such as those sent in phishing communications. our findings clearly illustrate that participants, even those with extensive computer experience, are unable to accurately predict the destinations of relatively simple and trick-free urls. instead of recognising that urls typically go to the organization listed in the domain position, our participants tended to select the recognisable organization name in the url, even if it was located in non-domain positions, such as the subdomain. however, users were not necessarily consistent in their url reading approaches, with only 32.2% consistently selecting the organization name and 8.1% consistently selecting the domain. technology use impacted their ability to correctly read urls, but the impact was fairly low, with mobile users correctly answering only 15.9% of the questions with the organization in the subdomain, and power users only 25.4%. the results are concerning as they indicate that even technically skilled users struggle to accurately predict the destination of a basic url. participants were more likely to rate a url as safe to click on if they thought that its destination was the organisation named in the url. they were also more dubious of short urls than the domain urls, single subdomain urls, and complex urls. this result is somewhat good as it indicates that users can identify that the destinations of short urls are more difficult to predict than the destinations of longer ones.",765
"""Arseing around was Fun!"" – Humor as a Resource in Design and Making",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376169,"humor is an inevitable part of human life. most of us are capable of experiencing and appreciating humor. from this perspective, surprisingly little hci research can be found scrutinizing the existence, role, and potential of humor in our design practice. the gap remains also related to children and teenagers; there is a lack of studies appreciating the emergence and existence of humor in the design process without intentionally evoking it. thus, this study examines humor as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the design process. the study was conducted in collaboration with a class of teenagers and their teachers. the study identifies various forms and functions of humor in the design process and reveals its situated, emergent nature as a resource in interaction within design. the study proposes a practical tool for designers for anticipating and potentially facilitating the emergence, forms and usages of humor as an interactional resource in design. surprisingly little hci research can be found scrutinizing the existence, role and potential of humor in our design practice, approaching humor as a mundane phenomenon in human interaction. this gap also remains in research related to children and teenagers. this study examined humor as naturally occurring in the design process with teens. the study was conducted in collaboration with a local school: with a class of teenagers and their teachers interested in innovation, design and making education. the study identified various forms and functions of humor in the design process and revealed its situated, emergent nature as a resource in interaction. the study identified interesting implications for hci research and design. the study emphasized the integral role of humor in all human activity, including design and making, humor enables addressing delicate issues, while a lot of sensitivity is needed concerning the fine line between humor and bullying. the study concluded by arguing for the importance of: 1) supporting and facilitating benign forms of humor in the classroom for purposes such as group cohesion, stress relief, facework, and impression management; 2) approaching the classroom as a complex microcosmos that requires a careful study before engaging in practical design and making activities; and 3) a self-reflective as well as a responsible, ethical stance towards one’s own role in cultivating humor and towards the multifarious nature of humor in the classroom. as a result, a practical tool for designers for anticipating and potentially facilitating the emergence, forms and usages of humor as a resource in interaction was proposed. as for the limitations of the study, this analysis shed light on a design and making project in a finnish school with a particular class of teenagers. the power relationships and interaction orders that were natural in that particular environment of pedagogic culture are not generalizable to any context. these results were gained with one specific class, in which the participants were familiar with each other, but into which an unfamiliar research team entered. our situational approach sees humor as a resource in interaction, in which there always is a complex constellation of participants involved and the emergence, forms and usages of humor depend on that. with different kind of constellation of participants, differences can be expected. we particularly point out that cultural aspects (broadly interpreted) need to be recognized, and in several senses. the participants in our study had a shared cultural background in many respects: they were pupils from one class, they knew each other and their teachers, they had quite a similar background as teenagers in oulu, finland. definitely this background influences what is considered humor, the forms it takes and the roles it plays. the research team also had a shared cultural background with the study participants, while only to an extent. even if they have children of the age and some of them also extensive experience as teachers of the age group, there for sure are many aspects of humor that remained unrecognized due to differences in terms of age and, consequently, communities and related discourses. we were able to recognize and interpret many aspects (e.g. memes, language games), while we certainly remained ignorant about others. however, this is not critical as we did not aim to comprehensively capture and classify all instances of humor but rather to understand how it functions as a resource in interaction, the strength of our analysis being in shedding light on the complexity involved. we utilized the versatile, multimodal research material and in-depth collaborative data analysis to ensure the trustworthiness of our interpretations. despite the limitations, we maintain that the results are valuable in other hci contexts as well, particularly in groupwork situations. humor is an inevitable part of human life in general and it acts as a resource in interaction among people of all kinds. with different kinds of participants in groupwork, be it related to design, making, or research on hci, one may expect the emergence of humor as a resource – with adults and children, at work and during leisure time, with people familiar to each other as well as with strangers, in familiar everyday settings as well as in unfamiliar places and spaces. studies exploring the topic in different cultural settings and with differing age groups are warmly welcomed. future research is also needed to provide an even more detailed account of humor as a multimodal resource to see how the interactions unfold moment by moment in design and making activities. based on our results, we recommend directing special attention to the phases critical from the perspective of the emerging design concept and product. in sum, we advocate the situated perspective on humor. this entails exploring how humor emerges as a resource for participants in situ, rather than looking for instances of humor for categorization without context. through a detailed analysis of data, we illustrated how humor, indeed, acted as such a resource. humor was used in building identification, affiliation, mutual relationships and cohesion among the participants. it was also employed as a resource for facework and impression management among pupils engaging with their own familiar class and teachers but also with unfamiliar adult researchers. it was also found to be used in the legitimation of the design ideas and contributing to negotiations of competence and division of labor in an uncertain situation, as the pupils faced a design and making project for the first time, in a way balancing between “being serious” and “arseing around”.",766

Self-Expression by Design: Co-Designing the ExpressiBall with Minimally-Verbal Children on the Autism Spectrum,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376171,"expressing one's thoughts and feelings is a fundamental human need - the basis for communication and social interaction. we ask, how do minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum express themselves? how can we better recognise instances of self-expression? and how might technologies support and encourage self-expression? to address these questions, we undertook co-design research at an autism-specific primary school with 20 children over one school year. this paper contributes six modalities of self-expression, through which children self-express and convey their design insights. each modality of self-expression can occur across two different dimensions (socio-expressive and auto-expressive) and can be of a fundamental or an integrative nature. further, we contribute the design trajectory of a tangible ball prototype, the expressiball, which - through voice, sounds, lights, and motion sensors - explores how tangible technologies can support this range of expressive modalities. finally, we discuss the concept of self-expression by design. minimally-verbal children’s inclusion and participation is often limited in co-design, as many practices focus on verbal collaboration. we investigated how minimally-verbal children on the autism spectrum express themselves, in order to understand how to better include them in co-design. we found that children are continually self-expressing through modalities of words, sounds, bodily movements, touch and gesture, creativity and play. we propose these six modalities of auto- and socio-expression, as a means of tuning into and identifying how a child self-expresses. we contributed a design case study of the expressiball, a playful tangible ball technology, arguing that multimodal forms of technology are needed to support self-expression for this group. self-expression can be fluid, changing, and highly individualised. by learning to identify and support different modalities of self-expression, the researcher or designer can equip themselves with the ability to understand design contributions beyond the verbal, while also supporting agency and choice in participatory contexts.",768
DataQuilt: Extracting Visual Elements from Images to Craft Pictorial Visualizations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376172,"recent years have seen an increasing interest in the authoring and crafting of personal visualizations. mainstream data analysis and authoring tools lack the flexibility for customization and personalization, whereas tools from the research community either require creativity and drawing skills, or are limited to simple vector graphics. we present dataquilt, a novel system that enables visualization authors to iteratively design pictorial visualizations as collages. real images (e.g., paintings, photographs, sketches) act as both inspiration and as a resource of visual elements that can be mapped to data. the creative pipeline involves the semi-guided extraction of relevant elements of an image (arbitrary regions, regular shapes, color palettes, textures) aided by computer vision techniques; the binding of these graphical elements and their features to data in order to create meaningful visualizations; and the iterative refinement of both features and visualizations through direct manipulation. we demonstrate the usability of dataquilt in a controlled study and its expressiveness through a collection of authored visualizations from a second open-ended study. inspired by a vision of data ubiquity and freedom of expression, this work presented dataquilt, a tool to support the creation of rich and organic visualizations, by borrowing and repurposing elements from raster images. this makes visualization authoring accessible to a broader audience that is not necessarily artistically inclined, nor versed in image editing software and visualization programming. our design process was heavily user centered: dataquilt was informed by formative findings from two data driven workshops, and was validated in both a usability study and a creative, free-form exercise study. we found that the tool can be easily appropriated by novices and is expressive enough to allow for significant diversity in visualization designs. more importantly, we found that the tool supported quick exploratory manipulations of designs, which has been noted by some participants as being conducive to creativity. from emerging gaps we have also outlined an agenda for future research. we underscore the importance of improving the expressiveness of bindings to size (beyond vertical bar charts), color (e.g., applying color to parts of the glyph, instead of painting the entire region a flat color) and of positioning (e.g., for spatial clustering). more generally, findings from the formative assessment and evaluation studies revealed great user interest in powerful authoring tools for custom visualizations, that remain nonetheless easy to use and conductive to design refinement and experimentation in order to support creativity.",769
EYEditor: Towards On-the-Go Heads-Up Text Editing Using Voice and Manual Input,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376173,"on-the-go text-editing is difficult, yet frequently done in everyday lives. using smartphones for editing text forces users into a heads-down posture which can be undesirable and unsafe. we present eyeditor, a heads-up smartglass-based solution that displays the text on a see-through peripheral display and allows text-editing with voice and manual input. the choices of output modality (visual and/or audio) and content presentation were made after a controlled experiment, which showed that sentence-by-sentence visual-only presentation is best for optimizing users' editing and path-navigation capabilities. a second experiment formally evaluated eyeditor against the standard smartphone-based solution for tasks with varied editing complexities and navigation difficulties. the results showed that eyeditor outperformed smartphones as either the path or the task became more difficult. yet, the advantage of eyeditor became less salient when both the editing and navigation was difficult. we discuss trade-offs and insights gained for future heads-up text-editing solutions. we presented eyeditor, a novel heads-up, smartglass-based text-editing solution optimized for on-the-go use cases with a combination of voice and manual input. an iterative design process with two controlled experiments gained us the following insights as take-away messages: 1) text content should be presented visually, sentence-by-sentence to optimize users’ text-correction and path-navigation capabilities on the go; 2) overlapping audio and visual output (reading-while-listening) or overloading the screen space with text is highly distracting for on-the-go text-editing and should be avoided; 3) our hybrid solution supports mobility while text-editing better than typing on a smartphone for more complex paths/tasks, until users’ attention span reaches a limit. in conclusion, our paper takes a significant step forward in understanding how to design heads-up interactions for on-the-go text-editing. this is also our first step to establish the feasibility, desirability and viability of using smart glasses as an interactive platform in on-the-go scenarios.",770

"CARoma Therapy: Pleasant Scents Promote Safer Driving, Better Mood, and Improved Well-Being in Angry Drivers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376176,"driving is a task that is often affected by emotions. the effect of emotions on driving has been extensively studied. anger is an emotion that dominates in such investigations. despite the knowledge on strong links between scents and emotions, few studies have explored the effect of olfactory stimulation in a context of driving. such an outcome provides hci practitioners very little knowledge on how to design for emotions using olfactory stimulation in the car. we carried out three studies to select scents of different valence and arousal levels (i.e. rose, peppermint, and civet) and anger eliciting stimuli (i.e. affective pictures and on-road events). we used this knowledge to conduct the fourth user study investigating how the selected scents change the emotional state, well-being, and driving behaviour of drivers in an induced angry state. our findings enable better decisions on what scents to choose when designing interactions for angry drivers. it is dangerous to feel angry while driving a car. anger leads to aggressive driving behaviour [21] and crashes [26]. the 2018 data from the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) [48] suggests that 94% of all road traffic accidents are caused by driver error. 33% of such accidents could be linked to behaviours associated with road rage (e.g. driving too fast, illegal manoeuvre). therefor, a strategy for changing anger to a positive or neutral emotion might become crucial in reducing the number of accidents. our findings suggest that pleasant scents (such as rose and peppermint) could be able to shift the emotion of the driver towards the positive valence. however, in terms of well-being, it would be necessary to customise the choice based on the driver’s preferences. from its properties, the scent of peppermint is more arousing than rose, however, our interview data provides hints that some people might find it calming, as peppermint is associated with comforting experiences. in terms of driving behaviour, our findings show that an unpleasant scent (i.e. civet) might not be a good choice for stimulating angry drivers, as it results in a significantly higher number of collisions. on the contrary, pleasant scents of rose and peppermint could be able to help calm the driver down.",773

Unplatformed Design: A Model for Appropriating Social Media Technologies for Coordinated Participation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376179,"using existing social media technologies as a resource for design offers significant potential for sustainable and scalable ways of coordinating participation. we look at three exemplar projects in three distinct domains that have successfully coordinated participation through the configuration and augmentation of existing social media technologies: participatory future forecasting, participatory health research, and connectivist learning. in this paper we conceptualise social media technologies as material for design, that is, as the raw material with which coordinated participation is realized. from this we develop a model that proposes four material qualities of social media technologies, morphology, role, representation of activity and permeability, and point to how they can be productively employed in the design of coordination of participation. we have presented a model for the unplatformed design of coordinated participation. the model consists of a conceptualization of social media technologies as a design material, with four material qualities morphology, role, representation of activity and permeability and the ways in which they can be manipulated through configuration, hard augmentation and soft augmentation. we have demonstrated the utility of this model from our investigation of three case studies of coordinated participation, and have pointed to the implications of unplatformed design as drawing attention to new resources for design around the appropriation of existing social media technologies, which may have ramifications on both the design of these technologies and on the design of coordinated participation going forward.",776
DoughNets: Visualising Networks Using Torus Wrapping,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376180,"we investigate visualisations of networks on a 2-dimensional torus topology, like an opened-up and flattened doughnut. that is, the network is drawn on a rectangular area while ""wrapping"" specific links around the border. previous work on torus drawings of networks has been mostly theoretical, limited to certain classes of networks, and not evaluated by human readability studies. we offer a simple interactive layout approach applicable to general graphs. we use this to find layouts affording better aesthetics in terms of conventional measures like more equal edge length and fewer crossings. in two controlled user studies we find that torus layout with either additional context or interactive panning provided significant performance improvement (in terms of error and time) over torus layout without either of these improvements, to the point that it is comparable to standard non-torus layout. our studies indicate that torus layout could be a practical technique (not worse than standard graph visualisation techniques) for the tasks tested, but that either redundant context or interactive panning are necessary. the graphs tested were automatically generated using algorithms designed to simulate naturally occurring graphs, but we would like to further evaluate the torus representations in a real-world application and see if it is usable by domain experts. we recognise that testing other types of tasks (such as cluster identification) on larger graphs is an important next step - but it is beyond the scope of this initial study which focuses on precise graph readability and path/edge following. we would also like to see if torus drawing works well for graphs larger than those in our studies (the largest had 15 nodes and 36 edges). we hope that the reduced clutter torus diagrams may work well for tasks particularly important to large networks, and those with complex structures that can benefit from a relaxation of the structure and less line crossings. technically speaking, our stress-minimising torus layout method is the first method we are aware of that is able to layout all graphs (not just graphs limited to a particular genus) on a torus topology. while we can force it to converge we cannot make strong guarantees that it converges to a local optimum. the interactive nature of the algorithm means that a user can guide it to a quite reasonable layout, certainly layouts that were good enough for our study. however, we are interested to see if the combinatorial techniques for layout of restricted classes of graphs on the torus, can be adapted to help us find good starting conditions for our stress-minimising torus layout in order to create a robust and completely autonomous high-quality torus layout.",777
Addressing Cognitive and Emotional Barriers in Parent-Clinician Communication through Behavioral Visualization Webtools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376181,"effective communication between clinicians and parents of young children with developmental delays can decrease parents' anxiety, help them handle bad news, and improve their adherence to proposed interventions. however, parents have reported dissatisfaction regarding their current communication with clinicians, and they face cognitive and emotional challenges when discussing their child's developmental delays. in this paper, we present visualization as a facilitator of parent-clinician communication and how it could address existing communication challenges. parents and clinicians anticipated visualization webtools would aid their communication by helping parents gain a better understanding of their child, acting as objective evidence, and highlighting the strength of the child as well as important medical concepts. in addition, visualization can act as a longitudinal record, helping parents track, explore, and share their child's developmental progress. finally, we propose visualization as a tool to guide parents in their transition from feeling emotional and disempowered to advocating with confidence. while effective parent-clinician communication on developmental delay is important, parents experience an emotional strain as they discuss hopes and fears, developmental concerns, and feelings of distress. in addition to the emotional strain, parents also experience a cognitive burden due to medical jargon or presentation of data that is inaccessible to them. in this paper, we presented data visualization webtools as a method of facilitating parent-clinician communication that could address these communicative challenges. parents and clinicians responded positively to the idea of using visualizations in their conversations and suggested three ways in which they would be useful. two additional roles of visualization in clinical settings were discussed – acting as a longitudinal record of the child’s development and preserving privacy while sharing behavioral data with others. we conclude by suggesting how visualizations could be used in clinical communication while preventing misinformation, and how visualization could empower parents in their journey from dealing with emotions to actively advocating for their child.",778
"""On Finsta, I can say 'Hail Satan'"": Being Authentic but Disagreeable on Instagram",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376182,"we use personality theory to compare self-presentation between multiple instagram accounts, investigating authenticity and consistency. many studies claim social media promote inauthentic self-presentation focused on socially desirable traits. at the same time, affordances suggest that self-presentation should be relatively consistent within one social medium. for 88 participants, we examine personality traits for 'real instagram' ('rinsta') versus 'fake instagram' ('finsta') accounts, comparing these with people's offline traits using mixed-methods. counterintuitively, we find finsta accounts often present socially undesirable traits. furthermore, different accounts on the same social medium reveal quite different styles of self-presentation. overall finstas are more extraverted, less conscientious, and less agreeable than rinstas, although equally neurotic as offline. interviews indicate trait differences arise from differing audience perceptions. a large anonymous rinsta audience promotes a carefully curated self. in contrast, a small but trusted finsta audience can engender more authentic, but negative self-presentation. we discuss design and theory implications. we find large, reliable personality differences between different profiles on instagram and offline. on rinsta, people perceive their personality as less neurotic and extraverted, presenting a positively curated version of themselves. on finsta, people see their personality as more extraverted and neurotic, but less agreeable and conscientious, as a result of presenting a more authentic yet also negative and taboo self. these differences seem to arise from differences in audience, allowing for vastly different self-presentations. results have important implications for the theory and design of social media.",779
Inhaling and Exhaling: How Technologies Can Perceptually Extend our Breath Awareness,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376183,"attending to breath is a self-awareness practice that exists within many contemplative and reflective traditions and is recognized for its benefits to well-being. our current technological landscape embraces a large body of systems that utilize breath data in order to foster self-awareness. this paper seeks to deepen our understanding of the design space of systems that perceptually extend breath awareness. our contribution is twofold: (1) our analysis reveals how the underlying theoretical frameworks shape the system design and its evaluation, and (2) how system design features support perceptual extension of breath awareness. we review and critically analyze 31 breath-based interactive systems. we identify 4 theoretical frameworks and 3 design strategies for interactive systems that perceptually extend breath awareness. we reflect upon this design space from both a theoretical and system design perspective, and propose future design directions for developing systems that ""listen to"" breath and perceptually extend it. we critically analyzed 31 breath-based interactive systems and unveiled four theoretical frameworks that shape design goals and decisions through their differing epistemological commitments. our goal was to deepen the understanding of design approaches employed to perceptually extend breath awareness. to that end, we discussed three design features of these systems that help users in guiding and sustaining attention to their breathing, and how these features support the theoretical frameworks underlying the motivation of the systems. we conclude the paper with two takeaway points regarding design of systems that perceptually extend breath.",780
Reading with the Tongue: Individual Differences Affect the Perception of Ambiguous Stimuli with the BrainPort,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376184,"there is an increasing interest in non-visual interfaces for hci to take advantage of the information processing capability of the other sensory modalities. the brainport is a vision-to-tactile sensory substitution device that conveys information through electro-stimulation on the tongue. as the tongue is a horizontal surface, it makes for an interesting platform to study the brain's representation of space. but which way is up on the tongue? we provided participants with perceptually ambiguous stimuli and measured how often different perspectives were adopted; furthermore, whether camera orientation and gender had an effect. additionally, we examined whether personality (trait extraversion and openness) could predict the perspective taken. we found that self-centered perspectives were predominantly adopted, and that trait openness may predict perspective. this research demonstrates how individual differences can affect the usability of sensory substitution devices, and highlights the need for flexible and customisable interfaces. the research of sensory substitution has much to offer the field of hci, in the form of maximizing information transfer through non-visual displays. our research into perspectivetaking, using the tongue as an interface receptor, shows that when considering tactile displays, it is crucial to strive for the most customizable displays as possible. factors that contribute to making a device as intuitive as possible can range through personal, interpersonal, and spatial; we tested gender, trait openness and extraversion, and camera orientation. we saw that openness may have played a small role in influencing the adopted perspective, but not to a sufficient enough degree to explain the observed variation within the sample. making devices highly customizable would allow for individual differences within a user population, regardless of influencing factors. specifically, regarding the brainport, a simple software update could improve the accessibility for users, particularly in the initial stages of acquiring the device.",781
Bottom-Up Organizing with Tools from On High: Understanding the Data Practices of Labor Organizers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376185,"this paper provides insight into the use of data tools in the american labor movement by analyzing the practices of staff employed by unions to organize alongside union members. we interviewed 23 field-level staff organizers about how they use data tools to evaluate membership. we find that organizers work around and outside of these tools to develop access to data for union members and calibrate data representations to meet local needs. organizers mediate between local and central versions of the data, and draw on their contextual knowledge to challenge campaign strategy. we argue that networked data tools can compound field organizers' lack of discretion, making it more difficult for unions to assess and act on the will of union membership. we show how the use of networked data tools can lead to less accurate data, and discuss how bottom-up approaches to data gathering can support more accurate membership assessments. in this paper we describe how networked data management systems impact the on-the-ground experiences of organizers and what work they must do to actually make the data useful for the union and their own work as organizers. we have described how field organizers negotiate differential levels of data access and calibrate representations of the data to different levels of the union’s organization. we have also shown how organizer’s ability to do these things is potentially impacted by the use of networked data tools, because the tools introduce implementation lag and change the way knowledge is exchanged within the organization, limiting the unique knowledge the field level organizer can leverage in making recommendations. we discuss how the use of these tools constrains the organizer’s ability to efficiently share membership data with activists, potentially hindering data gathering and member activist leadership development. we make recommendations for improvements to the design of systems–to anticipate and support data workarounds through better frontend data migration–and to the role and distribution of technical expertise within the labor union’s organization structure.",782
Move Your Body: Engaging Museum Visitors with Human-Data Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376186,"museums have embraced embodied interaction: its novelty generates buzz and excitement among their patrons, and it has enormous educational potential. human-data interaction (hdi) is a class of embodied interactions that enables people to explore large sets of data using interactive visualizations that users control with gestures and body movements. in museums, however, hdi installations have no utility if visitors do not engage with them. in this paper, we present a quasi-experimental study that investigates how different ways of representing the user (""mode type"") next-to a data visualization alters the way in which people engage with a hdi system. we consider four mode types: avatar, skeleton, camera overlay, and control. our findings indicate that the mode type impacts the number of visitors that interact with the installation, the gestures that people do, and the amount of time that visitors spend observing the data on display and interacting with the system. in this paper, we tackled four challenges for the design of interactive hdi installations: limiting display blindness and attracting people towards the screen; aiding visitors in guessing the gestures and body movements that control the system; keeping users engaged in the interaction; and, sustaining visitors’ attention on the data. our results indicate that the design of the visualization and, in particular, how we represent people on the screen (mode type) impacts the number of visitors that interact with the installation, the gestures that people do, and the amount of time that visitors spend observing the data on display and interacting with the system. future work should investigate whether mode type and interaction type also influence the way in which visitors discuss the data sets on the screen (probably by taking a more qualitative approach in terms of research design).",783
Experiential Qualities of Whispering with Voice Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376187,"we present a research through design project that explores how whispering influences the ways people experience and interact with voice assistants. the research project includes a co-speculation workshop and the use of a design probe, which culminated in the production of a design fiction short film. our design-led inquiry contributes with experiential qualities of whispering with voice assistants: creepiness, trust, and intimacy. furthermore, we present how whispering opens up new dimensions of how and when voice interaction could be used. we propose that designers of whispering voice assistants should reflect on how they facilitate the experiential qualities of creepiness, trust, and intimacy, and reflect on the potential challenges whispering brings to the relation between a user and a voice assistant. in this paper, we presented a rtd project exploring whispering with voice assistants. the research project included an auto-ethnographic experiences with amazon alexa and google home, a co-speculation workshop, the use of a probe as well as a design fiction short film one. our argument for this research is the need to better understand how whispering can change and shape how designers design voice assistants and how whispering affects the user of the voice assistant. the design fiction short film presented in this paper particularises a novel way to communicate with a voice assistant, speculating on the experiences and aesthetics of whispering and how whispering could change the human-computer relation. we contributed with dimensions of whispering, closer to instrumental ideals, and experiential qualities, closer to the aesthetics of interaction. the design fiction short film raises several open-ended questions relating to the experiential qualities, such as: what are the limits to how human-like we want our technologies to be, and how close we want to be with them? can the trust created by an increased sense of empathy from technologies be beneficial to a user, or are we doomed to rely on technology even more in the future? what does this mean to our freedom of choice and expression? these questions are hardly resolved by this research but instead addressed for future speculations to be explored and evaluated in rtd and empirical studies.",784
Quotidian Report: Grassroots Data Practices to Address Public Safety,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274286,"we examine the local data practices of citizens in mexico who use facebook sites as a platform to report crimes and share safety-related information. we conducted 14 interviews with a variety of participants who collaborate as administrators and contributors of these online communities. the communities we examined have two central components: the citizens who crowd-source data about instances of crime in different neighborhoods in and around mexico city, and the administrators of the facebook sites who use the crowd-sourced data to intervene and collaborate with other stakeholders. from our interviews, we identify the community, data, and action practices used by group administrators to collect, curate, and publish information about public safety that would otherwise go unreported. the combination of these practices improves the reputation of the groups on facebook, increases trust, and encourages sustained participation from citizens. these practices also legitimize data gathered by group members as an important grassroots tool for responding to issues of public safety that would otherwise not be reported or acted upon. our findings contribute a growing body of work that aims to understand how social media enable political action in contexts where people are not being served by existing institutions. in this paper, we examined the local data practices of citizens in mexico who use facebook sites as a platform to report crimes and share safety-related information. we identified the community, data, and action practices used by site administrators to collect, curate, and publish data about public safety that would otherwise go un-reported. in order to build their communities, administrators first needed to attract the attention from inhabitants of the affected neighborhoods. then, to keep the community growing, and to sustain meaningful engagement through posting and sharing information, they had to ensure that the information gathered was useful and helped the community act on the specific incidents reported. through a qualitative analysis of interviews with a set of administrators, we were able to reflect on a set of common practices they developed in order to manage their locally-focused online communities, to cultivate data collection and curation within those communities, and to connect both to forms of action that would result in positive outcomes with respect to addressing violent crime. what we show establishes an initial understanding of how the affordances of facebook in particular enable and constrain civic action to address violence and suggests direction for future work that will seek to overcome those limitations while acknowledging the pragmatic reality that commercial social media platforms will continue to dictate many of the terms of social engagement, even at a local level. this work contributes to a growing body of work that aims to understand how social media enable political action in contexts where people are not being served by existing institutions.",785
"Hackers, Computers, and Cooperation: A Critical History of Logo and Constructionist Learning",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274287,"this paper examines the history of the learning theory ""constructionism"" and its most well-known implementation, logo, to examine beliefs involving both ""c's"" in cscw: computers and cooperation. tracing the tumultuous history of one of the first examples of computer-supported cooperative learning (cscl) allows us to question some present-day assumptions regarding the universal appeal of learning to program computers that undergirds popular cscl initiatives today, including the scratch programming environment and the ""fablab"" makerspace movement. furthermore, teasing out the individualistic and anti-authority threads in this project and its links to present day narratives of technology development exposes the deeply atomized and even oppositional notions of collaboration in these projects and others under the auspices of cscw today that draw on early notions of 'hacker culture.' these notions tend to favor a limited view of work, learning, and practice-an invisible constraint that continues to inform how we build and evaluate cscw technologies. “and so it now is up to all of us to carry forth seymour’s legacy—indeed an honorable calling for the idc community,” paulo blikstein stated in the description of the 2017 interaction design and children conference, which had the theme “logo: the next 50 years.” he continued, “it is the legacy of creating for children environments where each will find the gears of their childhood.” blikstein’s message resonates not only with those who experienced the papert-heavy elements of the mit media lab curriculum; we have seen that the ideals that constructionism was built on are ideals that still motivate the technology world more broadly. in particular, we have seen a strong alignment between constructionism and the ‘hacker ethic,’ and the deep convictions that gave rise to this ethos among the hacker community at mit. among other effects, this alignment likely meant that even in the face of contradictory evidence, papert would not revise his theories. to do so would have entailed giving up an ethos that undergirded his professional, if not his personal, identity [7]. these parallels have also helped constructionism keep a strong presence in the technology world, where the ‘hacker ethic’ still resonates, even when some of its lessons fly in the face of best practices in human-computer interaction. thus, constructionism is still celebrated at idc, in design schools, and across cscw and hci—a logic further entrenched by decades of technology design centered on individualized ‘users.’ this paper has shown that the same forces that shaped constructionism also shape the ways that we tend to view computers and the nature of collaboration—and that this ‘hacker ethic’ still has purchase even when evidence points the other way. in so doing, it shows the importance of tracing the ideological histories of contemporary technology projects: these linkages take us back to previous waves of utopian thought that may seem quaint, but have often been translated into contemporary discourse with only cosmetic changes. it also offers an antidote to the allure of constructionism specifically, drawing back the curtain and discussing not only what is wrong with the learning theory, but why it continues to be captivating despite this. one contribution here, then, is not merely a critical history of constructionism, but an examination of some of the underlying forces that make some technology projects “charismatic” [4,7] even when they fail to deliver. moreover, the ubiquity of these individualized, computer-centric perspectives can make it more difficult to envision alternatives for computer-supported collaboration—ones that encode pro-social behavior, mechanisms for countering power differences, or modes of social reciprocity, for instance—or even decenter the computer as a solution for social problems altogether. while the form of such systems is best left to future work, there are some good starting points for considering alternatives in the growing body of critical work on the technology industry. this scholarship details some of the consequences of the anti-authority, every-person-for-themselves, wild-west-like ethos of early computing communities like mit’s hackers (though their utopianism has also been productive in some respects; see e.g. [7,26,126]). that the very logic of the ‘personal computer’ was one of individual empowerment rather than ceding agency to the machine [126] might have allowed us to more easily acquiesce to ceding our agency to algorithmic regulation [6,45,70]. for example, social media and other technology companies have upheld computers as a solution to social problems (e.g. [27]), even as many have abdicated responsibility for actively cultivating positive social spaces online by framing themselves as ‘platforms.’ we are increasingly suffering the consequences of this as these spaces are implicated in hate crimes, antisocial behavior, and even damage to democratic institutions and inclusivity [12,39,46,61,73,95,115]. similarly, a plethora of technology-focused educational companies propose to replace public education with individualized learning, and privately-owned technology-centric charter schools have taken steps toward weakening this public institution and removing pathways of public accountability in education. alongside this, middle-class parents fret about ‘screen time’ in a world where technology use is seen as antithetical to family togetherness and pro-social behavior (e.g. [2,9]). even the industry’s tepid and individualistic reaction to institutionalized racism and sexism—where women are encouraged to simply “lean in” and hateful behavior is framed as “a few bad apples” or even “a problem of both sides”— indicates the depth of this ideological frame. a focus on transparency as a possible solution for some of these social problems within the technology world ignores the problematic interaction between transparency and power (e.g. [12,124]). this ‘solution’ is moreover individualistic and renders us all less receptive to the potentials for collective action to foment change—something toward which technology cultures within silicon valley in particular have long been hostile [17]. still, i find hope in the increasing strength of social movements built on principles of collective action (including occupy wall street, black lives matter, stand with standing rock, and me too/time’s up) which lean on technology platforms to amplify their messages—even if these platforms fail to protect them [125]. while these broader trends are not necessarily traceable directly to papert and constructionism, they are all influenced by the same ideological forebears that made the values of early hacker culture so resonant, and could all benefit from some “troubling” [49] in order to plumb the smooth veneer of their utopian mythologies [4,7,34,72] and understand better how they play out in “the mangle of practice” [96], both historically and contemporaneously. these ideologies tend to favor limited, and limiting, perspectives on not only learning, but computer use more generally, and this constraint continues to inform how we build and evaluate technologies for collaboration and more. while constructionism’s ‘rugged individualism,’ often defined outside or even in opposition to institutions and social relations, is not unique to either the learning theory or to hacker culture, both do valorize it. indeed, it reflects a primacy of individual over collective experiences that has defined the american cultural landscape for at least a century [7,10]. when american norms have played an outsized role in informing technology design, this atomization becomes at least legible (if not actually taken up) across the world—a dominance worth questioning. this paper examines some of the ideological foundations that brought us here as a first step in countering them.",786
"Testing Waters, Sending Clues: Indirect Disclosures of Socially Stigmatized Experiences on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274288,"indirect disclosure strategies include hinting about an experience or a facet of one's identity or relaying information explicitly but through another person. these strategies lend themselves to sharing stigmatized or sensitive experiences such as a pregnancy loss, mental illness, or abuse. drawing on interviews with women in the u.s. who use social media and experienced pregnancy loss, we investigated factors guiding indirect disclosure decisions on social media. our findings include 1) a typology of indirect disclosure strategies based on content explicitness, original content creator, and content sharer, and 2) an examination of indirect disclosure decision factors related to the self, audience, platform affordances, and temporality. we identify how people intentionally adapt social media and indirect disclosures to meet psychological (e.g., keeping a personal record) and social (e.g., feeling out the audience) needs associated with loss. we discuss implications for design and research, including features that support disclosures through proxy, and relevance for algorithmic detection and intervention. caution: this paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss. in this paper we investigate the important role of indirect disclosures on social media for women who have experienced pregnancy loss. we report on interviews with women in the united states who use social media and had experienced pregnancy loss, and make several novel contributions to hci and social computing. we first contribute a typology of indirect disclosure strategies differentiating according to content obviousness, original content creator, and content sharer. we then contribute an understanding of perceived decision factors informing indirect disclosures of sensitive experiences across social media platforms. we find that perceived decision factors are related to the self, audience, platform and affordances, and time. in doing so, we extend the disclosure decision-making framework proposed in prior work to explain direct disclosures of stigmatized experiences on social media to a distinct disclosure behavior: indirect disclosures. we discuss how people intentionally appropriate indirect disclosures on social media to meet psychological and social needs associated with pregnancy loss. we suggest that indirect disclosures can be viewed as a strategy to avoid potential regretful experiences that may stem from direct sensitive disclosures. we also discuss implications for future research and systems. future work should explore specific needs associated with indirect disclosures such as more anonymity, negotiation of emotional trust in social networks, proxy disclosures of sensitive information, and experiments with comment-controlled posts. we discuss implications of this work for algorithmic detection of distress and supportive interventions. in particular, we explore the possibility of detecting more subtle signals in addition to explicit, obvious, and direct disclosures in these algorithms. however, we also raise caveats about needs for privacy, anonymity, and control that may be at odds with such signal detection. the most helpful offerings may be aids that facilitate disclosure and opt-in, self-initiated support seeking and interventions.",787
Acting the Part: Examining Information Operations Within #BlackLivesMatter Discourse,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274289,"this research examines how russian disinformation actors participated in a highly charged online conversation about the #blacklivesmatter movement and police-related shootings in the usa during 2016. we first present high-level dynamics of this conversation on twitter using a network graph based on retweet flows that reveals two structurally distinct communities. next, we identify accounts in this graph that were suspended by twitter for being affiliated with the internet research agency, an entity accused of conducting information operations in support of russian political interests. finally, we conduct an interpretive analysis that consolidates observations about the activities of these accounts. our findings have implications for platforms seeking to develop mechanisms for determining authenticity---by illuminating how disinformation actors enact authentic personas and caricatures to target different audiences. this work also sheds light on how these actors systematically manipulate politically active online communities by amplifying diverging streams of divisive content. this study examined the online activities of social media accounts affiliated with an organization that has been accused of functioning as part of the russian government’s intelligence and media apparatus [61, 62]. we focus on the activities of these accounts—i.e. their information operations— within #blacklivesmatter discourse during 2016, during the lead-up to the u.s. presidential election. our research demonstrates how these accounts presented themselves as “authentic” voices on both sides of a polarized online discourse, modeling pro- and anti-blacklivesmatter agendas respectively. we also show how these accounts converged to undermine trust in information intermediaries like ‘the mainstream media’. this work conceptually sheds light on how information operations use fictitious identities to reflect and shape social divisions. we conclude by highlighting both the need and the challenges of evaluating authenticity within social computing environments.",788
"With Few Eyes, All Hoaxes are Deep",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274290,"quality control is critical to open production communities like wikipedia. wikipedia editors enact border quality control with edits (counter-vandalism) and new article creations (new page patrolling) shortly after they are saved. in this paper, we describe a long-standing set of inefficiencies that have plagued new page patrolling by drawing a contrast to the more efficient, distributed processes for counter-vandalism. further, to address this issue, we demonstrate an effective automated topic model based on a labeling strategy that leverages a folksonomy developed by subject specific working groups in wikipedia (wikiproject tags) and a flexible ontology (wikiprojects directory) to arrive at a hierarchical and uniform label set. we are able to attain very high fitness measures (macro roc-auc: 95.2%, macro pr-auc: 74.5%) and real-time performance using word2vec-based features. finally, we present a proposal for how incorporating this model into current tools will shift the dynamics of new article review positively. in this paper, we describe a specific work context in wikipedia that is struggling. wikipedia, the open encyclopedia is less open today because the new article reviewers are overwhelmed. through examining new article reviewer processes and comparing them to the more-efficient new edit review processes we were able to identify a critical gap: topic routing. in response, we built a topic model using an ontology and folksonomy developed and maintained by wikipedians for organizing content by subject interest (wikiprojects). by combining this folksonomy and a set of already tagged articles, we were able to build a mid_level_categories mapping for training a prediction model. we used word2vec based embeddings to develop a powerful and efficient strategy for feature extraction of topic signal. finally, we tested random forests, gradient boosting classifiers and svms to perform multilabel classification on this dataset and achieved a high level of fitness with both bag-of-words and word vectors. these models are fast and easy to train and use which makes them practical for deployment in a production/real-time environment like that of ores, a machine prediction service that is already widely used by wikipedians. finally, we have proposed how our model and other models that are already deployed in production can be used to re-shape the new article review process in productive ways. given the high level of fitness we were able to attain with basic binary classification methods, we leave the application of more advanced label dependence methods as future work. further we encourage the readers to make use of our wikiprojects ontological abstractions and extend them to other domains for topic modeling. we suspect that the strict hierarchy of the wikiprojects directory along with the wikiprojects tagging can provide a very useful view into wikipedia’s topic spaces where other research has struggled to use categories. such an ontology could be very beneficial for ongoing work exploring wikipedia’s topic coverage bias like that covered by halfaker[7].",789
Framing Effects: Choice of Slogans Used to Advertise Online Experiments Can Boost Recruitment and Lead to Sample Biases,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274291,"online experimentation with volunteers relies on participants' non-financial motivations to complete a study, such as to altruistically support science or to compare oneself to others. researchers rely on these motivations to attract study participants and often use incentives, like performance comparisons, to encourage participation. often, these study incentives are advertised using a slogan (e.g., ""what is your thinking style?''). research on framing effects suggests that advertisement slogans attract people with varying demographics and motivations. could the slogan advertisements for studies risk attracting only specific users? to investigate the existence of potential sample biases, we measured how different slogan frames affected which participants self-selected into studies. we found that slogan frames impact recruitment significantly; changing the slogan frame from a 'supporting science' frame to a 'comparing oneself to others' frame lead to a 9% increase in recruitment for some studies. additionally, slogans framed as learning more about oneself attract participants significantly more motivated by boredom compared to other slogan frames. we discuss design implications for using frames to improve recruitment and mitigate sources of sample bias in online research with volunteers. this is the first paper that examines how advertising online experiments, specifically through the use of slogan framing, attracts different populations. our results suggest that slogans that incentivize participants with the benefit of learning something new about themselves, such as personalized feedback or social comparisons, can substantially increase recruitment compared to slogans appealing to participants’ motivation to support science. additionally, different frames attract participants with different motivations: slogans advertising studies as learning more about oneself attracted participants most motivated by boredom. our results provide new guidelines for researchers attempting to recruit online volunteers while mitigating sample biases.",790
Departing and Returning: Sense of Agency as an Organizing Concept for Understanding Social Media Non/use Transitions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274292,"recent work has identified a variety of motivations for various forms of technology use and non-use. however, less work has closely examined relationships between those motivations and the experiences of transiting among these different forms of use and non-use. this paper fills that gap by conducting a qualitative interview- and diary-based study where participants were asked to deactivate their facebook account. an abductive analysis suggests participants' experiences can be organized under the conceptual umbrella of sense of agency, which refers to an individual's perception that their actions are under their own control. the analysis shows how, across disparate motivations, all participants took actions that increased their own subjective sense of agency, regardless of whether they returned to facebook or not. the discussion applies this conceptual lens to prior studies of technology use and non-use. doing so shows how sense of agency may provide an organizing orientation for understanding subjective experiences of use and non-use. this paper presents analysis of qualitative data from an interview- and diary-based study of participants who took a break from facebook by deactivating their accounts. in contrast to prior work, which provides primarily post-hoc accounts, this study allows for observation of the transitions among different types of non/use as those transition processes unfold. the findings show how, regardless of whether participants returned to facebook or stayed off the site, they took actions that provided them with a greater sense of agency [26, 27, 53, 56]. applying this conceptual lens to other prior work shows how a sense of agency provides a useful means of understanding and organizing disparate motivations that individuals cite for using or not using social technologies in various ways.",791
Efficient Crowd Exploration of Large Networks: The Case of Causal Attribution,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274293,"accurately and efficiently crowdsourcing complex, open-ended tasks can be difficult, as crowd participants tend to favor short, repetitive ""microtasks"". we study the crowdsourcing of large networks where the crowd provides the network topology via microtasks. crowds can explore many types of social and information networks, but we focus on the network of causal attributions, an important network that signifies cause-and-effect relationships. we conduct experiments on amazon mechanical turk (amt) testing how workers can propose and validate individual causal relationships and introduce a method for independent crowd workers to explore large networks. the core of the method, iterative pathway refinement, is a theoretically-principled mechanism for efficient exploration via microtasks. we evaluate the method using synthetic networks and apply it on amt to extract a large-scale causal attribution network. worker interactions reveal important characteristics of causal perception and the generated network data can help improve our understanding of causality and causal inference.",792
#pray4victims: Consistencies in Response to Disaster on Twitter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274294,"this paper studies commonalities in response across disasters in online social networks (osns), specifically twitter. after presenting an algorithm for extracting vocabularies across disasters, we extract type-specific vocabularies for terrorist attacks, earthquakes, and climate-related disasters between 2012 and 2017. disaster type drives vocabulary similarity: terrorism responses mention an ""attack"" and law enforcement, earthquake responses mention the quake and its magnitude, and climate-related responses include safety and requests for aid. across disaster types, tweets regularly mention victims/affected and prayer, consistent with communal coping and social support in crisis aftermath. using disaster-type vocabularies, we study twitter as a proxy for severity, correlating casualties to frequencies in twitter. these vocabularies better correlate with casualties than baseline crisis lexica, especially in western countries. twitter response and casualties diverge at the maximum, and twitter response is stronger in western countries, suggesting perceived severity is driven by additional factors. this paper explores public use of twitter in response to disasters. we develop an algorithm for extracting commonly used vocabularies across a set of related disaster events and show several patterns are shared within each disaster category: responses to terrorism events often mention an “attack” and law enforcement; earthquake responses mention the quake and its magnitude in various languages; and climate-related disaster responses tend to include safety and requests for aid. across all three types of disaster, twitter users also regularly mention victims, the affected, and invocations of prayer, consistent with communication theory on communal coping and social support in the aftermath of crises. using these disaster scripts, we test twitter’s regional biases, results of which suggests twitter response favors western countries, and the most tragic days in terms of casualty do not align with impact on twitter. while other work has studied twitter response to disasters, this work provides a novel analysis into the lexical form and locations of these responses. these results have implications for emergency responders, aid organizations, and crisis informatics researchers, illuminating potential regional biases in twitter and suggesting social support and solidarity behaviors are common across disasters and disaster types. this commonality suggests an underlying motivation may be present in driving indirectly affected populations to respond and engage with each other during times of stress.",793
Supporting Collaboratively Constructed Independence: A Study of Spinal Cord Injury,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274295,"independence is a central concern for people in the care of many chronic conditions. it is often viewed as a goal that can be facilitated with the use of patient data. it is also viewed, especially from the medical side, as something an individual achieves. however, in the lived experience, independence is often a set of collaborative practices. in this paper, we unpack findings from an interview-based study of spinal cord injury (sci) self-care. we found that independence - both functional and in the form of effecting agency - must be co-constructed by the choices and activities of the care network, including the person with disability, caregivers, and clinicians. this collaboratively shaped independence also affects potential collection and use of data in support of self-care. we describe how collaboratively shaped independence informs requirements and constraints for the design of sensor-based networks for self-care in long-term chronic disability. in this study, we examined self-care for individuals with spinal cord injuries. we found that independence is a central concern in sci, and that it has two dimensions: learning and maintaining the physical capabilities to do activities without assistance and asserting a measure of agency over self-care decision making. importantly, we found that independence is a collaborative construct, heavily influenced by the coordinated activities of the care network and its members’ approach to and active help in self-care. we also found that the care network is dynamic in terms of specific members, roles, and activities. the presence of a care network, its importance in maintaining both functional and agential independence, and the dynamic nature of the care network all influence the nature of data sharing and access from sensorbased systems. moreover, because everyone in a care network must also weigh their independence, data provision is often not straight-forward. we found that sensor-based systems to provide data access and data flows must provide for user control over those flows. our methodology had limitations. as we mentioned previously, recruitment was a challenge for us due to the nature of sci. recruitment efforts showed “study fatigue” experienced by individuals with disability because they are not infrequently asked to participate in studies. the difficulty and sensitive nature of the condition itself, as well as geographical dispersion, pose additional challenges. we also would have liked to interview more members belonging to the same care network. however, we found that recruiting a group of connected individuals is oftentimes more difficult; some people in the care network are willing to participate while others are not. we did not want to make this a condition for participation given the other challenges with recruitment. the inclusion of clinicians in the care network further adds hipaa considerations (e.g., the individual with disability must first agree to participate and grant the clinicians permission to disclose information). we believe that the care network is an important unit of analysis, especially in long-term illness or disability, and how to recruit networks as participants to learn how to better support them is an important challenge for cscw/hci. however, we believe we recruited a reasonable crosssection of people with sci, their caregivers, and clinicians. our findings are also limited to the particular context we studied and are therefore not broadly generalizable. however, while the context of our study was sci, we believe that similar kinds of concerns will exist in other chronic care situations. for instance, our supplemental interviews suggest that people with developmental disabilities, disability from stroke, and certain neuromuscular conditions that impose similar constraints and self-care needs have similar care networks and concerns of independence.",794
Investigating Crowd Creativity in Online Music Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274296,"crowd creativity is typically associated with peer-production communities focusing on artistic products like animations, video games, and music, but less frequently to open source software (oss), despite the fact that also developers must be creative to come up with new solutions to their technical challenges. in this paper, we conduct a study to further the understanding of which factors from prior work in both oss and art communities are predictive of successful collaboration - defined as reuse of previous songs - in three different songwriting communities, namely songtree, splice, and ccmixter. the main findings from this study confirm that the success of collaborations is associated with high community status of recognizable authors and low degree of derivativity of songs. in this paper, we applied mixed methods to investigate co-creation behavior in three online music communities and determine which success factors from prior research in both oss and online creative communities are antecedents of reuse. our findings show that, in line with previous findings from research on both oss and creative communities, the perceived quality of an artifact in terms of users’ reactions and authors’ prominence heavily influences the choice to reuse an artifact. we also observed a loss of generativity and interest from other artists in songs that have been already reused. as for the authors’ popularity, we found that social status is used to signal to fellow artists the quality of artifacts, which in turn see an increase in generativity. finally, we provided some suggestions about features that arts and oss online communities may consider borrowing from each other.",795

Complex and Ambiguous: Understanding Sticker Misinterpretations in Instant Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274299,"stickers, though similar in appearance to emoji, have distinct characteristics because they often contain animation, diverse gestures, and multiple characters and objects. stickers can convey richer meaning than emoji, but their complexity and placement constraint may result in miscommunication. in this paper, we aim to understand how people perceive emotion in stickers, as well as how miscommunication related to sticker occurs in actual chat contexts. toward this goal, we conducted an online survey (n = 87) and in-depth interviews (n = 28) in south korea. we found emotional and contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation. in particular, emotion misinterpretation mostly happened due to stickers' ambiguous (multiple) facial/bodily expressions and different perception of dynamism in gestures. in real chat settings, there were also contextual misinterpretations where senders and receivers differently interpret stickers' visual representation/reference, or/and corresponding textual messages. based on these findings, we provide several practical design implications such as context awareness support in sticker interaction. this work investigated sticker misinterpretation in instant messaging. in study 1, we analyzed the emotion ratings on popular stickers (n = 87) to find the patterns of emotion misinterpretation in stickers. in study 2, we collected 140 sticker usage instances from 14 pairs of users and performed an in-depth interview to deepen our understanding about sticker misinterpretation. our results showed that the unique characteristics of stickers such as rich expressiveness and placement constraint are the major contributors of sticker misinterpretation. emotion misinterpretation was largely originating from complexity and ambiguity of emotional expressions in stickers. likewise, complexity and ambiguity of stickers were related to context misinterpretation in terms of visual representation/reference and message correspondence. based on these findings, we provided several practical design implications for mitigating emotion and context misinterpretations such as linking supporting texts and annotating stickers. our work significantly extended prior studies on message interpretation by focusing on stickers, which has attracted enormous attention in recent years. furthermore, our results brought new insights into the importance of contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation in sticker-enabled cmc.",798
SOLVENT: A Mixed Initiative System for Finding Analogies between Research Papers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274300,"scientific discoveries are often driven by finding analogies in distant domains, but the growing number of papers makes it difficult to find relevant ideas in a single discipline, let alone distant analogies in other domains. to provide computational support for finding analogies across domains, we introduce solvent, a mixed-initiative system where humans annotate aspects of research papers that denote their background (the high-level problems being addressed), purpose (the specific problems being addressed), mechanism (how they achieved their purpose), and findings (what they learned/achieved), and a computational model constructs a semantic representation from these annotations that can be used to find analogies among the research papers. we demonstrate that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. these results demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in research communities. in this paper, we introduced solvent, a mixed-initiative system for re-representing and finding analogies between research papers across different domains, in which humans produce lightweight annotations of key aspects of research paper abstracts, and a computational model constructs semantic vectors from the annotations and uses them to finds analogies between the papers. we show that solvent holds promise for efficiently finding analogies between research papers across domains, opening up novel pathways towards computationally augmenting knowledge sharing for scientific progress.",799
"The Internet's Hidden Rules: An Empirical Study of Reddit Norm Violations at Micro, Meso, and Macro Scales",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274301,"norms are central to how online communities are governed. yet, norms are also emergent, arise from interaction, and can vary significantly between communities---making them challenging to study at scale. in this paper, we study community norms on reddit in a large-scale, empirical manner. via 2.8m comments removed by moderators of 100 top subreddits over 10 months, we use both computational and qualitative methods to identify three types of norms: macro norms that are universal to most parts of reddit; meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms that are specific to individual, relatively unique subreddits. given the size of reddit's user base---and the wide range of topics covered by different subreddits---we argue this represents the first large-scale census of the norms in broader internet culture. in other words, these findings shed light on what reddit values, and how widely-held those values are. we conclude by discussing implications for the design of new and existing online communities. we examined community norms on reddit in a large scale, empirical manner. using computational and qualitative methods, we examined over 2 million comments removed over 10 months by moderators of 100 top subreddits. we identified three types of norms within reddit: macro norms which are universal to most parts of reddit; meso norms which are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms which are highly specific to individual subreddits. we argued that our findings represent the first large-scale study of norms across disparate online communities, given the size and diversity of reddit’s user base. we concluded by reflecting on the apparent sharing of norms among distinct online communities, discussing implications for theory, and the design of internet communities more broadly.",800
Data-Driven Proactive Policy Assurance of Post Quality in Community q&a Sites,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274302,"to ensure the post quality, q&a sites usually develop a list of quality assurance guidelines for ""dos and don'ts"", and adopt collaborative editing mechanism to fix quality violations. quality guidelines are mostly high-level principles, and many tacit and context-sensitive aspects of the expected quality cannot be easily enforced by a set of explicit rules. collaborative editing is a reactive mechanism after low-quality posts have been posted. our study of collaborative editing data on stack overflow suggests that tacit and context-sensitive quality-assurance knowledge is manifested in the editing patterns of large numbers of collaborative edits. inspired by this observation, we develop and evaluate a convolutional neural network based approach to learn editing patterns from historical post edits for predicting the need of editing a post. our approach provides a proactive policy assurance mechanism that warns users potential quality issues in a post before it is posted. in this paper, we conduct an empirical study of historical collaborative editing data on stack overflow to investigate the need for proactive quality assurance on q&a sites. our study analyzes various aspects of collaborating editing behaviors and results, including common editing types, users’ attention on different types of edits over time, scale of changes involved in post edits, and patterns of concrete editing operations. based on our empirical observation, we identify four types of post edits (adding code format, adding text format, adding hyperlinks and adding images) that occur frequently by collaborative editing, and at the same time, involve medium-scale of changes that are feasible to predict using machine learning techniques. a cnn-based post-edit recommendation approach has been developed and the cnn model has been trained using largescale post editing data. our evaluation through historical post editing data demonstrates the quality of the recommended post edits by our approach. we discuss the potential benefits of our post-edit recommendation approach for post owners, post editors and novice users. however, deploying our approach on stack overflow may have complicated impacts on social process and collaborative editing, which deserve further studies in the future. we will ask novice and trusted users on stack overflow to try our tool in practice and analyze the feedback to gauge its design. we will also extend our approach to other online q&a sites, similar to or different from stack overflow, to understand the generalizability of our data analysis method and our deep learning approach.",801
Beyond Lingua Franca: System-Facilitated Language Switching Diversifies Participation in Multiparty Multilingual Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274303,"when multiple non-native speakers (nnss) who share the same native language join a group discussion with native speakers (nss) of the common language used in the discussion, they sometimes switch back and forth between common language and their native language to reach common ground. however, such code-switching makes others feel excluded and thus not considered appropriate during formal meetings. to offer nnss more flexibility to code-switch in a group discussion while minimizing the cost of excluding others, we introduced a language support tool that automatically detects a user's spoken language, and then transcribe as well as translate them into another language (common language or nns's native language). in a within-subject study involving 19 quads (two japanese and two chinese) in a collocated setting, participants were asked to perform a series of decision-making tasks with and without the tool. results showed that the language support tool encouraged diverse use of language during a meeting, resulting in more participation from nnss - they increased active initiating behaviors from nnss. although the perceived quality of collaboration became lower, it also elicited helping behaviors among the nns pairs. we conducted a laboratory study to examine the idea of easing nnss’ burden of speaking the common language by alternatively providing a language support tool which allowed them to switch back to their native language depending on conversational contexts. we found that the tool encouraged nns to elaborate their ideas more actively and it becomes an immediate support to nnss. also, we found that although the translation errors may distract the participants, it elicited the helping behaviors such as oral clarification from fluent bilingual speakers which may fill the linguistic gap between nss and nnss. consequently, our results suggest that by allowing language shifting behaviors of nnss with flexibility in multiparty multilingual communication, it has the potential to cultivate more diverse idea as well as enhance group dynamics by increasing the variety of language selection and potentially the participation of nnss. our findings also open up an opportunity to consider future design decision of involving backchannels and behavioral-aware support in multilingual communication.",802
'Staged for Living': Negotiating Objects and their Values over a Porous Boundary,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274305,"we describe more than 19 months of ethnographic fieldwork with people who have embraced minimalism, a lifestyle movement focused on reducing modern life's clutter. we found that for minimalists, the home is a central but porous site for making and staging their values around objects. the home's porous boundary allows minimalists to reinforce their values around objects for others and themselves, but it also necessitates adopting strategies to assert their values when objects---entangled with others' values---move in and out the boundaries of the home. drawing from our fieldwork, we introduce the concept of the porous boundary. ""porosity"" impels us to consider the coupling of objects with values as we do boundary practices for the home. a porous boundary perspective, we argue, can open new design spaces in the development of novel technologies for the home. inspired by our minimalists’ practices, we found that home is a space with a porous boundary. focusing on the porosity of these borders provides a macroscopic perspective of how a place (e.g., the home) is intertwined with a heterogeneous and related set of actors, objects, practices, and values. future cscw research on domains with so-called alternative values may find the concept of porous boundary useful. it encourages researchers to articulate value practices but also how certain values are bound to multiple places and objects. methodologically, this suggests that we ought to see what practices over the boundary of home make one’s home experiences meaningful. given that smart home technologies now connect our home to the outside world and have potentially provided more opportunities for transferring things (physical or digital) over the boundary of our home, the concept of porous boundary may be even more relevant as it simultaneously becomes less visible [42]. we may focus our gaze on where these porous areas and surfaces are digitally situated in our daily practices. porous boundaries, we hope, point to further promising concepts and frameworks that will help us understand and support re-configurations enacted by people on the objects and spaces that are tied to one another via the values and priorities of people’s lives.",803
Crowd Coach: Peer Coaching for Crowd Workers' Skill Growth,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274306,"traditional employment usually provides mechanisms for workers to improve their skills to access better opportunities. however, crowd work platforms like amazon mechanical turk (amt) generally do not support skill development (i.e., becoming faster and better at work). while researchers have started to tackle this problem, most solutions are dependent on experts or requesters willing to help. however, requesters generally lack the necessary knowledge, and experts are rare and expensive. to further facilitate crowd workers' skill growth, we present crowd coach, a system that enables workers to receive peer coaching while on the job. we conduct a field experiment and real world deployment to study crowd coach in the wild. hundreds of workers used crowd coach in a variety of tasks, including writing, doing surveys, and labeling images. we find that crowd coach enhances workers' speed without sacrificing their work quality, especially in audio transcription tasks. we posit that peer coaching systems hold potential for better supporting crowd workers' skill development while on the job. we finish with design implications from our research. this paper introduced crowd coach, a chrome extension to promote workers’ personal skill building by supporting peer coaching while on the job. crowd coach uses peer micro-advice and a twofold reputation mechanism to help workers personally improve their skills. crowd coach differentiates itself from prior work by helping crowd workers to improve their skills by depending on the crowd workers themselves rather than requesters or experts. moreover, crowd coach innovates on related work by embedding the help mechanisms within tasks so that work growth can be achieved while on the job, and by supporting workers to provide and receive the coaching through micro-coaching snippets rather than lengthy and comprehensive assistance. in this way, our system grounds itself in the practical concerns and constraints that both crowd workers and requesters face, such as limited time and resources available to devote to improving skills or task workflow designs. the present study sets the stage for future systems that focus on creating rewarding labor experiences where crowd workers can personally grow while on the job.",804
Will Too Many Editors Spoil The Tag?: Conflicts and Alignment in Q&A Categorization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274307,"q&a websites compile useful knowledge through user-generated questions and responses. many q&as use collaborative tagging systems to improve search and discovery while distributing the work of categorizing and organization throughout the community. although early work on collaborative tagging questioned whether consistent categorization schemes could emerge from large groups with little to no coordination, empirical studies have found surprising coherence among users' tags. we build on this research by testing whether coherence emerges in tag usage on q&as, a more challenging context, focusing in particular on mismatches in the specificity of tags (basic level disagreement). we found that some users shifted toward more specific tag usage over time slightly increasing conflict, but that moderators were instrumental in helping to resolve some of this conflict. this study highlights the importance of learning and moderation in the development of coherence in collaborative tagging systems. q&a websites compile useful knowledge through user-generated questions and answers. collaborative tagging has been adopted by some q&as to make it easier to label, organize, and find content. we investigated whether users naturally tended toward more consistent tag usage over time as would be expected if users were assimilating conceptual structures [10]. we found low level inconsistency in tag usage that persisted and got slightly worse over time as some users shifted toward more specific tags. we found that moderation helped to reduce inconsistencies. we argue that there may be widespread benefit to allowing moderators to edit tags.",805
Living in the Present: Understanding Long-Term Content Referencing in Enterprise Online Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274308,"successful online communities accumulate large amounts of long-term content. however there has been little quantitative, theoretically-motivated exploration of how communities organize such content, nor which community members take responsibility for active organization. we examine one aspect of long-term content organization through link behavior, also exploring role differences between enterprise community leaders and members in the context of life-cycle community models. we first classify how content is linked within posts, identifying usage patterns that organize information within and outside communities. we next present an exploratory quantitative analysis of 2,010 communities including 428,476 posts and 1,246,570 links. we show paradoxically that although mature communities accumulate substantial content, organizing that content using links decreases over time. further analyses suggest that this arises from a recency bias, with communities being focused on current content. our results also challenge descriptive lifecycle community models, which propose that regular community members adopt greater responsibility over time. we explore explanations for our findings and implications including new tools that encourage responsibility for active organization, as well as methods for members to revisit critical content. this paper presents new results about how community behaviors change over time. although this study is exploratory in assessing content referencing, our findings are nevertheless counterintuitive in light of current theory. as expected, content increased over time and members took responsibility for creating such content. however contradicting current life-cycle model predictions, referencing did not increase as content accrued and instead decreased as communities aged. furthermore, members did not assume responsibility for content referencing. we explored one possible explanation for this lack of content referencing, finding that communities tend to focus on very recent content, making it less important for them to focus on managing older material. we describe new tools and leader practices that might better utilize older content.",806
Engaging with Health Data: The Interplay Between Self-Tracking Activities and Emotions in Fertility Struggles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274309,"self-tracking data is often seen as a means to reflect and achieve a goal, usually focusing on positive insights and actions. lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. we explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. we qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. we found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. we discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. we also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area. in this study, we identified that women perform fertility self-tracking with different types of engagement. we identified five different types: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component. we suggest that this interplay characterizes the different types of engagement with data women may have when self-tracking for fertility. these findings are aligned with previous literature describing the possible negative consequences of tracking, such as feelings of failure, making a health condition more visible, frustration, and obsession. they also provide a deeper understanding of how different people engage differently with health data: ones with more positive attitudes while others have more problematic relationships with their data. such intense and emotionally consuming experiences with self-tracking need to be considered in the design of self-tracking tools and interventions. as other health conditions may have similarly complex, unique, and uncertain manifestations (e.g., eating disorders [16]), it is possible that a similar process may occur in different health contexts. we approached how the broader issues of the culture of quantification impact on the relationship between the goal, the tracking activities, and the emotional experience of tracking in this context. finally, we discussed possible implications derived from these findings that could help alleviate the problematic aspects we described.",807
Spacetime Characterization of Real-Time Collaborative Editing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274310,"real-time collaborative editing (rtce) is a popular way of instrumenting cooperative work on documents, in particular on the web. little is known in the literature yet about rtce usage patterns in the real world. in this paper we study how a popular rtce editor (etherpad) is used in the wild, digging into the edit histories of a large collection of documents (about 14 000 pads), retrieved from one of the most popular public instances of the platform, hosted by the wikimedia foundation. the pad analysis is supported by a novel conceptual model that allows to label edit operations as ""collaborative"" or not depending on their distance-in edit position (space), edit time, or spacetime (both)-from edits made by other authors. the model is applied to classify all edits from the pad corpus. classification results are further used to characterize the collaboration behavior of pad authors. findings show that: 1) about half of the pads have a single author and hence witnessed no collaboration; 2) collaboration on common document parts happens often, but it happens asynchronously with authors taking turns in editing; and 3) simultaneous editing of common document parts happens very rarely. these findings help in revisiting early rtce design decisions (e.g., the granularity of conflict management in rtce protocols) and give insights on how to address novel needs (e.g., end-to-end encryption and offline editing). we have studied documents edited on one of the largest public instances (14 000 pads) of the etherpad real-time collaborative editor (rtce) to characterize real-time collaboration on the web. the characterization is based on a novel model that captures collaboration along three dimensions: time (whether collaboration happens simultaneously or almost so), space (whether collaboration happens in nearby parts of the document), and spacetime (both). our findings show real-time collaboration happens, but not very often. a very limited number of pads witness simultaneous collaboration on nearby document areas; time collaboration (on unrelated document parts) is more frequent; space collaboration on the same document portions (but during editing sessions that are far apart in time) is the most common. these results are influenced by the public setting of the studied etherpad instance. it is possible that private deployments would show larger amounts of collaboration within more coordinated teams working on shared documents. on the other hand the study of a freely accessible service shed some light onto real-time collaboration in the wild.",808
Evaluating Crowdworkers as a Proxy for Online Learners in Video-Based Learning Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274311,"crowdsourcing has emerged as an effective method of scaling-up tasks previously reserved for a small set of experts. accordingly, researchers in the large-scale online learning space have begun to employ crowdworkers to conduct research about large-scale, open online learning. we here report results from a crowdsourcing study (n=135) to evaluate the extent to which crowdworkers and mooc learners behave comparably on lecture viewing and quiz tasks---the most utilized learning activities in moocs. this serves to (i) validate the assumption of previous research that crowdworkers are indeed reliable proxies of online learners and (ii) address the potential of employing crowdworkers as a means of online learning environment testing. overall, we observe mixed results---in certain contexts (quiz performance and video watching behavior) crowdworkers appear to behave comparably to mooc learners, and in other situations (interactions with in-video quizzes), their behaviors appear to be disparate. we conclude that future research should be cautious if employing crowdworkers to carry out learning tasks, as the two populations do not behave comparably on all learning-related activities. in conclusion, we here report on a study which employs crowd workers to evaluate the extent to which they can serve as reliable proxies for mooc learners for the purposes of both learning analytics research and testing. specifically, we find that (i) the crowd workers behave comparably to mooc learners in their engagement with standard lecture videos, (ii) the two populations do not engage similarly with in-video quiz question materials, and (iii) the two populations perform comparably on assessment/quiz activities. we also contribute vidquiz, the open-source in-video quizzing software created to carry out the experiment.",809
Coloring in the Links: Capturing Social Ties as They are Perceived,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274312,"the richness that characterizes relationships is often absent when they are modeled using computational methods in network science. typically, relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. the lack of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to categorize relationships. here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. we first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. these ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. we also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. overall, by proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking applications.",810
'Too Gay for Facebook': Presenting LGBTQ+ Identity Throughout the Personal Social Media Ecosystem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274313,"most us social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. for lgbtq+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. these choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. moreover, many lgbtq+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their lgbtq+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. this combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of lgbtq+ and other potentially stigmatized users. we adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 lgbtq+ social media users. we find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their ""personal social media ecosystems"" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their lgbtq+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time. in this paper, we have applied an ecological lens to lgbtq+ self-presentation, allowing us to see that it is the range of options provided by an individual’s personal social media ecosystem that ensures both the necessary protections from stigmatization as well as the access to social support needed by lgbtq+ individuals. our contributions provide guidance for researchers and designers alike in further efforts to understand and support lgbtq+ individuals in achieving their self-presentation goals, and lay the groundwork for future in-depth work on lgbtq+ populations in an increasingly diversifying social media space.",811
Score-Group Framing Negatively Impacts Peer Evaluations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274314,"how does group membership framing affect the feedback students provide learners? this paper presents two between-subjects experiments investigating the effect of ingroup/outgroup membership on effort spent in peer evaluations, and whether the group membership criterion type affects quality and stringency of evaluation. two peer-review assignments were implemented in two separate classes. in the first study, students were nominally grouped by location they sat in class and non-nominally grouped by current class score; each was asked to review an ingroup and outgroup peer assignment. a second study randomly assigned students to one of four group types (random, score, motivation, and location); student reviewed two ingroup assignments. in both studies, score-grouped students graded their peers more stringently than students grouped by location. these studies illustrate for system designers the impacts of group framing - and the disclosure of that-in peer review tasks. this project made headway in understanding the effect of disclosing features on effort spent helping peers. although we hypothesized, based on social-psychological research, that an ingroup/outgroup effect may be easily elicited with any feature of similarity, this turned out not to be the case. features matter, and our results highlight the complicated effects of being grouped by score. the fact that we found similar effects in two different classes suggests that they might be generalizable to peer-review in a classroom/course setting. in our study, although students took part in a physical class, students reviewed their peers anonymously online. it remains to be tested how this would compare to peer reviews in a fully online classroom, or even other online forums such as stack exchange or wikipedia, where formative feedback is encouraged. in a completely online setting, where location in space is not shared, emphasis on location would likely have an effect. ultimately, if disclosing features can reduce social distance between peers in reciprocal social computing tasks like peer review, then easy interventions may be put in place to increase learner-centered collaboration in online environments, where the goal is large-scale, highquality assessment.",812
Understanding Gender Equity in Author Order Assignment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274315,"women remain underrepresented in many fields in computer science, particularly at higher levels. in academia, success and promotion are influenced by a researcher's publication record. in many fields, including computer science, multi-author papers are the norm. evidence from other fields shows that author order norms can influence the assignment of credit. we conduct interviews of students and faculty in human-computer interaction (hci) and machine learning (ml) to determine factors related to assignment of author order in collaborative publication. the outcomes of these interviews then informed metrics of interest for a bibliometric analysis of gender and collaboration in research papers published from 1996 to 2016 in three top hci and ml conferences. based on our findings, we make recommendations for assignment of credit in multi-author papers and interpretation of author order, particularly in regard to how this area affects women. this project has proven invaluable for all authors of this paper, who have changed their practices on authorship decisions. one now tracks how often she is last author compared to co-authors to ensure she speaks up if necessary. another hasraised the question of how to trade last position when students are co-advised. all faculty authors train their students to be proactive about authorship discussions, including providing scripts for requesting credit. while we have found these strategies to be transformational, further research on mitigating bias in authorship is important future work.",813
Shifting Expectations: Understanding Youth Employees' Handoffs in a 3D Print Shop,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274316,"as digital fabrication technology has become mainstream, the increased demand for 3d printed objects has created a new market for professional outsourcing. given that most of this work does not require advanced training, and is an appropriate entry-level manufacturing job, there is an exciting opportunity to employ youth already skilled in ""making"" and interested in technology to do this work as an after-school job. the combination of this new technology and workforce calls for new workflows that streamline client-driven digital manufacturing. however, the limitations of current digital fabrication technology and youth schedules require that this work be spread between multiple shifts, necessitating employees to coordinate and handoff their work. we investigated the collaborative practices between youth employees while working on client jobs in a 3d print shop during one year of field work. in this paper, we describe instances where youth employees successfully, and unsuccessfully, handed off work between shifts and identify techniques utilized by youth to support successful handoffs, including: counting physical artifacts, using asynchronous chat programs, and documenting work. we then discuss the impact of the print shop manager's presence, physical characteristics of 3d prints, and youth perspectives of work on the selection of and effectiveness of these techniques. finally, we offer lessons learned from successful handoffs in the print shop and recommendations for supporting youth in collaborative work environments.",814
The Influence of Friends and Experts on Privacy Decision Making in IoT Scenarios,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274317,"as increasingly many internet-of-things (iot) devices collect personal data, users face more privacy decisions. personal privacy assistants can provide social cues and help users make informed decisions by presenting information about how others have decided in similar cases. to better understand which social cues are relevant and whose recommendations users are more likely to follow, we presented 1000 online participants with nine iot data-collection scenarios. some participants were told the percentage of experts or friends who allowed data collection in each scenario, while other participants were provided no social cue. at the conclusion of each scenario, participants were asked whether they would allow the described data collection. our results help explain under what circumstances users are more or less likely to be swayed by the reported behavior of others in similar scenarios. for example, our results indicate that when friends denied data collection, our participants were more influenced than when friends allowed data collection. on the other hand, participants were more influenced by experts when they allowed data collection. we also observed that influence could get stronger or wear off when participants were exposed to a sequence of scenarios. for example, when experts and friends repeatedly allowed data collection in scenarios with clear risk or denied it in scenarios with clear benefits, participants were less likely to be influenced by them in subsequent scenarios. as iot devices become more widespread and people confront choices about personal data collection, the number of decisions to be made may be overwhelming. in this paper, we explored the impact of social cues in helping people make faster, more informed decisions regarding their privacy. to understand how people will be influenced by social cues from privacy experts and friends, we conducted an online user study with 1000 mechanical turk participants, randomly assigned to five conditions. we presented each participant with nine hypothetical data collection scenarios. in four conditions, we showed participants what percentage of experts or friends allowed the data collection. in the fifth condition, we described the data collections without any additional information. our statistical results confirmed the impact of social cues on people making privacy decisions. we also found that the extent of this influence is dependent on various factors such as the level of privacy protectiveness of influencers’ decisions and the strength of the social cues. we believe our findings can inform the design of more effective privacy assistants.",815
Do Students' Learning Behaviors Differ when they Collaborate in Open-Ended Learning Environments?,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274318,"researchers have long recognized the importance of using technology to support students' collaboration in learning and problem solving tasks. recently, there has been a lot of research in capturing and characterizing student discourse and how they regulate each other when they perform learning tasks in pairs or in small groups. in this paper, our goal is to dive a little deeper into how students collaborate, and the learning behaviors they exhibit when working in pairs on a learning by modeling task, while also teaching a virtual agent in the betty's brain system. we report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. the results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. a differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. the differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually. this study examined how working in pairs influenced students’ learning behaviors and performance when they worked on model building tasks in the betty’s brain environment, where students learn by teaching (i.e., building a model for) their virtual agent. this study sought to determine the effect of collaboration on students’ learning behaviors and their effect on their performance, both in terms of their pre-post learning gains and their map scores. the current study found that collaboration has a significant effect on students’ learning gains, and the collaborating students outperformed the students who worked individually in terms of their learning gains on the science content, as well as their ability to build correct maps. this result confirms the beneficial effects of collaboration on learning that has been reported in the literature [25,27,37]. with respect to the learning behaviors, the dsm analyses indicate that the collaborating students adopt a more systematic approach to learning and model building (demonstrated by their ability to work together in co-constructing knowledge). this can be partially attributed to the fact that collaboration had a positive effect on their ability to analyze their quiz results and debug do students’ learning behaviors differ when they collaborate? 49:17 proceedings of the acm on human-computer interaction, vol. 2, no. cscw, article 49, publication date: november 2018. their map (self-assessment behavior as seen in patterns 1 and 2 of dsm analyses). when combined with pattern 7 generated by the dsm analyses, becomes clear that the collaborating students are better able to interpret quiz results, and turn them into effective map correcting actions or reading actions that lead to correct addition of links to their maps. the effectiveness of map edits in table 3 further supports this result. the example conversations reported in this paper further confirm the stronger debugging abilities of the collaborating students. on the other hand, students working individually ended up spending a lot of time in reading the resources. however, they were unable to translate their reading to model building and learning of the science content. johnson and johnson [18] argue that synthesis of multiple perceptions might result in better solutions and decisions to complex problems. these results match similar behavioral patterns found in a past study on collaborative learning by emara, et al. [11] and kapur [21]. similar differences were also found between high and low performing students working individually [22,24].",816
Watch Me Code: Programming Mentorship Communities on Twitch.tv,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274319,"live streaming-an emerging practice of broadcasting video of oneself in real time to an online audience-is often used by people to portray themselves engaged in a craft such as programming. viewers of these 'creative streams' gather to watch the streamer at work and to interact with the streamer and other audience members. however, little is known about how creative streamers engage with their audience, how their viewership communities form and operate, and how creative streams may support learning. in this study, we used a participant-observer method to study game development streams on the live streaming site twitch.tv. we found that live streams support the growth of learning-focused communities that mentor both the streamer and each other during and after streams. we show the influence of streamers in creating a space for learning and motivating learners. finally, we discuss implications for online education and communities of practice. in this paper, we have presented an overview of the mentoring communities that are found on the live streaming platform twitch.tv. in this study, we used a participant-observer method to study creative streams on the live streaming site twitch.tv. these communities are formed through the actions of the streamer, who draws in viewers through their ability to provide insightful comments while performing. mentorship is not provided solely by the streamer, as a stream’s viewers takes it upon themselves to mentor both the streamer and other viewers. this culture of mentorship and assistance is then extended beyond the stream to asynchronous chat servers such as discord that support further beyond the temporal and subject scope of the stream. we have discussed implications for online learning communities and cscl, and suggested avenues for further research and design in this emerging area of research.",817
Beyond the Coded Gaze: Analyzing Expression of Mental Health and Illness on Instagram,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274320,"in cscw and hci, work examining expression of mental health and illness on social media frequently aims to classify content, quantify visual trends, and predict user states. this approach to analysis is a form of the coded gaze, a type of algorithmic 'way of seeing' coined with respect to artificial intelligence techniques. the coded gaze classifies content through researcher- and machine-labeled categories, relying on a series of theoretical assumptions that influence how values pertaining to mental health and illness become inscribed in data. in this paper, we build upon this research to support alternative methods of data interpretation. we join manual collection of instagram posts with semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography over six months to understand how instagram users express their experiences with mental health and illness. we argue that individuals negotiate claims to mental health and illness through visibility and signaling, the boundaries between mental health and illness are porous and blurred, and reposting and remix are a form of participation. we discuss practical and ethical implications for studying the expression of mental health and illness online. expression of mental health and illness is an active negotiation of content production and circulation. individuals on instagram make their experiences visible through sharing original, reposted, and remixed content without necessarily making claim to a particular relationship with mental health or illness. the ways that individuals choose to make their experiences salient is influenced by platform practices and social norms, as well as broader cultural representations of mental health and illness. hci and cscw scholars frequently employ the coded gaze to analyze online content related to mental health and illness. though beneficial for a variety of reasons, such as the ability to recognize depression and predict suicidal ideation, application of the coded gaze assumes generalizable findings that deemphasize individual experience; a static, objective record of content that does not explore alternative interpretations; and an implicit goal of classification. we argue that the coded gaze restricts opportunities for understanding the intricacies of how individuals claim, signal, and make visible experiences with mental health and illness. by diversifying methodological approaches in this space, we can open up new avenues for research and support complimentary ways of understanding how individuals express mental health and illness online.",818
'Welcome' Changes?: Descriptive and Injunctive Norms in a Wikipedia Sub-Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274321,"open online communities rely on social norms for behavior regulation, group cohesion, and sustainability. research on the role of social norms online has mainly focused on one source of influence at a time, making it difficult to separate different normative influences and understand their interactions. in this study, we use the focus theory to examine interactions between several sources of normative influence in a wikipedia sub-community: local descriptive norms, local injunctive norms, and norms imported from similar sub-communities. we find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior. we contextualize these findings through member interviews, and discuss their implications for both future research on normative influence in online groups and the design of systems that support open collaboration. in this paper, we drew on the focus theory to examine interactions between different sources of normative influence on answering behavior of 7060 contributors to a wikipedia q&a forum for new editors, the teahouse. specifically, we examined local descriptive and injunctive norms, their congruent effects, and conflict between different sources of normative influence due to membership overlap in a similar q&a community, the help desk. our findings across 4 years of data suggest that exposure to both explicitly defined injunctive norms and indirect exposure to injunctive norms through corrective practices have more persistent association with pro-normative behavior than exposure to behavioral examples (descriptive norms) alone; that exposure to descriptive norms is only associated with pro-normative behavior when norm-associated phenomena are easily identifiable as such; and that the highest level of normative compliance is associated with exposure to both explicitly defined injunctive norms and plentiful recent examples of pro-normative behavior. additionally, we find that experience in a related sub-community with conflicting norms can be associated with either less or more pro-normative behavior, depending on the type of norm conflict experienced. we contextualized our findings with interviews with teahouse participants, and presented implications both for theory building on normative influence in online collaborative communities, as well as practical implications for the design and management of these communities.",819
Women (Still) Ask For Less: Gender Differences in Hourly Rate in an Online Labor Marketplace,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274322,"in many traditional labor markets, women earn less on average compared to men. however, it is unclear whether this discrepancy persists in the online gig economy, which bears important differences from the traditional labor market (e.g., more flexible work arrangements, shorter-term engagements, reputation systems). in this study, we collected self-determined hourly bill rates from the public profiles of 48,019 workers in the united states (48.8% women) on upwork, a popular gig work platform. the median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. however, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. to better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities. as technology increasingly supports work across the globe, online labor marketplaces have been of increasing interest to cscw and social computing researchers (e.g., [70, 73]). our results lead our understanding of the relationship between gender, bill rate-setting, and earned revenue in these marketplaces. in this study, we found that women ask for only 74% of what men ask for in median hourly bill rate on upwork, one of the largest online labor marketplaces in the world. however, we also found that by working more hours at these lower rates, women earn as much or more than men overall. the current work contributes to a developing body of research by gender studies scholars in cscw and social computing who study barriers to participation in other social technologies, such as peer production sites, online communities, social media, and blogs [31, 42, 59]. as scholars, we must better understand how women decide on hourly rates and hours worked if online labor marketplaces are to more equally engage women in the paid labor force.",820
"Gender, Feedback, and Learners' Decisions to Share Their Creative Computing Projects",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274323,"although informal online learning communities are made possible by users' decisions to share their creations, participation by females and other marginalized groups remains stubbornly low in technical communities. using descriptive statistics and a unique dataset of shared and unshared projects from over 1.1 million users of scratch-a collaborative programming community for young people-we show that while girls share less initially, this trend flips among experienced users. using bayesian regression analyses, we show that this relationship can largely be attributed to differences in the way boys and girls participate. we also find that while prior positive feedback is correlated with increased sharing among inexperienced users, this effect also reverses with experience or with the addition of controls. our findings provide a description of the dynamics behind online learners' decisions to share, open new research questions, and point to several lessons for system designers. we present our study with the hope that future work will look more deeply into the factors that influence sharing behaviors. we also hope that future studies will extend our work’s encouraging suggestion that female participation becomes more robust once an initial barrier to engagement is overcome as well as examining our surprising result that motivational feedback such as “love its” is associated with less future sharing of creative artifacts. although our study is restricted to one community, we hope that future researchers will apply and extend our questions and methods in the context of other online communities, leading to a more general understanding of gender disparity in technology and in learner engagement in informal online communities more broadly",821
To Label or Not to Label: The Effect of Stance and Credibility Labels on Readers' Selection and Perception of News Articles,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274324,"social media sites use different labels to help users find and select news feeds. for example, blue feed, red feed, a news feed created by the wall street journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. to combat the spread of fake news, facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. to systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. we found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption. overall, our results suggest that stance and credibility labels can affect people’s news article selection and perception in ways that deviate from their original intended effects. as a result, such effects are often neglected in online news platform designs. thus, social media designers should be cautious about using labels. our results show that, consistent with previous studies, assigning credibility labels to articles (such as ""disputed"") is not effective for combating fake news. interestingly, stance labels, which are often designed to help people find information, may have undesirable effects on facilitating the spread of fake news. specifically, we found that stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they seem to lower people’s perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. without systematic evaluation, those unintended, yet undesirable, effects of stance labels could not have been detected. in fact, our results suggest that stance labels may reinforce users’ existing beliefs and indirectly exacerbate polarization of social opinions.",822
Social Photo-Elicitation: The Use of Communal Production of Meaning to Hear a Vulnerable Population,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274325,"we report on an initial ethnographic exploration of the situation of sex-trafficking survivors in nepal. in the course of studying trafficking survivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental organization in nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the survivors by making the technique more communal. bringing sociality to the forefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as individuals, allowing them to speak. we make three contributions to research. first, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit values in sensitive settings. second, we present the complex circumstances of the survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a ""new normal"". third, our work adds to hci and cscw literature on understanding specific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can support reintegration of survivors in society. the values that the survivors hold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but important social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid reintegration. we created a social photo-elicitation activity as part of trying to understand the situation of sextrafficking survivors in nepal. the activity positioned the intentions of the authors – especially those from nepal – in a “proto-reflective” situation; that is, taking action with an intervention will perturb the system, but inaction is problematic. we learned about their complex relationships with crafting and their envisioned reintegration with the society at large. a first read of the findings from this work might suggest that there is no design space for responsible technological intervention with this community in this setting. in fact, a closer read of the findings along with a broader interpretation of what cscw research is about supports the further investigation of the particulars of the sister-survivors’ longer-term needs and their relationship to social technologies. that is, they are embedded in a social network of great complexity that is in turn embedded in a highly structured, but fraught culture; the challenge now is to configure technological social infrastructure in that context. our findings obey the cscw and hci mandates of encountering people in the complexities of their lived lives. the complexities of these lived lives deepen our understanding of the limited but important social capital that the survivors hold. beyond the particulars of this situation, it is crucial that cscw continue to grow in its understanding of ethical responsibilities and its contemplation of what elements of a situation or a design allow ethical intervention. the two key questions in design are, “how do you know what is the right thing to do?” and “how do you know when you have done it?”",823
Eight Observations and 24 Research Questions About Open Source Projects: Illuminating New Realities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274326,"the rapid acceleration of corporate engagement with open source projects is drawing out new ways for cscw researchers to consider the dynamics of these projects. research must now consider the complex ecosystems within which open source projects are situated, including issues of for-profit motivations, brokering foundations, and corporate collaboration. localized project considerations cannot reveal broader workings of an open source ecosystem, yet much empirical work is constrained to a local context. in response, we present eight observations from our eight-year engaged field study about the changing nature of open source projects. we ground these observations through 24 research questions that serve as primers to spark research ideas in this new reality of open source projects. this paper contributes to cscw in social and crowd computing by delivering a rich and fresh look at corporately-engaged open source projects with a call for renewed focus and research into newly emergent areas of interest. practitioners often acknowledge aspects of the new realities in open source projects but few examine their full scope of consequence. ideals from the free software movement persist and continue to guide individual engagement in open source projects, which is noble but can be out of step with the emerging open source project reality. project maintainers must understand the significance of the supply chains their projects become part of to avoid exposing not only immediate users but national infrastructure projects to failures that can stem from interconnectedness. organizations seeking to balance the use of open source software in their internal innovation streams must adjust internal practices to account for open source project health risks and how its engagement impacts a larger software ecosystem. open source projects and their vast ecosystems, as a whole, are facing a collective action challenge born of the tensions between its past and the emerging future. the new realities of open source projects are shifting who benefits from the wealth generated in these projects. we observed many new realities (e.g., changes of membership from volunteers to paid employees to a lack of effective market mechanisms). these new realities are interrelated and cannot be solved by a single open source project or organization, but provide new forms of engagement in the design and distribution of software. new mechanisms of practice and research can be developed to incentivize the development of healthy projects that produce secure software, incentivize the engagement of volunteers who are not affiliated with an organization, and continue to leverage the traditional and successful open source development model. this paper is intended to serve as a starting point for these new conversations.",824
Fake Cures: User-centric Modeling of Health Misinformation in Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274327,"social media's unfettered access has made it an important venue for health discussion and a resource for patients and their loved ones. however, the quality of information available, as well as the motivations of its posters, has been questioned. this work examines the individuals on social media that are posting questionable health-related information, and in particular promoting cancer treatments which have been shown to be ineffective (making it a kind of misinformation, willful or not). using a multi-stage user selection process, we study 4,212 twitter users who have posted about one of 139 such ""treatments"", and compare them to a baseline of users generally interested in cancer. considering features capturing user attributes, writing style, and sentiment, we build a classifier which is able to identify users prone to propagate such misinformation at an accuracy of over 90%, providing a potential tool for public health officials to identify such individuals for preventive intervention. in this paper we present a case study of health misinformation on social media by examining twitter users involved in propagating alternative medicines claiming to treat or cure cancer. through a multi-stage process including machine learning, crowdsourcing, and heuristics, we select users who are likely to be real people, and who post on one of 139 such topics. we find that these users are likely to use more sophisticated language, and circulate in health domain prior to posting a rumor, but are not likely to be personally involved in the illness. our findings suggest that cancer treatment misinformation may be spread not by patients, but by other actors. more research needs to be done to ascertain motivations, tactics, and impact of such accounts. finally, the dataset collected for this study presents a highly-curated resource for the research community’s future studies on the topic of health misinformation.",825
GuessTheKarma: A Game to Assess Social Rating Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274328,"popularity systems, like twitter retweets, reddit upvotes, and pinterest pins have the potential to guide people toward posts that others liked. that, however, creates a feedback loop that reduces their informativeness: items marked as more popular get more attention, so that additional upvotes and retweets may simply reflect the increased attention and not independent information about the fraction of people that like the items. how much information remains? for example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item a to item b if item a had hundreds of upvotes on reddit and item b had only a few? we investigate using an internet game called guessthekarma that collects independent preference judgments (n=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. unlike the rating systems that dominate social media services, guessthekarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence ratings. overall, reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by guessthekarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the time. however, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. similarly, imgur view counts for the images were poor predictors except when there were orders of magnitude differences between the pairs. we conclude that popularity systems marked by feedback loops may convey a strong signal about population preferences, but only when comparing items that received vastly different popularity scores. in this work we presented guessthekarma, a survey tool that can be used to explore the performance of social rating systems, and an analysis of two social media rating systems, reddit votes and imgur views. through its tournament style setup, the guessthekarma game removed many of the social influence effects and algorithmic, design, and ranking biases, that have been previously reported in social rating systems research. therefore, discrepancies between guessthekarma-judgments and reddit scores (or imgur view counts) can be primarily explained by the presence of socio-technical influence dynamics in the the reddit scores and imgur view counts. the results suggest that reddit vote-scores and imgur view-counts are relatively poor predictors of user preference except when one image has a much higher score than the other. for example, images with scores in the top 5% of scores within their subreddit paired with an image whose score falls within the bottom half of all scores were preferred by guessthekarma players almost 90% of the time. unsurprisingly, we found that individual players were less accurate predictors, performing slightly better than random. however, we also did not find significant differences between players of varying expertise or familiarity with the platforms or communities we compared. finally, we found no difference in the accuracy of active members of a subreddit, even small subreddits, compared to those respondents that did not use reddit.",826
Personalized Motivation-supportive Messages for Increasing Participation in Crowd-civic Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274329,"in crowd-civic systems, citizens form groups and work towards shared goals, such as discovering social issues or reforming official policies. unfortunately, many real-world systems have been unsuccessful in continually motivating large numbers of citizens to participate voluntarily, despite various approaches such as gamification and persuasion techniques. in this paper, we examine the influence of personalized messages designed to support motivation as asserted by the self-determination theory (sdt). we designed a crowd-civic platform for collecting community issues with personalized motivation-supportive messages and conducted two studies: a pair-comparison experiment with 150 participants on amazon's mechanical turk and a live deployment study with 120 university members. results of the pair-comparison study indicate applicability of sdt's perspective in crowd-civic systems. while applying it in the live system surfaced several challenges, including recruiting participants without interfering with general motivations, the collected data exhibited similar promising trends. in this paper, we investigated the effects of motivation-supportive messages in crowd-civic systems. informed by the self-determination theory, we created several messages for a number of tasks related to idea generation for social communities. in two studies, we gathered evidence for the applicability of this theory as well as a possibility of personalization. this work has implications for the design of systems that benefit from engagement from diverse groups. especially in crowdcivic systems, this may increase not only overall participation, but also representativeness and inclusiveness.",827
"Navigating the Healthcare Service ""Black Box"": Individual Competence and Fragmented System",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274330,"cscw research has investigated how people at workplace and organizational settings gain knowledge required for work, but less is known regarding how ""organizational outsiders"" obtain knowledge about organizations and organizational landscapes that provide a service. gaining knowledge about service landscapes is particularly difficult because they are often complex, non-transparent, and fragmented. we address this gap through an interview study of 19 u.s. parents regarding how they navigated health services for their young children, and how they gained competence in navigation practices. we describe a similar process all participants went through including four inherently iterative stages: seeking and integrating knowledge, decision-making, encountering breakdowns, and repairing and reflecting. we further elucidate what constitutes navigational competence, or the creation of resources about how to navigate, for our participants. we discuss how our study could advance understanding of navigation practices, and the importance for hci design to support these complex yet essential navigation practices and the accumulation of navigational competence. in this paper, we reported on 19 parents’ navigation practices and accumulation of navigational competence in coping with the healthcare system in the united states. we described a common process that participants undertook as they frequently encountered navigational breakdowns that were inherently interorganizational. by discussing navigational competence in depth, we hope to contribute to not only research on patient work/expertise/strategy/literacy in the domain of healthcare, but also deepen the understandings of the work that organizational outsiders have to perform in order to cope with complex, opaque, and fragmented service landscapes. there are urgent needs for more research on this topic in a variety of domains, as well as design activities that could support individuals’ navigation.",828
Productivity in an Era of Multi-Teaming: The Role of Information Dashboards and Shared Cognition in Team Performance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274331,"when and why do information dashboards enhance team productivity? we explore this question in the context of project teams whose members have to work across multiple teams at the same time. we expected multi-teaming, especially that involving a high variety in team members, would have a negative effect on team performance by impairing a team's transactive memory system (tms), a critical form of shared cognition allowing members to keep track of who knows what. further, we expected the use of an information dashboard with member skills could combat the harmful effects of high-variety multi-teaming. to test our hypotheses experimentally, we developed an online game (knowledge worker's dilemma) that simulates the coordination decisions that professionals face in app development teams. results show multi-teaming hurt team performance by reducing tms; use of an information dashboard benefited high-variety teams and, surprisingly, hurt the performance of low-variety teams. potential explanations and implications are discussed. although multi-teaming is a wide spread reality for today’s project teams, we have only begun to understand its impact on team performance, and the role that information systems can play in mitigating those effects. in an effort to empirically study this phenomenon, we developed an online game that simulated the decisions team members face in a multi-teaming context. the results of our empirical study indicated it would be beneficial to work with a consistent set of core team members (i.e., maintain low multi-teaming variety) and that higher levels of multi-teaming hurt teams’ ability to coordinate and perform. we also found evidence that a team’s transactive memory system (tms), a critical form of shared cognition mediates the negative effects of increasing multi-teaming variety on performance. finally, our study suggests that using information dashboards to offset these effects is helpful for high-variety multiteaming contexts. for low-variety teams, it may be better to focus on team fundamentals like equality of team member contribution to achieve good performance.",829
Social Media as Social Transition Machinery,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274332,"social media, and people's online self-presentations and social networks, add complexity to people's experiences managing changing identities during life transitions. i use gender transition as a case study to understand how people experience liminality on social media. i qualitatively analyzed data from transition blogs on tumblr (n=240), a social media blogging site on which people document their gender transitions, and in-depth interviews with transgender bloggers (n=20). i apply ethnographer van gennep's liminality framework to a social media context and contribute a new understanding of liminality by arguing that reconstructing one's online identity during life transitions is a rite of passage. during life transitions, people present multiple identities simultaneously on different social media sites that together comprise what i call social transition machinery. social transition machinery describes the ways that, for people facing life transitions, multiple social media sites and networks o""en remain separate, yet work together to facilitate life transitions. existing on multiple social media sites simultaneously is central to many people’s online social lives today [98]. however, presenting different versions of self to different networks is especially important for people during life transitions, as i have shown in this study. transition work cannot be done all in one online place. my concept of social transition machinery describes the ways that different social media sites and networks remain separate, yet work together, to enable people to carry out different types of transition work and draw from different types of support networks. using this concept, i contribute a new understanding of how people experience liminality on social media, and argue that reconstructing one’s online identity on social media is a rite of passage. my description of liminality is a substantial departure from previous literature, which characterized transitional periods in people’s lives as neutral or identity-less – which, in my view, further marginalizes transitional populations. instead, i argue that existing multiply on different social media sites and remaining connected to several different networks is far from a neutral experience. to best facilitate online transition work, social media sites should be designed to foster social connectivity while acknowledging the importance of social media site separation.",830
Bot Detection in Wikidata Using Behavioral and Other Informal Cues,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274333,"bots have been important to peer production's success. wikipedia, openstreetmap, and wikidata all have taken advantage of automation to perform work at a rate and scale exceeding that of human contributors. understanding the ways in which humans and bots behave in these communities is an important topic, and one that relies on accurate bot recognition. yet, in many cases, bot activities are not explicitly flagged and could be mistaken for human contributions. we develop a machine classifier to detect previously unidentified bots using implicit behavioral and other informal editing characteristics. we show that this method yields a high level of fitness under both formal evaluation (pr-auc: 0.845, roc-auc: 0.985) and a qualitative analysis of ""anonymous"" contributor edit sessions. we also show that, in some cases, unflagged bot activities can significantly misrepresent human behavior in analyses. our model has the potential to support future research and community patrolling activities. we built a bot detection model for wikidata based on behavioral and other informal contribution characteristics. our model improves upon current methods of bot recognition in peer production that rely on contributors formally and explicitly denoting bots as such. we ensured our model performed well by formally evaluating it against registered user data and by qualitatively evaluating its ability to perform with anonymous edits where formal, explicit signals for testing are not available. by applying to this latter dataset, we begin exploration into an understudied and potentially important dynamic in wikidata and other peer production communities. through application of our model, we find that while some studies of contributor behavior may need to be concerned about unidentified bots affecting results, most likely do not. our findings are also important to the wikidata community as they indicate that bot approval processes have not been completely effective. finally, we provide our train/test data, code, and model hyper-parameters for others to use in their work.",831
Sociocultural Practices that Make Microfinance Work: A Case Study from Sri Lanka,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274334,"microfinance is an inherently social process. over the years, it has emerged as an essential means for providing financial services to the ""underbanked"" population in developing countries. this paper presents a qualitative study focused on understanding existing cooperative practices associated with microfinance in rural sri lanka. through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and visits to microfinance centres, we found that microfinancing involves much more than financial transactions, rather it is strongly habituated in the sociocultural fabric of communities. our findings show that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance. using examples from the field, this paper discusses the importance of these factors in microfinance activities and contributes an elaborated account of cooperative practices that support microfinance processes. we also highlight how the local sociocultural structures and practices shape the way microfinance processes are being handled. we contribute towards an in-depth understanding of such practices that can be useful for microfinance institutions (mfis) and technology designers. consequently, we advocate for an intermediary path for technology interventions where technology and people work together rather than technology replacing people. in this paper, we presented a qualitative study conducted as a part of a larger project which aims to design technological tools to support the underbanked community from rural sri lanka. the objective of this study was to understand the role of sociocultural practices in supporting microfinance work. our findings showed that there were several sociocultural practices embedded into the way microfinance sector functions in sri lankan rural regions and these practices play a significant role in supporting microfinance process. we gathered data by conducting semi-structured interviews, field visits and group discussions over a period of seven months. our investigations in the microfinance sector revealed that the microfinance workflow relies heavily on several socially-habituated cooperative practices. specifically, we identified that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance, all of which play a significant role in making microfinance work. using examples from the field, we have illustrated the sociocultural cooperative practices of microfinance sector and how they are employed to build relationships. even though researchers agree that microfinance is a collaborative achievement between various stakeholders, there is a need to go beyond the procedural and transaction-oriented focus on dealing with microfinance work. based on our findings, we were able to understand the importance of human elements in the current practices of microfinance. hence, we suggest that technology designers should focus on identifying ways where technology and people can work together instead of designing systems to replace people hoping to reduce cost and increase efficiency. to the best of our knowledge, the insights presented in this paper have not been previously reported in the domain of technology design for the underbanked. we hope that these insights will inspire technology designers to design tools that fit meaningfully with the above-studied sociocultural practices of this community which are critical to the sri lankan microfinance sector.",832
Going Beyond Obscurity: Organizational Approaches to Data Anonymization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274335,"anonymization is viewed as a solution to over-exposure of personal information in a data-driven society. yet how organizations apply anonymization techniques to data for regulatory, ethical or commercial reasons remains underexplored. we investigate how such measures are applied in organizations, asking whether anonymization practices are used, what approaches are considered practical and adequate, and how decisions are made to protect the privacy of data subjects while preserving analytical value. our findings demonstrate that anonymization is applied to data far less pervasively than expected. organizations that do employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice is a complex socio-technical process that relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations. organizational decision-making about appropriate approaches and the management of responsibility can result in workarounds necessary to negotiate the technical complexity. although anonymization has been featured in public discourse, emphasized in private data regulations, and emerged as an active object of academic inquiry in multiple disciplines, of the nearly 70 organizations we approached far fewer indicated that they use these approaches than we had expected. at the same time, many organizations that did engage with anonymization treated it as a sensitive topic and thus refused to answer our questions or limited the information they provided due to security concerns. approaches to anonymization among our respondents and their reasons for granting access were diverse. they expressed significantly different opinions, echoing some of the ongoing debates about the viability of data anonymization. perspectives ranged from general optimism about the possibilities of emergent anonymization methods to complete dismissal of conventional anonymization practices and the policies that regulate them. at the same time, even among participants that did agree to engage with our study, their willingness to disclose details of organizational anonymization approaches varied. among those who offered complete answers, some asked for confidentiality, with their answers handled anonymously. in these cases, their disclosure of information went through a legal and security approval process. curiously, the stated reasons for reticence in this kind of disclosure were explained less by concerns about loss of competitive advantage and more by additional security measures to limit the potential for de-identification attacks. this sort of anonymization-by-obscurity is potentially problematic and warrants deeper consideration. while some responses cited security reasons for not providing more information, reasons for treating the subject as sensitive are not easy to pinpoint. such attitude can also be motivated by the data anonymization methods being seen as trade secrets, which could be the case for example where industrial research is being done, or alternatively by concerns about gaps between actual practices and legal or internal policies, potentially resulting in a lack of control over the data, which could negatively affect their reputation if published. to us this suggests a significant immaturity of practice and the variability of policies around application of anonymization mechanisms and disclosure of these policies troubles the expectation of trust increasingly required for the data economy to operate.",833
Who is Addressed in this Comment?: Automatically Classifying Meta-Comments in News Comments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274336,"user comments have become an essential part of online journalism. however, newsrooms are often overwhelmed by the vast number of diverse comments, for which a manual analysis is barely feasible. identifying meta-comments that address or mention newsrooms, individual journalists, or moderators and that may call for reactions is particularly critical. in this paper, we present an automated approach to identify and classify meta-comments. we compare comment classification based on manually extracted features with an end-to-end learning approach. we develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple classifiers on a comment dataset of the large german online newsroom spiegel online and the ""one million posts"" corpus of der standard, an austrian newspaper. both optimized classification approaches achieved encouraging f0.5 values between 76% and 91%. we report on the most significant classification features with the results of a qualitative analysis and discuss how our work contributes to making participation in online journalism more constructive. with the emergence of user comments in online news media, news organizations are in need of tools to cope with the number of user comments. researchers have found that journalists appreciate user feedback that, for instance, reports errors in articles, include additional information on a topic, or contain critique addressed to the quality of an article. in this paper, we present a preliminary approach to automatically identify and classify comments not (only) related to the news article but comments that address, for instance, the media company, a journalist, or a community-moderator. we call these comments “meta-comments”. by using a supervised machine learning approach, we achieved encouraging results with f0.5 scores between 76% and 91%. we found similarities between the most significant features of 2 large datasets. we computed word and comment embeddings based on 11 million german user comments for enriching text features, deriving semantic features, and transfer learning. the end-toend learning approach outperformed the traditional approach on the “one million posts” dataset. we gained further qualitative insights into the content of automatically identified meta-comments. finally, in our discussion, we highlight the training of word embedding models based on user comments as an important step for applying our approach to other languages. we further discuss use-cases for stakeholders, as e.g. considering the users’ forum feature requests when further developing the news comment section.",834
Structure or Nurture?: The Effects of Team-Building Activities and Team Composition on Team Outcomes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274337,"how can instructors group students into teams that interact and learn effectively together? one strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with ""good"" compositions such as skill diversity. another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. our work synthesizes these two strands of research. we describe an experiment (n=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. in two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. we collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. we also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. we distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments. this work reported the results of an experiment comparing the effects of team formation strategies and team-building activities on team performance, satisfaction, and psychological safety in two university courses. teams formed to achieve the composition defined by the instructor in each course did not show a statistical difference on any measure relative to teams formed randomly. this result suggests that instructors should be less concerned with fine-tuning the configuration in the tool, and should instead emphasize the value of the criteria-based approach, so that students perceive teams to be equally capable of performing well. we also found that results from industry teams (e.g., [11]) regarding psychological safety’s link to performance did not generalize to the student teams studied. this finding suggests that though activities aimed at fostering psychological safety may have practical benefits for student teams, instructors should not expect these activities to boost performance or psychological safety. more work is needed to further clarify what kinds of activities can improve psychological safety and in what contexts psychological safety impacts team performance.",835
Emotional Biosensing: Exploring Critical Alternatives,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274338,"emotional biosensing is rising in daily life: data and categories claim to know how people feel and suggest what they should do about it, while cscw explores new biosensing possibilities. prevalent approaches to emotional biosensing are too limited, focusing on the individual, optimization, and normative categorization. conceptual shifts can help explore alternatives: toward materiality, from representation toward performativity, inter-action to intra-action, shifting biopolitics, and shifting affect/desire. we contribute (1) synthesizing wide-ranging conceptual lenses, providing analysis connecting them to emotional biosensing design, (2) analyzing selected design exemplars to apply these lenses to design research, and (3) offering our own recommendations for designers and design researchers. in particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires. we call for critically questioning and generatively re-imagining the role of data in configuring sensing, feeling, 'the good life,' and everyday experience. emotional biosensing technologies promote a particular normative vision of ‘the good life’ limited by a focus on individual wellness, self-improvement, and workplace productivity. while there is positive potential here, these limitations point to opportunities for broadening the design space with emotional biosensing. we sketched how a broad shift from abstract representationalism to sociomaterial performativity opens critical alternatives for emotional biosensing: (section 3.2) rather than treating data as something immaterial to be represented, attending to the materiality of data sensing and display opens new possibilities for interpretation and experience. (3.3) building on interpretation and experience, treating sensing/display not as passive representations but as active performances or responses offers opportunities for social meaning making and experiential, expressive displays. emotional biosensing designs should treat affect, feeling, and emotion as embodied, dynamic, and fluid rather than abstract, static, discrete categories. (3.4) continuing this performative shift, reframing affect from a kind of abstract information to affect as socially enacted in interaction adds sociocultural nuance to emotional biosensing. we call for humility in the emotional knowledge claims made by design, leaving more open to human interpretation, adaptation, and contestation. (3.5) shifting further to posthumanist performativity, we outline how agential realism can help emotional biosensing designs attend to how materials shape meaning-making and prompt reflexivity about which materials, people, or categories are assumed to be separate. attending to biopolitics (3.6) calls for embracing a diversity of voices and ways of knowing with emotional biosensing. we suggest designs with intentionally reduced authority are worth exploring, and that emotional biosensing designs can leverage negative affect as a resource for building community, support, and collective action. (3.7) finally, reframing affect and desire as preindividual, we call for emotional biosensing designers to critically reflect on the desires our designs legitimize, and on the societal structures that make those desires seem appropriate. we argue that emotional biosensory designs should prioritize care, affirmation, respect, and recognition over self-improvement. designs can encourage people to trust themselves to be ‘emotionally good/safe enough’ with room to explore and change rather than only seek selfimprovement according to predefined norms. more broadly, designs should explore a wide range of alternative desires with emotional biosensing.",836
Technology to Support Immigrant Access to Social Capital and Adaptation to a New Country,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274339,"the key to successful adaptation for immigrants in a new country is their social capital, or those resources embedded in their social networks. research suggests that information and communication technologies (icts) foster immigrants' social capital and facilitate their adaptation. however, it is unclear how recent immigrants use icts to develop social capital and how this supports their adaptation needs. we performed semi-structured interviews with thirteen recent immigrants and five long-term immigrants. we found that icts and technology-mediated connections: (1) easily addressed immigrants' settlement needs, (2) minimally addressed their financial and cultural needs, and (3) were not used to address their emotional needs. to support recent immigrants' adaptation, we suggest ways for icts to (1) reduce uncertainty about meeting local-born populations, (2) foster reciprocity among immigrant communities, and (3) facilitate safe resource exchanges. drawing from a series of interviews with thirteen recent immigrants and five long-term immigrants, our work provides insights into the opportunities for icts to support the successful adaptation of new immigrants to the u.s. we found that the recent immigrants from our study connected to public ethnic groups online to address settlement and financial needs. we also found that private online groups facilitated active resource exchange among ethnic communities, which could strengthen immigrant communities. prior research suggests that connections to local-born populations are beneficial to thrive in a new country. indeed, hybrid community platforms, which are typically ethnically diverse, offered opportunities for immigrants to make connections with the local-born. however, participants had lower trust in users and resources on other icts with ethnically diverse users such as craigslist and pnas. we contribute implications for strengthening relationships between immigrants and local-born populations. building from prior research, we suggest reducing uncertainty around meeting the local-born, fostering reciprocity among immigrant communities, and facilitating safe resource exchanges.",837

Digitizing Monetary Ecologies: Intended and Unintended Consequences of Introducing a Financial Management App in a Low-Resource Setting,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274341,"this paper reports on the changes in the monetary ecology around loan payments by auto rickshaw drivers shortly after the introduction of a mobile app in karnataka, india. a for-profit, social enterprise facilitates loans for purchasing auto rickshaws. the mobile app was designed and implemented to provide accurate, timely loan information for drivers, to support the collaborative work of loan collection payment, and streamline the workflows of the organization. in this paper, we report on the initial experiences with the app, and argue that its introduction led to a tighter coupling of the actors involved and moved control to the back office, which especially impacted the pre- and at-transaction interactions of the monetary ecology. the paper reflects on how these changes impact adoption and use of the app and suggests a number of changes to the design which might address the observed problematics. at this stage, where the app has just been implemented, it is too early to assess and deliver a verdict upon the long-term effects of digitizing financial transactions and financial inclusion. what the case does show is that digitizing financial transactions and introducing mobile technology changed the monetary ecology in important ways. the app, together with the backend system, transformed the processes involved in loan payment workflow from disparate artefacts which provided little support for beneficiaries and intermediaries into a more coherent, accurate, up-to-date integrated system. the app also provided the opportunity for updated information to be available at-transaction. the front-end and back-ends of the ecosystem became more tightly coupled which entailed a crucial role for those in charge of the back-end system, since it controlled the updating and verifying information. ideally, this ongoing digitizing of the ecology of monetary transactions will achieve the aim of improving the involved actors’ situation: field agents work is supported by the app and enables them to handle more drivers and strengthen their role as ‘financial counsellors’; drivers may succeed in completing their loans and become owners of auto rickshaws more likely. twu as a social, for-profit organization, obtains a more efficient administration, can grow and increase the number of drivers and field agents they support, and thus overall work towards improving drivers’ and field agents’ lives. however, as we have shown in the discussion of the ‘p’s, ‘2’s, of the changes in the monetary ecology, and suggestions for design implications, digitization does not do it per se, and much relies on the specific configuration of the system.",839
Debiasing Desire: Addressing Bias & Discrimination on Intimate Platforms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274342,"designing technical systems to be resistant to bias and discrimination represents vital new terrain for researchers, policymakers, and the anti-discrimination project more broadly. we consider bias and discrimination in the context of popular online dating and hookup platforms in the united states, which we call intimate platforms. drawing on work in social-justice-oriented and queer hci, we review design features of popular intimate platforms and their potential role in exacerbating or mitigating interpersonal bias. we argue that focusing on platform design can reveal opportunities to reshape troubling patterns of intimate contact without overriding users' decisional autonomy. we identify and address the difficult ethical questions that nevertheless come along with such intervention, while urging the social computing community to engage more deeply with issues of bias, discrimination, and exclusion in the study and design of intimate platforms. as intimate platforms grow, so does their influence on individual and structural outcomes within and beyond the intimate sphere. intimate platforms already intervene in and mediate our private lives and decisions, and many are beginning to work toward counteracting the bias and discrimination that often manifests in our most personal interactions. recognizing the serious challenges and opportunities presented by design practices among popular intimate platforms, we advocate for the social computing research community to engage intimate platforms as critical structures for intervening in and reflecting on issues of bias, discrimination, and exclusion. exploring structural rather than individual interventions allows us to move beyond debates of individual preference versus discrimination, and toward conversations that are concerned with how these preferences and practices arise and are sustained. future research in the social computing community could work towards building design mechanisms that mitigate extant forms of discrimination, developing theories and practices of design that unsettle entrenched preferences, and unpacking complex legal and policy questions about the design, operation, and role of intimate platforms.",840

Vicariously Experiencing it all Without Going Outside: A Study of Outdoor Livestreaming in China,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359127,"the livestreaming industry in china is gaining greater traction than its european and north american counterparts and has a profound impact on the stakeholders' online and offline lives. an emerging genre of livestreaming that has become increasingly popular in china is outdoor livestreaming. with outdoor livestreams, streamers broadcast outdoor activities, travel, or socialize with passersby in outdoor settings, often for 6 or more hours, and viewers watch such streams for hours each day. however, given that professionally produced content about travel and outdoor activities are not very popular, it is currently unknown what makes this category of livestreams so engaging and how these techniques can be applied to other content or genres. thus, we conducted a mixed methods study consisting of a survey (n=287) and interviews (n = 20) to understand how viewers watch and engage with outdoor livestreams in china. the data revealed that outdoor livestreams encompass many categories of content, environments and passersby behaviors create challenges and uncertainty for viewers and streamers, and viewers watch livestreams for surprising lengths of time (e.g., sometimes more than 5 continuous hours). we also gained insights into how live commenting and virtual gifting encourage engagement. lastly, we detail how the behaviors of dedicated fans and casual viewers differ and provide implications for the design of livestreaming services that support outdoor activities. this work examined viewers’ experiences when watching outdoor livestreams and engaging with outdoor livestreamers’ communities within the context of china. the results from the survey and interviews revealed that a diverse range of outdoor activities are streamed on popular livestreaming platforms in china and that different categories of outdoor livestreams engage different segments of the viewing audience (i.e., dedicated, casual, and light viewers). dedicated viewers watch an outdoor livestream for excessive periods of time in one sitting (e.g., 5 hours), and are vicariously engaged with streamers’ content and communities, while casual and light viewers are less engaged, and watched more for information and personal fulfilment. we also found that, for dedicated viewers, danmaku is used to create a concurrent side show during a livestream, and it can sometimes be more engaging than the livestream itself. gifting behaviors were also found to be deeply rooted in the chinese cultural element of “paimian”. by identifying unique challenges that viewers and streamers encounter within the realm of outdoor livestreaming, e.g., contextual unpredictability and privacy concerns, the results of this work should help improve the design of livestreaming platforms and enable the community to better understand the influence and effects of such livestreaming content on viewing audiences, both inside and outside of china.",845
Customizations and Expression Breakdowns in Ecosystems of Communication Apps,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359128,"the growing adoption of emojis, stickers and gifs suggests a corresponding demand for rich, personalized expression in messaging apps. some people customize apps to enable more personal forms of expression, yet we know little about how such customizations shape everyday communication. since people increasingly communicate via multiple apps side-by-side, we are also interested in how customizing one app influences communication via other apps. we created a taxonomy of customization options based on interviews with 15 ""extreme users"" of communication apps. we found that participants tailored their apps to express their identities, organizational culture, and intimate bonds with others. they also experienced expression breakdowns: frustrations around barriers to transferring personal forms of expression across apps, which inspired inventive workarounds to maintain cross-app habits of expression, such as briefly switching apps to generate and export content for a particular conversation. we conclude with implications for personalized expression in ecosystems of communication apps. we studied customization practices in ecosystems of communication apps to understand the value of customizations in the context of cmc and to gather insights that inform novel designs for increased personalization of mobile communication. through interviews with 15 “extreme users” of communication apps, we collected stories about 22 customization options across nine different apps (e.g., changing the color of chat bubbles in messenger). we created a taxonomy of customization options in mobile communication apps, which we used to characterize the reported customizations according to their visibility (whether their results are visible to others or not), ownership (whether they can be controlled by the user or by other contacts as well) and scope (whether they affect a single conversation, a whole app , or any conversation throughout the ecosystem of apps). we found that participants tailored their apps to better express their identities, their organizational culture, and their intimate bonds with others. participants relied on customization options (e.g., chatbots, custom-made stickers) and means of expression (e.g., emojis, reactions) of particular apps to shape personal forms of expression, which they tried transferring to other apps for maintaining consistent expressions of their identities and bonds with others. however, this was often not possible, leading to expression breakdowns: frustrated attempts to transferring personal forms of expression between apps, mainly due to app-exclusive customization options, customization options with different designs across apps, and app-exclusive means of expression that, despite not being customizable, helped establishing personal forms of expression. to overcome these breakdowns, participants looked for alternative forms of expression within the current app, moved a conversation to the app that best suited their expression needs, or temporarily switched to other apps to generate and export the content they needed for a conversation. we contribute: 1) a taxonomy of customization options in mobile communication apps that serves as an analytic lens for understanding the role of a customization option in interpersonal communication, as well as a design space for exploring novel opportunities for design; 2) insight into the value of customizations as means for maintaining relationships online; 3) insight into “expression breakdowns” and the transfer of habits of expression between apps; 4) implications for designing new customization opportunities for supporting richer expressions of identity and intimacy within close relationships in ecosystems of communication apps.",846
Orienting to Networked Grief: Situated Perspectives of Communal Mourning on Facebook,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359129,"contemporary american experiences of death and mourning increasingly extend onto social network sites, where friends gather to memorialize the deceased. that ""everyone grieves in their own way'' may be true, but it forecloses important questions about how people evaluate these expressions, their relationship to others who are grieving, and impacts on their own experiences of grief. drawing from mixed-methods research conducted over five years, we describe how individuals position themselves within and evaluate expressions of networked grief. we start by identifying five orientations -- reinforcing, supporting, transferring, objecting, and isolating -- that describe how individuals evaluate actions of grievers, position themselves relative to the network, and act when they encounter grief. we then describe factors and tensions that influence how individuals arrive at these orientations. based on our findings, we argue that the design of social media can be sensitized to diverse needs by adopting a situated perspective within a dynamic post-mortem network. death and its associated grief on snss provide an extreme case in which individuals encounter and make sense of emotional content in networked spaces. snss are optimized for connecting with others and sharing experiences and though they appear dynamic are actually quite brittle in how they encode these contexts and relationships. gathering with others who are also grieving in online spaces can be a key way to receive support while also reinforcing one’s connection with the deceased [23]. however, even as snss facilitate communal experiences of mourning [50], people are variable in how much they can or choose to participate in or even be exposed to the grief of others in these spaces. some may benefit from communal expressions of grief, but for others the individualized nature of grief [51] may result in a desire to limit their interactions with the broadly public spaces afforded by snss. rather than defaulting to the simple truism that “everyone grieves differently,” the analysis we present describes how people judge and navigate the actions of others as they develop their own orientation to instances of networked grief. in so doing, our model gives insight into how networks “happen.” even as individuals make sense of their relationships to others, their actions serve to initiate, shift, calcify, and erode their relationships to these networks [1]. ultimately, individuals do not simply sign in to facebook to express their grief. the networks that happen around individuals as they express their emotions act to construct their grief. orientations describe how individuals negotiate their own needs in relationship to a broader network. public spaces for grief are not simply supportive environments where those who are grieving can gather. nor are they just sites that open people up to new risks. they are dynamic spaces that are best understood from individuals’ perspectives and their place within a network. the diversity of orientations we shared may help to complicate simple or idealized assumptions about the experience and expression of grief in networked settings. people change how they orient to grief and to the expressions of it over time and as context changes. while we have identified five key orienting forms in our data, additional orientations could likely emerge given different contexts — both technological and not. large social network sites like facebook would benefit from directing their efforts on the steps we outlined in our model that highlight points of inflection that give rise to orientations. large-scale data science, focused on identifying markers for the milestones we have outlined through which people orient, could help identify orientations that exist within a specific platform, as well as possible tensions between different orientations. likewise, while designers should explore ways to accommodate specific orientations in their systems, they should also consider how people might pivot rapidly among these. while challenging, designers can shape the orientations that emerge by addressing the factors we have identified here. as first steps, we suggest that designers focus on what expressions of grief an individual encounters (encounter, in our model) and what contextual information is available as an individual evaluates these expressions (situate). this work demonstrates how people come to produce various orientations to grieving networks on facebook. an individual’s orientation can change in relationship to an evolving network of grievers, and is contingent on their understanding of the nature and composition of the network, how it is changing, behavioral norms, and expressions of grief. however, by exploring how people adopt an orientation to an evolving network, our analysis sheds light on broader questions of sociality on snss. the work presented in this paper is thus relevant to innumerable instances in which a person is struck by a post on an sns — whether it be distressing, funny, or bombastic. future work may benefit from examining how the factors we describe in our model function in other social spaces, in reaction to other categories of posts, and in service of other emotions. such research would enrich our understanding of the various orientations that are produced through a process of situating oneself to evolving networks.",847
Crowdsourcing Perceptions of Fair Predictors for Machine Learning: A Recidivism Case Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359130,"the increased reliance on algorithmic decision-making in socially impactful processes has intensified the calls for algorithms that are unbiased and procedurally fair. identifying fair predictors is an essential step in the construction of equitable algorithms, but the lack of ground-truth in fair predictor selection makes this a challenging task. in our study, we recruit 90 crowdworkers to judge the inclusion of various predictors for recidivism. we divide participants across three conditions with varying group composition. our results show that participants were able to make informed decisions on predictor selection. we find that agreement with the majority vote is higher when participants are part of a more diverse group. the presented workflow, which provides a scalable and practical approach to reach a diverse audience, allows researchers to capture participants' perceptions of fairness in private while simultaneously allowing for structured participant discussion. emerging hci research on algorithmic fairness has pointed to the importance of research methods that are scalable [20], practical [55], and able to ensure a diverse sample [60]. this work investigates the feasibility of utilising crowdsourcing for fair predictor assessment in machine learning. our results indicate that our participants were able to make an informed decision using graphs, as indicated by the explicitly verifiable questions and analysed chat logs. we found higher performance following discussion among diverse groups as compared to uniform groups. our study provides a look into the use of crowdworkers in discussions concerning the critical area of algorithmic fairness. it offers a structured and scalable approach, based on interactive (group) conversations led by a bot. future work may expand this work into other areas of algorithmic fairness outside of predictor selection, and offer a more systematic assessment on the effect of group diversity",848
Makers and Quilters: Investigating Opportunities for Improving Gender-Imbalanced Maker Groups,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359131,"recent efforts to diversify participation in stem (science, technology, engineering & math) activities through informal learning environments, such as hackathons and makerspaces, confirm a real desire for inclusion among potential female participants. however, understanding factors that may contribute to longer-term, sustainable diversification of such groups remains a challenge. in this paper, we present the results of a mixed-methods study of two microcosms of making: game development, and quilting. our findings reveal parallel structures within these groups despite being highly skewed towards male or female participation, respectively. our results shed light on attitudes, behaviours, and experiences indicating that similar desires for wider community support among other factors exist in both groups, but these needs are not satisfied in the stem context. we conclude by discussing the implications of our findings as opportunities for rethinking how we design the environments that are meant to support design itself, considering the role of technology in these spaces, and prioritizing nurturing the development of the maker community beyond the maker space. in this work, we investigated crafting spaces as an extension of existing work on maker groups, focusing on female-dominated quilting groups in comparison to the masculine culture of game jams. through fieldwork and thematic analysis as well as questionnaire data on intrinsic motivation, we found that participants’ feelings of autonomy, competence, and relatedness were satisfied in different ways across the quilting group, and that the stem-oriented game jam failed to provide opportunities to engage a more diverse group of people. we offer a number of recommendations to consider how game jams, and by extension, maker groups might be reimagined, boiling down to a shift in focus: instead of focusing on specific goals to achieve, organizers could put their efforts into fostering longer-lasting community ties through satisfaction of needs.",849
Automatically Analyzing Brainstorming Language Behavior with Meeter,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359132,"language both influences and indicates group behavior, and we need tools that let us study the content of what is communicated. while one could annotate these spoken dialogue acts by hand, this is a tedious, not scalable process. we present meeter, a tool for automatically detecting information sharing, shared understanding, word counts, and group activation in spoken interactions. the contribution of our work is two-fold: (1) we validated the tool by showing that the measures computed by meeter align with human-generated labels, and (2) we demonstrated the value of meeter as a research tool by quantifying aspects of group behavior using those measures and deriving novel findings from that. our tool is valuable for researchers conducting group science, as well as those designing groupware systems. in this paper, we presented the meeter tool for automatic detection of language group processes from speech using linguistic and prosody analysis. we showed that with meeter, a number of important group behavior measures, can be detected automatically and that these measures are highly correlated with measurements produced by human annotators. we further validated the tool by studying relationships between group processes detected by meeter and group outcomes: (1) groups that showed higher levels of information sharing and shared understanding were more satisfied; (2) groups that used fewer words were more satisfied; (3) more activated groups as measured through speech prosody, showed higher levels of group performance. our study shows that tools that automatically and accurately quantify group behaviors could enable larger-scale studies and make it possible to conduct group behavior measurements in the wild, and such tools could enable novel automated interventions.",850
Towards Successful Knowledge Integration in Online Collaboration: An Experiment on the Role of Meta-Knowledge,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359133,"successful knowledge integration, that is, systematic synthesis of unshared information, is key to suc-cess, but at the same time a challenging venture for teams with distributed knowledge collaborating online. for example, teams with heterogeneous knowledge often have only vague or even wrong ideas about who knows what. this situation is further complicated if the collaboration partners do not know each other and merely communicate online. previous research has found meta-knowledge, that is, knowledge about one's own and the partner's knowledge areas, to be a promising but not yet sufficient-ly investigated approach to promote knowledge integration. with our experimental study we aimed to address this desideratum of research on the role of meta-knowledge in net-based collaborations. we ""simulated"" a chat-based collaboration between partners with heterogeneous knowledge by assigning specific information to students collaborating in dyads on a hidden profile task. to arrive at the correct joint solution for this task, collaborating partners had to pool their shared, but more importantly their unshared information. we compared two conditions: in the experimental condition meta-knowledge was promoted by providing the collaboration partners with self-presentations of each other's roles, which pointed to their unique fields of knowledge, while participants in the control condition did not receive this information. results suggest a positive impact of the meta-knowledge manipulation on two key factors of collaboration: knowledge integration and construction of a transactive memory system (tms).",851
"""This Place Does What It Was Built For"": Designing Digital Institutions for Participatory Change",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359134,"whether we recognize it or not, the internet is rife with exciting and original institutional forms that are transforming social organization on and offline. governing these internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. the dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, a/b-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. one institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of elinor ostrom, known collectively as the ""ostrom workshop."" a key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a ""constitutional layer"" of institutional design. the institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. we explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur minecraft server governance. examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions. despite the increasing importance of digital institutions, cscw’s strong traditional interests in participatory design and online communities have generated little synthesis. our aim in this work is to appreciate the complexity of digital institution design, while still aiming to ultimately be engaging in it. the participatory tradition in digital institution design, kicked off in large part by kollock and smith [68], has lagged behind other, more convenient paradigms. kraut and resnick’s building successful online communities represents one of the most influential and theoretically-grounded paradigms within the space of digital institution design. while its psychological engineering approach offers a useful slate of design tricks, such approaches have prioritized top-down thinking over designing institutions for substantive participation. as convenient as it is for platforms serving hundreds of millions of users, behavioral engineering design thinking fails to incorporate values fundamental to fair, resilient, and ethical digital institutions. the limitations of the engineering approach have become impossible to ignore since at least 2016: an emphasis on monetized engagement over end-user safety gave tools to outside agents who hijacked the behavioral change and engagement maximization capabilities of online platforms toward malicious ends. the result is online platforms that have lost control over their coupling to broader geo-political forces, and are failing to give users governance responsibilities, or fulfill their rights. the fields of human computer interaction, social computing, and computer-supported cooperative work find their history in the design of interfaces to support individual user experiences, supporting group work, and understanding and designing for technology use in context. dourish [29] and grudin [50] have outlined how ethnographic methods came to be adopted within human-computer interaction in response to the need for understanding the social organization and contexts of technology use in “real world” settings beyond controlled laboratory environments. as these research communities have moved their attention to larger-scale settings, they have often brought the same limited image of the user’s role [7]. existing design processes have excluded individual users from substantive roles in system change, preferring instead to embed them into lower-level roles, and interfaces engineered to nudge behavior to suit design goals. frameworks for analyzing the design of institutions offer an additional step “upwards” and invite comparisons of these organizations and contexts. where an experimental or evaluation perspective might ask which rules users perceive to be fair, or an archival or ethnographic perspective might analyze the unfolding interactions around implementing rules, an institutional design perspective asks what kinds of norms and rules (operational level), what implementation strategies (collective level), and what rule-making processes (constitutional level) are used, how these interact, and what alternatives exist. dourish [30] argued for broadening hci from the interactions between user and screen and orienting to considerations of scale for design engagements. the ostrom workshop’s frameworks go a long way towards participatory design’s concern for the “politics of design” as well as answering dourish’s call for a “design of politics” within hci [30] by considering the design of institutions that are focused on governing a system’s limited resources through participatory and democratic mechanisms. at a time when issues such as the disappearance of application programming interfaces (apis) signal concentration of control in the hands of platform owners (cf. [58]), consideration of participation is of the utmost important. the designers of digital institutions should look to resource management approaches as they confront the limits of their crumbling governance strategies. the ostrom workshop in particular has several successful frameworks for theorizing and classifying the technological, cultural, economic, and political strategies employed by institutions across a variety of contexts and scales. these frameworks make more facets of digital institution design legible to cscw scholars. the engineers, scientists, and managers on major social platforms are engaged in digital institution design by making choices about roles, resources, rights, rules, and governance. however, research and teaching emphasizing resource management and institutional analysis are conspicuously absent from the computer and information science and engineering fields from which platforms’ governing engineers, designers, and managers are recruited. with more general frameworks that permit more ambitious comparisons of more diverse institutions, we get closer to a science of digital institution design that is general enough to avoid the problem of asssuming away the future’s most creative, innovative, and inspiring experiments in digital democracy.",852
The Dynamics of Peer-Produced Political Information During the 2016 U.S. Presidential Campaign,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359135,"wikipedia plays a crucial role for online information seeking and its editors have a remarkable capacity to rapidly revise its content in response to current events. how did the production and consumption of political information on wikipedia mirror the dynamics of the 2016 u.s. presidential campaign? drawing on systems justification theory and methods for measuring the enthusiasm gap among voters, this paper quantitatively analyzes the candidates' biographical and related articles and their editors. information production and consumption patterns match major events over the course of the campaign, but trump-related articles show consistently higher levels of engagement than clinton-related articles. analysis of the editors' participation and backgrounds show analogous shifts in the composition and durability of the collaborations around each candidate. the implications for using wikipedia to monitor political engagement are discussed. wikipedia’s centrality as an online reference provides important context about the supply and demand for information during a political campaign. this analysis demonstrated a significant and sustained enthusiasm gap for creating, editing, and viewing content favoring trump over clinton existed on wikipedia. in almost every metric examined, content related to trump attracted more editors, more revisions, more new articles, larger articles, and more page views than content related to clinton. these differences emerged relatively early in the primaries, were amplified over the course of the campaign, and are not explained by changes in the likelihood of each candidate winning. instead, this enthusiasm gap in political information production and consumption may be an effect of wikipedia editors responding to coverage disparities in the broader media ecosystem rather than partisan agendas. these findings have implications for researchers examining the effects of political communication, candidates and their campaigns understanding political information seeking behavior of large populations, as well as the wikipedia community reflecting on its responsibilities within a complex media ecosystem influencing political outcomes.",853
Implications of Grassroots Sustainable Agriculture Community Values on the Design of Information Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359136,"information system designers embed values into the systems they design, even if unwittingly. however, the values embedded in many information systems clash with values held by many sustainability communities. this research focuses on two grassroots sustainable agriculture communities, which are seeking to develop a food infrastructure that is under their own control, and thereby more resilient to disruptions across the globe. this paper presents a five-year ethnographic study of these two communities, maps out the values of members of these communities, and explores the implications of their values on the information systems that members use and that could be developed to support them in the future. by doing so, we hope to influence the design of future information systems to align more closely with the values of these stakeholders, and through these stakeholders to move toward a food system that supports food security and global sustainability. this paper introduced the values of two permaculture communities that impact their information system design and use. these long-term, resistance, and technology values yielded a set of implications for information system and technology design not often considered by mainstream academic and industry hci. most common-place sociotechnical systems are unsustainable because they are built to meet goals that are at odds with long term sustainability, such as the aggregation of money and power and other short-term goals. we demonstrated how such unsustainable features are also antithetical to the participating communities values and practices. developing information systems based on the values and practices of sustainability communities such as those that participated in this work has the potential to transform the information system landscape to one that can support the design and development of sustainable agriculture, if not to one that is broadly sustainable and equitable. harrison, tatar, and sengers [32] explain that meaning is derived from information and that meaning is dependent on viewpoints, interactions, histories, and local resources to make sense of that information. these communities shared common core values and information from the permaculture movement which lead to an overlap in community-specific long-term, resistance, and technology values. with thousands more permaculture communities in the world, not to mention other grassroots sustainable agriculture communities, these long-term, resistance, and technology values are a relatively common set of values that warrant rigorous exploration and consideration in cscw and hci research. however, because of the potential variance in meanings based on interactions, histories, and local resources, it is important that we do not assume that one permaculture or sustainable agriculture community is the same as the others and that a information system or technology for one community will work for another. action research initiatives such as this one can guide designers toward information system solutions that support the communities they are working with. though they may not be tailored to any other specific community, resulting information systems may provide other communities with better suited technologies than the ones created for a general, tech-enthusiast population. if the technologies we design for specific communities are open for adoption and revision, other communities that derive similar meaning from environmental and social information suddenly have the ability to modify or tailor tools rather than build from scratch or conform to the vastly different values embedded in other tools.",854
Towards Digitization of Collaborative Savings Among Low-Income Groups,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274304,"rotating savings and credit association (rosca) is a mechanism of informal collaborative savings that is widely used across the globe. despite its popularity and prevalence, it is not well-studied from hci and cscw perspectives. the global increase in mobile penetration has created opportunities to serve the unbanked using mobile-based digital financial services (dfs) for greater financial inclusion but there have not been any dfs-based interventions around roscas. in this paper, we report a qualitative study involving 80 individuals to understand the dynamics of roscas and opportunities for their digitization in the pakistani context. we also present a smartphone-based digital rosca platform designed on top of a simulated mobile money system. the platform was designed to be inclusive towards low-literate users. we present qualitative findings of its evaluation with 15 users (3 individual rosca groups). we find that digitization has the potential to support and strengthen traditional roscas by mitigating issues like record-keeping, delayed payments, collection, distribution, and safety of money. it also allows the creation of payment history for individuals that can be used to score their financial credibility. roscas are a popular informal collaborative saving mechanism around the globe. in this research, we present a qualitative study of 80 individuals to understand the dynamics of roscas and identify the opportunities for their digitization. we built a smartphone-based digital rosca application to facilitate the working of roscas, make them more inclusive, and overcome the issues associated with them. the digital rosca application was tested with 15 users (3 individual rosca groups) and our findings reveal that digitization of this collaborative saving practice mitigates the issues like record-keeping, delayed payments, collection, distribution, and safety. in the future, we plan to test the digital rosca application with a larger user-base and for a longer duration. we also plan to replace the simulated mobile money back-end with real-world mobile money systems. currently, our service only facilitates smartphone users. we plan to cater to other modalities such as sms, ussd, ivr in the future, as explained section 8.2. to preserve social capital between organizers and members, the digital rosca application currently does not impose penalties on delayed payments. however, support for various (optional) monetary and non-monetary penalties can be provided in future versions. digital rosca have the potential for encouraging digital payments by extending liquidity farming [40] in two ways, by creating groups with people outside of an individual’s social circle, and by qualifying for credit from a serviceprovider based on digital rosca transaction history. this requires the creation of a combination of social and credit rating mechanisms, which replace social trust with quantified behavior in rosca groups. digital roscas also present opportunities for extending customer engagement beyond simple savings in groups to investments by providing advisory for the investment of unplanned savings, and collaborations with e-commerce platforms for allowing the purchase of durable goods.",855
"""The Most Trustworthy Coin"": How Ideological Tensions Drive Trust in Bitcoin",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359138,"bitcoin is an innovative technological network, a new, non-governmental currency, and a worldwide group of users. in other words, bitcoin is a complex sociotechnical system with a complex set of risks and challenges for anyone using it. we investigated how everyday users of bitcoin develop trust in bitcoin on one of the largest online communities devoted to bitcoin: the reddit.com r/bitcoin forum. using qualitative content analysis, we examined how trust in bitcoin develops based on contributions to this community. on r/bitcoin, trust in bitcoin is driven by a pervasive ideology we call the ""true bitcoiner"" ideology. this ideological viewpoint in centered on the interpretation of bitcoin as functionally ""trustless"" and risk-free. despite widespread evidence of emerging individual and system-level risks with using bitcoin, participants continue to maintain this ideological perspective. this ideology consists of three primary beliefs: viewing bitcoin's technology as more trustworthy than its people; rejecting 'corrupt' social hierarchies related to money; and the importance of accumulating or 'hodling' quantities of bitcoin as a strategy to create an ideal future. we conclude that this ""true bitcoiner"" ideology is maintained despite contradictory evidence in the world because it allows participants to more easily interpret bitcoin and make decisions by reducing perceived risk and uncertainty in the system. the role of this ideology on r/bitcoin demonstrates an expanded conceptualization of how trust is created and socially-mediated in socio-technical contexts. bitcoin is a complex socio-technical system [10] that depends on user trust [2] in order to function properly. by analyzing almost three months of postings on the r/bitcoin subreddit, we described how people use this online community to build and maintain trust in bitcoin. we found that participants have a specific “true bitcoiner” ideology that they promote. this ideology is founded on an interlocking set of beliefs that define bitcoin’s underlying technology as infallible, interpret existing institutions of money and powerful people as corrupt, and allow the collective imagination of an idealized bitcoin future produced by accumulating and “hodling” bitcoin. these beliefs all connect back to the core belief that stems to bitcoin’s intended purpose: a “trustless” system of money. despite ample contradictory interpretations and real-world failings, this belief in the trustless nature of bitcoin is maintained by this ideological perspective. interpreting bitcoin as trustless reduces interpretive complexity, minimizes the recognition of risk, and supports the development of community camaraderie to collectively imagine, and work towards, a new bitcoin future. this ideology’s role in socio-technical building has implications for how people understand and use socio-technical systems broadly. it is difficult to build trust in a complex socio-technical system like bitcoin when most people do not fully understand that system. but it is important to do so, or people won’t use the system. this “true bitcoiner” ideology that has emerged on r/bitcoin gives participants in the subreddit ways to justify trusting the system, and the tensions we identified give the subreddit participants ample opportunity to do so. the role of ideology in other socio-technical contexts has potentially major implications, as our findings have demonstrated, for how people interpret the system, build community around it, and develop ideological beliefs. ideology in the media has contributed to the rise and fall of empires throughout recorded history [58]. as socio-technical places continue to become more ingrained in how people learn and connect with one another, the way ideology influences how people imagine the reality of these systems and their place within them could have far-reaching consequences. what technology people decide to trust could shape the landscape of trust in modern socio-technical life. just like experiences of trust, the nature of modern socio-technical systems is continuous evolution and change. as our findings demonstrate, the role everyday people do in trusting, internalizing, and sharing ideological perspectives on these complex systems has the potential to change the very nature of these systems.",856
StressMon: Scalable Detection of Perceived Stress and Depression Using Passive Sensing of Changes in Work Routines and Group Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359139,"stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. when left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. depression can occur independently of stress. there has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. however, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. we present stressmon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the wifi infrastructure. using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. these features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. to validate stressmon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. our evaluation demonstrated stressmon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01% true positive rate (tpr), an 80.76% true negative rate (tnr), and a 0.97 area under the roc curve (auc) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. in addition, stressmon was able to detect depression at 91.21% tpr, 66.71% tnr, and 0.88 auc using a 15-day window. we end by discussing how stressmon can expand cscw research, especially in areas involving collaborative practices for mental health management. we presented stressmon, a system to detect severe stress and depressive episodes in individuals. stressmon is designed to be a scalable solution that does not require installing specific applications or owning specific devices. using coarse-grained location data collected directly from the wifi infrastructure, we extracted features of individuals’ routine behaviours and features that sufficiently describe an individuals’ physical interaction patterns. these features were used in two different models to detect stress and depression, respectively. we demonstrated, via three different semesterlong user studies involving 108 students at a university campus, that stressmon has an area under the curve (auc) score of 0.97 (96.01% tpr and 80.76% tnr) at detecting stress using 6-days interval, and an auc of 0.88 (91.21% tpr and 66.71% tnr) at detecting depression using 15-day intervals.",857

How Data Scientists Use Computational Notebooks for Real-Time Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359141,"effective collaboration in data science can leverage domain expertise from each team member and thus improve the quality and efficiency of the work. computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. in this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. we first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. the study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. however, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. the synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists. we probed into how synchronous editing in computational notebooks might change the way data scientists collaborate on a predictive modeling task. our survey findings highlight the tools and strategies that data scientists currently used in collaboration practice. based on the design of current synchronous editing features in computational notebooks, our empirical observation reveals that working on the same notebook results in different collaboration styles compared to working on individual notebooks. the key findings suggest that synchronous editing tools improve collaboration by helping data scientists maintain a shared context and improve work efficiency. however, the current real-time collaborative editing features may lead to several problems (e.g., interference with each others’ work, unbalanced contributions). the challenges in using the current real-time collaboration features suggest that we need better collaborative editing features for computational notebooks. we discuss how our results extend prior work on collaborative editing and how the hci community can play a vital role in broadening the understanding of collaborative data science with a human-centered approach. finally, we propose design implications to enhance synchronous editing in computational notebooks and to improve collaboration among data science workers.",859
Challenges and Design Considerations for Multimodal Asynchronous Collaboration in VR,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359142,"studies on collaborative virtual environments (cves) have suggested capture and later replay of multimodal interactions (e.g., speech, body language, and scene manipulations), which we refer to as multimodal recordings, as an effective medium for time-distributed collaborators to discuss and review 3d content in an immersive, expressive, and asynchronous way. however, there exist gaps of empirical knowledge in understanding how this multimodal asynchronous vr collaboration (mavrc) context impacts social behaviors in mediated-communication, workspace awareness in cooperative work, and user requirements for authoring and consuming multimedia recording. this study aims to address these gaps by conceptualizing mavrc as a type of cscw and by understanding the challenges and design considerations of mavrc systems. to this end, we conducted an exploratory need-finding study where participants (n = 15) used an experimental mavrc system to complete a representative spatial task in an asynchronously collaborative setting, involving both consumption and production of multimodal recordings. qualitative analysis of interview and observation data from the study revealed unique, core design challenges of mavrc in: (1) coordinating proxemic behaviors between asynchronous collaborators, (2) providing traceability and change awareness across different versions of 3d scenes, (3) accommodating viewpoint control to maintain workspace awareness, and (4) supporting navigation and editing of multimodal recordings. we discuss design implications, ideate on potential design solutions, and conclude the paper with a set of design recommendations for mavrc systems. in this paper, we investigated asynchronous vr collaboration based on multimodal recording for spatial tasks. using our experimental system, which affords the capture and replay of multiple interaction modalities, we conducted a qualitative, exploratory study where participants consumed and produced recordings to collaborate on interior design. participants displayed social behaviors, such as proxemics and empathy, even when viewing a replayed representation of an asynchronous collaborator. viewpoint management and awareness were critical for coordinating varying perspectives without real-time feedback in spatial vr. while immersion in cves can help build up 3d context in spatial tasks, it may disorient users when switching between different versions of scenes. although interior design is a popular representative spatial task, not all of our results are necessarily transferable to other types of asynchronous tasks in vr. they may vary by spatial scale (e.g., urban planning), number of collaborators (e.g., virtual conferences), and the complexity of the required multimodal interactions. applying our method to different task contexts will help us triangulate and contrast findings, further inspiring future work. we are aware of some limitations of the study. first, our depiction of a versioning mechanism shown in figure 4 is specific to our implementation of the experimental system and cannot be generalized to all possible implementations of mavrc systems. another implementation-specific example is that, as an initial exploration into characterizing mavrc, our system only supported viewing a single recording at a time. future work could investigate the utility of a different implementation that affords viewing multiple recordings or scenes in parallel. second, the choice of interaction modalities are only representative of what is affordable in the current vr infrastructure. for example, given that eye-tracking is beginning to be commonly integrated into the latest vr headsets [41], one might consider replicating our study with an implementation that can capture user gaze as a way to register awareness and attention of the collaborators. third, participants only exchanged a single chain of multimodal recordings. tasks that involve back-and-forth chains of asynchronous messages are costly, but important to study. tracking across a long history of past scene changes is likely more challenging to understand and manage. extending our design implications to augmented reality (ar) may be a promising angle. however, regarding version control issues, reality-virtuality conflicts [88] are more difficult to resolve than virtuality-virtuality conflicts in vr. an ar user’s viewpoint is strictly bounded to their real body, so addressing the time-space navigation problem will be a non-trivial problem. exploring how heterogeneous collaborators (e.g., multiple co-located/distant or synchronous/asynchronous collaborators) might work together in a similarly immersive system could also be challenging but rewarding.",860

Collaborative Data Work Towards a Caring Democracy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359144,"researchers in human-centered computing have surfaced a feminist ethic of care in interaction with technologies, in data collection, and in data work. drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, we consider how democratic caring might be enacted and sustained through collaborative data work. we employ philosopher joan tronto's theory of caring democracy to structure our analysis of a resident-led initiative that uses data to organize and address issues of neglect and abandonment in their neighborhood. adding to the cscw literature on sociotechnical systems of care, we look particularly at tronto's concept of caring democracy where caring needs and the ways in which they are met are an ongoing and inclusive process of assigning and reassigning caring responsibilities, characterized by both equality of voice and freedom from domination. this work develops grounded insight into the practice of democratic caring and how collaborative data work is relevant to this caring practice. we discuss opportunities and challenges for a data-supported caring democracy and address how caring democracy technologies are different from other modern civic technology practices. we conclude with a call to researchers to identify and enact democratic caring experiments in the small. tronto’s concept of a caring democracy, is, even according to tronto, an abstraction. the specifics of contemporary society are absent in tronto’s theory. this is not a shortcoming or critique of tronto's work. it is a recognition of the difference between political philosophy and engaged research with grassroots activism. using tronto’s theory of caring democracy as a methodological lens in our engaged research, we identified potentials for collaborative data work to support ethical qualities of caring democracy. we also observed the great challenge of caring democracy and that as les enacts these moral qualities of a caring democracy through his data work, and engages in caring with he is also always having to negotiate boundaries and limitations of the various aspects of the network he is working within: the personal preferences of different code enforcement officers, different commitments to the neighborhood from different mayoral administrations, and so on. in the participatory design literature, there is a notion of “democratic design experiments in the small” [10]. the idea is that while democracy occurs at the level of the state, it also occurs through direct action, through the activities of publics of varying sizes. the work of democracy, from this perspective, is to engage in ongoing trials of how we might differently configure our lives together, through making and the use of made things. this idea dovetails with les’ ongoing work towards enacting a caring democracy. indeed, while some might see the limitations of les’ work as a deficiency—particularly in this moment where issues and presumed opportunities of scale are so prominent in both popular discourse and the research in human centered computing—we see the scope of les’ work as part of its defining character and value. caring democracy need not be enacted at the level of the state, or for that matter even at the level of the institution. as a democratic design experiment in the small, care can be enacted by a single person in relation to their community through qualities of attentiveness, shared responsibility, competence, responsiveness, and solidarity. if we accept this, then one challenge for human centered computing is to consider how to design at this scale and with these qualities, for the work of democracy, and in particular a caring democracy, in the small.",862
VidLyz: An Interactive Approach to Assist Novice Entrepreneurs in Making Persuasive Campaign Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359145,"videos are essential for successful crowdfunding campaigns. however, without knowledge of the underlying persuasion factors, novice entrepreneurs may find it difficult to optimize their videos for success. this paper presents vidlyz, a novel assistive tool that allows users to explore the implications of audience-engagement persuasion factors in the context of campaign videos through contrasting examples, crowd-sourced subjective ratings, and feedback on engagement factors. vidlyz promotes active thinking about the impact of audience persuasion factors in making an effective campaign video by guiding novice entrepreneurs in planning materials of their videos on their own, with consideration of the product category, the target audience, and audience-product interactions. to evaluate our system, we collected subjective ratings and feedback on persuasion factors for 140 kickstarter campaign videos from 2100 crowd workers and presented them through our prototype vidlyz tool. a user study with 45 novice users and five previous campaign creators found that our tool was useful for understanding the implication and relative importance of the persuasion factors of the campaign videos. the interactive and active thinking elements of vidlyz promoted novice users to make coherent and persuasive pre-production plan (using storyboards) for their proposed campaign videos. a follow-up user study showed that these storyboards had a higher likelihood of getting funded by crowd workers than those with less persuasive pre-production plan. we concluded with design implications to better support novice entrepreneurs. novice entrepreneurs put a lot of effort in making the materials of their crowdfunding campaigns. one of the most complicated things to make can be the campaign video. persuasive campaign videos can increase the probability of success for crowdfunding campaigns significantly. however, making a persuasive video may not be an easy task for novice entrepreneurs. in this paper, we identified the challenges that novice entrepreneurs may face to make their videos persuasive with limited knowledge. we proposed vidlyz, an assistive tool to help novice entrepreneurs understand how persuasion factors can make a campaign video engaging to the audience. the primary design goals and components of vidlyz contribute to the domain of building a persuasive system for the end-user. our evaluation suggests that through an interactive interface and guided active thinking, vidlyz can assist novice entrepreneurs in planning an effective persuasive campaign video.",863
Technological Frames and User Innovation: Exploring Technological Change in Community Moderation Teams,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359146,"management of technological change in organizations is one of the most enduring topics in the literature on computer-supported cooperative work. the successful navigation of technological change is both more challenging and more critical in online communities that are entirely mediated by technology than it is in traditional organizations. this paper presents an analysis of 14 in-depth interviews with moderators of subcommunities of one technological platform (reddit) that added communities on a new technological platform (discord). moderation teams experienced several problems related to moderating content at scale as well as a disconnect between the affordances of discord and their assumptions based on their experiences on reddit. we found that moderation teams used discord's api to create scripts and bots that augmented discord to make the platform work more like tools on reddit. these tools were particularly important in communities struggling with scale. our findings suggest that increasingly widespread end user programming allow users of social computing systems to innovate and deploy solutions to unanticipated design problems by transforming new technological platforms to align with their past expectations. we investigated the challenges of technological change experienced by volunteer moderation teams of online communities that added a new technological platform with different social and technological affordances. while moderators of small discord communities felt their work was manageable with the new platform’s built-in moderation tools, teams from large communities were challenged with content moderation at scale, managing community information, and organizing communication with their community members. we show that teams’ technological frames, drawn from their experience using reddit’s moderation tools, influenced the strategic design and use of a range of user innovations built using discord’s api. these innovations took the form of bots that transformed features of discord in ways that made the platform function like moderation tools available on reddit. we discuss the consequences of technological change in online communities in terms of the organizational and governance systems that are reconstituted when users are given the tools to reconstruct their technological platform in ways that resemble familiar systems of governance. we argue that end user programming toolkits, like discord’s api, can provide online communities with the building blocks to develop the tools to sustain growth and adapt to change. designers can speculate as to how to best support users of a new system. our work shows how, through user innovation driven guided by technological frames, users can build the systems they need through inspiration drawn from the systems they already know.",864
Causal Effects of Brevity on Style and Success in Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359147,"in online communities, where billions of people strive to propagate their messages, understanding how wording affects success is of primary importance. in this work, we are interested in one particularly salient aspect of wording: brevity. what is the causal effect of brevity on message success? what are the linguistic traits of brevity? when is brevity beneficial, and when is it not? whereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success in observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd workers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd workers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. this allows us to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. we find that concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages up to a length reduction of 30--40%. the optimal reduction is on average between 10% and 20%. the observed effect is robust across different subpopulations of raters and is the strongest for raters who visit social media on a daily basis. finally, we discover unique linguistic and content traits of brevity and correlate them with the measured probability of success in order to distinguish effective from ineffective shortening strategies. overall, our findings are important for developing a better understanding of the effect of brevity on the success of messages in online social media. in this work, our goals are threefold: to measure the effects of length constraints on tweet quality, to determine the linguistic traits of brevity, and to find when brevity is beneficial. to address these goals, we designed a large experiment and deployed it on the amazon mechanical turk crowdsourcing platform. our two-stage experimental pipeline first generated valid, shortened versions of original tweets, then measured the quality of the shortened versions compared with the originals. in our experiment, we observed that tweets of an original length of 250 characters can be successfully reduced by up to 30–40% of their original length with no reduction in quality. the optimal range of shortening is consistently reducing between 10% and 20% of the original length.",865

Information Materialities of Citizen Communication in the U.S. Congress,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359149,"in this paper, we use a materiality lens to explore how information and communication technologies condition interaction between citizens and policymakers of the u.s. congress. we work with ethnographic data - six months of observation in washington d.c. and 48 interviews with staff in the house of representatives. customer relation management systems (crms) used by congress are one of numerous technologies expected to enhance responsive communication between citizens and representatives. we find, instead, that these technologies promote the datafication of citizen information that configures and constrains how policymakers engage citizens as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. crms not only mediate communication between citizens and policymakers, they shape the idea of what communication between citizens and policymakers can be and how citizens are viewed in the eyes of policymakers and their staff. thus, we extend our understanding of the ways in which material configurations of communication technologies influence not only how communication acts unfolds, but also how each partner conceives of and engages with the other. this has dramatic implications for the possibilities of digital communication channels to enhance, or uphold, the ideals of a representative democracy. we engage a material lens to evaluate three moments during member-citizen communication where the materiality of the crms relates to the representation of citizen information. these moments are (1) during the input of citizen information, (2) the transformation of that information into data for analysis, and (3) the production of written responses to citizens. we find that the ways in which crms log and manage information about citizen communication creates discursive expectations that prioritize data-collection and customer satisfaction over substantive engagement. in so doing, crms limit the possibility for citizens to be recognized as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. thus, we offer insight into a case where data-driven technologies elicit pathways for perceived communication and citizen engagement, without inspiring true influence to policy decisions. we find that citizens are continuing to lose their ability to civically engage their policymakers as a result of technological intervention.",867
Speedrunning for Charity: How Donations Gather Around a Live Streamed Couch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359150,"games done quick (gdq) is both a week-long video game speedrunning marathon and a successful charity event, raising more than $1.5 million usd in each of its past five events. to understand gdq's success as an online charity event, we conducted 18 semi-structured interviews with gdq speedrunners, attendees, hosts, and online viewers, analyzed past donation data, and conducted 72 hours of in-person participant observations at a live gdq event. we found that central to every gdq event is ""the couch"" which reconstructs the environment of a living room. viewers do not simply donate to support the charity or in response to the technical prowess and ingenuity of speedrunners, but to actively interact with and be part of the couch experience, the ideal social milieu of speedrunning. building upon previously identified motivations of why viewers donate to online live streamers, our work contributes to understanding how collocated gatherings can reinforce and amplify the cultural and social aspects of online subcultures (even heterogeneous ones) to encourage charitable giving. this opens opportunities for design that evoke a visceral level of engagement with charity events similar to that observed at gdq. games done quick has found great success as a charity organization, raising millions of usd for charity twice a year. drawing from participant observations, interviews with key stakeholders, and analyzing donation data, our findings show that viewers of gdq are motivated to donate to support laudable charity goals, celebrate gameplay skill and commentating on speedruns, and socially interact with the live-streamed event. we also identify a significant motivating factor for viewers to donate: the social milieu of the couch. harkening back to its humble origins in living rooms, the couch at gdq acts as a specialized digital hearth wherein participation around the couch is highly sought after by viewers. here, the digital hearth itself becomes a form of entertainment and an opportunity for social engagement that is live streamed. viewers can virtually join the couch by donating and having their donation message read on stream. the rotating cast around the couch brings in different subcommunities of speedrunning, pooling diverse donations that vie for access to the couch. we envision future work will study the inner-workings of the gdq organization itself—its processes, actors, history, and culture—to better understand technology’s role in charitable fundraising and its relationship in brokering charity organizations. the social milieu of the couch is not unique to gdq. other charity live-stream events (e.g., desert bus for hope, gtlive charity stream, project for awesome) all centrally feature a couch on their streams. opportunities exist for designs to support crowdfunding and charity organizations via infrastructures like those built for gdq around their own “couches” to stimulate participation through donation. we hope this work encourages further study into how we may integrate entertainment technologies such as live streaming to foster actions for public good by a diverse, or even niche, set of online consumers.",868
Learn2Earn: Using Mobile Airtime Incentives to Bolster Public Awareness Campaigns,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359151,"in rural parts of the developing world, spreading awareness about critical issues in health, governance, and other topics is challenging and costly. traditional media such as print, radio and tv each have limitations and offer little guarantee that new information is absorbed or retained by the target population. this paper describes learn2earn, a system that leverages mobile payments to bolster public awareness campaigns in rural india. users call an interactive voice response (ivr) system, listen to a brief audio tutorial, and take a multiple-choice quiz to check their understanding. people who pass the quiz receive a mobile top-up (about $0.14) and have the opportunity to earn additional credits by referring others to the system. we describe a pilot deployment of learn2earn in rural india that spread via word-of-mouth to over 15,000 people within seven weeks. usage was concentrated among young men, many of them students. in a mixed-methods study, we draw upon call logs, electronic surveys, qualitative interviews, and other sources of data to suggest that learn2earn could be an effective way to build awareness about important topics. running an awareness campaign in rural, low-resource areas has traditionally been costly, labor intensive, and difficult to evaluate. learn2earn represents a new approach in which funding for the campaign is re-appropriated into direct incentives for beneficiaries. the recent proliferation of mobile phones offers a new opportunity to automatically administer quizzes, transfer payments, track referrals, and monitor the real-time spread of a campaign. the technology underlying learn2earn is simple, scalable, and affordable, and can hypothetically scale to nationwide deployments in a short period of time. in this exploratory study, we sought to validate the feasibility of learn2earn for a pilot campaign in rural india. our findings illustrated some strengths and weaknesses of the approach. learn2earn spread relatively quickly without any centralized communications outside of the initial seed group. participants were able to learn the content and pass the quiz, were enthusiastic in referring others, and conveyed positive stories regarding the potential impact of the campaign on their community. our study also identifies some opportunities for improvement, such as broadening participation beyond a narrow demographic (young men, many of them students) and preventing users from taking the quiz on behalf of others. we are actively refining the system in response to the study’s findings and are further exploring its potential in new and ongoing deployments.",869
The Principles and Limits of Algorithm-in-the-Loop Decision Making,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359152,"the rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an ""algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. this paper contributes to such research in two ways. first, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. second, through a controlled experimental study on amazon mechanical turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. we studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. these results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.",870
The Coerciveness of the Primary Key: Infrastructure Problems in Human Services Work,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359153,"the premise of a primary key is simple enough: every record or row in a table should have some number or string that can uniquely identify it. primary keys are essential for linking data spread across database tables, and for looking up and retrieving data from specific records. yet for an identifier that seems so straightforward and uncontroversial, we find myriad ways that this unassuming bit of infrastructure has an outsized influence in human services work. through case studies of the organizational networks of two nonprofit human services organizations, we find that different stakeholders use variants of identifiers to support work practices that are far more complex and social than the linking of tables or the lookup of data. yet we also find that the low-level technical properties of the primary key are often coercive, forcing end-users to work on the infrastructure's terms-influencing the nature and order of the work, creating new forms of work, and influencing the tenor of the relationships among stakeholders. the technical abstractions of the underlying infrastructure, then, start to become the de facto public policy. we conclude by offering design provocations for better supporting identification across a variety of contexts. information infrastructures are, indeed, performative. the schemas and classification systems that privilege the collection and use of some data over others influence what is possible. but the identifiers and primary keys that enable the linking and accessing of those data are also performative. the technical properties that have been baked into the primary key shape work in often-coercive ways, forcing end-users to operate in the image of the infrastructure and to find ways of working around that infrastructure. in this research, then, we make the following contributions: • elaborate a design space for identifiers, including empirically-observed variants of identifiers along axes of anonymity and uniqueness; proc. acm hum.-comput. interact., vol. 3, no. cscw, article 51. publication date: november 2019. the coerciveness of the primary key 51:23 • present a descriptive account of four classes of sociotechnical work afforded by primary keys and other identifiers that do the work of primary keys; • identify three technical abstractions of the primary key—that it cannot be changed, cannot be empty, and must be unique—the properties of which have forced end-users to work in the image of the infrastructure; • suggest design provocations for better supporting identification across a variety of contexts; and • provide an empirical account of infrastructural abstractions coercively influencing work practice and enacting de facto public policy. the data collected by human services organizations characterize some of society’s most pressing social problems. these data provide accounts of the interdependence of various human challenges; chronicle the successes and failures of potential remedies and solutions; and support data-driven decision-making for individuals, organizations, and larger communities. if the identifiers and primary keys that hold information infrastructures together and that bring information infrastructures together were more supportive of the sociotechnical context of these critical data, we could engender more transformative outcomes for human services organizations, their clients, the communities they work in, the donors who fund them, as well as the policymakers and citizens who have a stake in these organizations delivering effective services.",871
Computing Education for Intercultural Learning: Lessons from the Nairobi Play Project,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359154,"this paper explores computing education as a potential site for intercultural learning and encounter in post-conflict environments. it reports on ethnographic fieldwork from the nairobi play project, a constructionist educational program serving adolescents aged 14-18 in urban and rural multi-ethnic refugee communities in kenya. while the program offers programming and game design instruction, an equal goal is to foster interaction, collaboration, dialogue and understanding across cultural backgrounds. based on fieldwork from two project cycles involving 5 after-school classes of 12-24 students each, we describe key affordances for encounter, important resistances to be managed or overcome, and emergent complications in the execution of such programs. we argue that many important accomplishments of intercultural learning occur through moments of friction, breakdowns, and gaps -- for example, technical challenges that produce sites of shared humour; frictions between intercultural activities and computing activities; acts of disrupting order; and unstructured time that students collaboratively fill in. we also describe significant complications in such programs, including pressures to adopt norms and practices consistent with dominant or majority cultures, and instances of intercultural bonding over artefacts with xenophobic themes. we reflect on the implications of these phenomena for the design of future programs that use computing as a backbone for intercultural learning or diversity and inclusion efforts in cscw, ictd, and allied fields of work. intercultural learning is a challenging project, one made more difficult – but all the more important – in the context of the growing multi-ethnic and refugee communities produced by the experience of geopolitical conflict and displacement in a growing number of locations around the world. whether computer-supported cooperative “work” or “play,” as computing education and professions touch more areas of the world, and as world events contribute to ever-increasing multicultural communities, diversity challenges will only multiply. we find that constructionist computing education, accompanied by good pedagogical support, can be a site for effective intercultural learning and collaboration, but also that numerous challenges and pitfalls remain, many only partially addressable through efforts at better technical and pedagogical practice and design. rather than seeking to overcome or ‘solve’ such difficulties, future efforts in this space should learn to work creatively with and within these limits, approaching the inevitable frictions, breakdowns and gaps that accompany the work of intercultural learning as resources to be drawn on, leveraged, and deployed.",872
A Forensic Qualitative Analysis of Contributions to Wikipedia from Anonymity Seeking Users,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359155,"by choice or by necessity, some contributors to commons-based peer production sites use privacy-protecting services to remain anonymous. as anonymity seekers, users of the tor network have been cast both as ill-intentioned vandals and as vulnerable populations concerned with their privacy. in this study, we use a dataset drawn from a corpus of tor edits to wikipedia to uncover the character of tor users' contributions. we build in-depth narrative descriptions of tor users' actions and conduct a thematic analysis that places their editing activity into seven broad groups. we find that although their use of a privacy-protecting service marks them as unusual within wikipedia, the character of many tor users' contributions is in line with the expectations and norms of wikipedia. however, our themes point to several important places where lack of trust promotes disorder, and to contributions where risks to contributors, service providers, and communities are unaligned. building on a number of existing methodologically approaches, we propose a new qualitative methodology—forensic qualitative analysis—that extends existing methods to provide us with an understanding of the behavior and intent of people who cannot or will not participate in more direct research techniques. using this technique, we contribute to our understanding of a very difficult-to-observe population. we construct our field site around the contributions of individuals protecting their privacy through tor and the responses of the community to these contributions. building on prior work that examined the degree to which tor-based contributors act in good faith and make contributions that are non-damaging, we use our new methodology to establish a series of themes. we found that tor-based contributors make quotidian, good-faith, non-damaging contributions to building the encyclopedia. they use policies to uphold quality and use platform affordances to collaborate with others with varying degrees of success. we also found that they violate policies in ways that damage the quality of the resource: they vandalize, harass, and participate in edit wars. although anonymity seemed incidental or important in many of the types of contributions we examined, it appeared to play a critical in making the contributions possible in others. we saw examples of activists challenging power structures who may have had good reasons for seeking to protect their privacy. resources which seek to reflect all the world’s knowledge may have good reason to embrace those who would champion perspectives outside the status quo that might not be heard in the absence of strong anonymity protection. with the deeper look afforded by forensic qualitative analysis, our results suggest that anonymity seekers may add additional value to peer production projects through their work on controversial topics as well as through their ability to challenge prevailing power structures. our work also suggests that the risks to communities of allowing anonymous contributions may vary enormously. indeed, different contributors and communities may value particular contributions differently when weighing them against these risks. we saw many examples of both productive and unproductive engagement through tor and believe, from the context that were able to gather, that at least some of both types of edits would never had occurred if tor were blocked completely. myagmar et al. [36] suggest four alternatives for managing risk: accept, transfer, remove, and mitigate. wikipedia initially accepted participation from tor before following a strategy of removal with progressively effective techniques. new technology such as automated filtering systems and damage detection capabilities may allow communities to pursue a mitigation strategy in the future. we believe that our findings provide evidence in support of mitigation-based approaches that attempt to maximize value while minimizing damage. we also believe our work can provide some insight into the nuanced ways that value may flow into peer production communities from anonymity seeking users that we hope will inform these approaches in the future.",873
Restoration Work: Responding to Everyday Challenges of HIV Outreach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359156,"there has been a growing commitment across the fields of computer-supported cooperative work (cscw) and human-computer interaction for development (hci4d) towards investigating the design and deployment of technologies in the context of complex healthcare ecologies. we present a qualitative inquiry of one such context, as we examine the outreach practices and everyday challenges of workers at a community-based organization in gujarat (india) that works with people living with the human immuno-deficiency virus(plhiv). drawing on yosso's framework of community cultural wealth-apt for such intersectional settings-and the lens of articulation work, we describe how the workers at vikas build and strengthen varied forms of capital to restore ""old normals,"" or what life was like for their plhiv clients prior to diagnoses. finally, we propose that attention to this nature of restoration work, and the workers' engagement with diverse forms of community cultural wealth, allows us to reflect on how technologies might (or might not) be designed to impact social and affective aspects of health. we conducted a field study of the everyday practices and challenges of hiv outreach workers employed by vikas, a community-based organization in surat, gujarat (india). we investigated the intersectional realities of the contexts they operate in, as they aim to restore “old normals” or life before diagnosis for plhiv. by focusing on the articulation work performed by these workers, we learned that they not only aspire to address health conditions, but also attempt to facilitate restoration of various forms of capital of their hiv-positive clients. we drew attention to the spaces where technology might be of assistance to them (or not), through an examination of the ways in which they engage diverse forms of community cultural wealth [125]. finally, we reflected on how a focus on restoration work might advance cscw, hci, and hci4d research.",874
Moderation Challenges in Voice-based Online Communities on Discord,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359157,"online community moderators are on the front lines of combating problems like hate speech and harassment, but new modes of interaction can introduce unexpected challenges. in this paper, we consider moderation practices and challenges in the context of real-time, voice-based communication through 25 in-depth interviews with moderators on discord. our findings suggest that the affordances of voice-based online communities change what it means to moderate content and interactions. not only are there new ways to break rules that moderators of text-based communities find unfamiliar, such as disruptive noise and voice raiding, but acquiring evidence of rule-breaking behaviors is also more difficult due to the ephemerality of real-time voice. while moderators have developed new moderation strategies, these strategies are limited and often based on hearsay and first impressions, resulting in problems ranging from unsuccessful moderation to false accusations. based on these findings, we discuss how voice communication complicates current understandings and assumptions about moderation, and outline ways that platform designers and administrators can design technology to facilitate moderation. while moderation is commonplace in online communities where moderators can remove, edit, and annotate content, change in technology can break down our assumptions and challenge our understandings of moderation by making these actions invalid. this study, through the lens of voicebased communities, examined new rules and new ways to break them through voice communication, and moderators’ challenges without the tools that they used to take for granted. we found that not only did the moderators have a hard time enforcing the rules, proving that a rule violation even happened was also a challenge for them. while recording may be a desirable solution, our findings pointed out that voice-only recording was not enough because moderators were not able to link members’ unique voice to their identities. furthermore, the vague platform policies on recording may subject the volunteer moderators to legal ramifications. we argue that platform designers and administrators should carefully consider the impact of technological infrastructure on communities that they host, and develop technology and policies that provide moderators ample support and protect them from unexpected harm caused by the technology.",875
Dissonance Between Human and Machine Understanding,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359158,"complex machine learning models are deployed in several critical domains including healthcare and autonomous vehicles nowadays, albeit as functional blackboxes. consequently, there has been a recent surge in interpreting decisions of such complex models in order to explain their actions to humans. models which correspond to human interpretation of a task are more desirable in certain contexts and can help attribute liability, build trust, expose biases and in turn build better models. it is therefore crucial to understand how and which models conform to human understanding of tasks. in this paper we present a large-scale crowdsourcing study that reveals and quantifies the dissonance between human and machine understanding, through the lens of an image classification task. in particular, we seek to answer the following questions: which (well performing) complex ml models are closer to humans in their use of features to make accurate predictions? how does task difficulty affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans? are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image recognition more accurate? our findings have important implications on human-machine collaboration, considering that a long term goal in the field of artificial intelligence is to make machines capable of learning and reasoning like humans. in this paper, we focus on juxtaposing human understanding in an image recognition task with that of machines in two central scenarios of human decision making – selection of discriminative segments in an image and object recognition. we conducted a large-scale crowd sourcing study entailing 7,000 hits with an aim to further the understanding of dissonance between humans and machines in the image classification task. to this end, we proposed novel metrics to measure the dissonance between humans and 3 state-of-the-art neural network models (inception, resnet, vgg). our findings suggest that human perception of feature importance (i.e., the selection of discriminative segments in task-1) does not consistently result in better human image recognition (in task-2) in comparison to that by the neural network models considered in this work. we found that the models that are close to human understanding also generalise better. our experimental evidence shows that humans are not always able to effectively exploit the use of context towards determining good features (i.e., discriminative segments in images). we also found that image difficulty is directly correlated with the effort in recognising objects irrespective of human or machine selected features. finally, we release our entire dataset consisting of the two-stage crowd sourced tasks, complete with annotations from crowd workers for evaluation of image classification models. our experiments in this paper shed light on the value that such a dataset and task design can bring to the cscw and hci community in furthering the understanding of human-machine dissonance. for example we unearth the fact that over-parametrized models like vgg tend to be more robust even if they are not the best performing models in case of easy images. we resonate that building more human-like machines can result in their seamless integration into our everyday lives, through interactions including collaboration and cooperation. in our future work we will delve into investigating the dissonance between humans and machines (i) when they both make the same error (‘are machines wrong for the right reasons?’) which is key in critical domains like health and defence and (ii) in other tasks such as visual question answering, machine translation, document retrieval etc. we also aim to investigate effects of a closed domain assumption for image recognition and other classification tasks where the set of classes/labels are known to the assessor.",876
Infrastructuring Food Democracy: The Formation of a Local Food Hub in the Context of Socio-Economic Deprivation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359159,"this paper discusses what infrastructuring in participatory design can contribute to processes of food system democratisation. it presents almost two years of engagement with a community-based organisation in a socio-economically deprived neighbourhood in england with the aim of developing a local food hub. it documents how the collaborative work shifted from setting up an infrastructure to ongoing infrastructuring of an enabling environment to grow and sustain social innovation. while the former focused on a technological platform and a business to deliver inclusivity, customer experience, and marketing, the latter focuses on building lasting relationships on three levels: strengthening ties within the community-based organisation, offering social spaces to connect with the local community, and with other organisations by forming coalitions with mutual benefits. we contribute three design opportunities: first, in order to infrastructure the formation of publics around food initiatives, we need to design for relationship building. second, we point to design implications for ethical aspirations, participation, and system transformation towards a food democracy. finally, we reflect on the sustainability of infrastructuring and the role of designers to work towards independent infrastructures. through a long-term and open-ended collaboration with a community centre, our ongoing work wants to infrastructure a civic food network in a socio-economically deprived community. after two years of work, we have documented a negotiation between researchers and partner organisations to shift the collaboration from setting up an infrastructure to infrastructuring an enabling environment for socio-material processes to grow and maintain the food hub. understanding the food hub not just as an online platform and a pick-up point, but as a socio-material assemblage, a thing, helped shaping the kind of action we engaged in. from initially focusing on lowering the barriers by improving access, providing a smooth customer experience and delivering professional marketing, we shifted to building new relationships and strengthening existing ties. this includes collaborating closer within an organisation that has a wide range of services and offers, offering social spaces for the community to connect over food, and developing mutually beneficial activities with other organisations, all contributing to forming publics around the shared matter of care, the food hub. furthermore, the infrastructuring lens is useful to address some of the challenges cfns face in their effort to work towards food democracy. by following a participatory action research approach that focuses on building relationships and supporting positive practices, we aim at responding to the problems of ethical consumerism. equally, building relationships, as slow and laborious as it can be, helps to retain a sensitivity to the complexity of participants’ lives. furthermore, while this food hub remains small so far, it is a replication and adaptation of other food hubs, and might help replications and adaptations elsewhere, all moving the overall idea of food democracy along. critical for the long-term sustainability of the food hub, and possibly similar forms of social innovation, is to recognise the fragility of this thing in its early stages, depending on key individuals to remain alive. while the designer and researcher can be an important driver, it is also important to engage in a long-term transition, in which a persistent infrastructure is created and maintained that is owned and directed by local actors. for our future work or other food democracy infrastructuring work in socio-economically deprived areas, we point to the importance of both infrastructure work (as in technical systems and operational processes) and social processes on the ground to start a civic food network. ideally, both should happen in parallel and intertwined, but due to issues of complexity and resources this might not always be possible. in our case, the infrastructure came first, given the drive from suppliers and the community centre. having an actual infrastructure in place can also serve as a starting point for discussions and help with the community engagement. in other cases, this might happen the other way around. for community engagement to be successful, we recommend a sensitive and multi-faceted approach that offers many different ways for people to engage. given how context-specific the form cfns take can be, there cannot be one approach to it. critically, whatever activities might be developed, they should be co-designed with the community from the start. concluding, we believe that infrastructuring can be a fruitful approach to go about working towards food democracy. in turn, we can learn from food democracy to develop a sensitivity to the complex entanglement of ethical aspirations, challenges to participation, and opportunities for system change.",877
An Empirical Study of How Socio-Spatial Formations are Influenced by Interior Elements and Displays in an Office Context,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359160,"the design of a workplace can have a profound impact on the effectiveness of the workforce utilizing the space. when considering dynamic social activities in the flow of work, the constraints of the static elements of the interior reveals the adaptive behaviour of the occupants in trying to accommodate these constraints while performing their daily tasks. to better understand how workplace design shapes social interactions, we ran an empirical study in an office context over a two week period. we collected video from 24 cameras in a dozen space configurations totaling 1,920 hours of recorded activities. we utilized computer vision techniques, to produce skeletonized representations of the occupants, to assist in the annotation and data analysis process. we present our findings of socio-spatial formation patterns and the effects of furniture and interior elements on the observed behaviour of collaborators for both computer-supported work and for unmediated social interaction. combining the observations with an interview of the occupants' reflections, we discuss dynamics of socio-spatial formations and how this knowledge can support social interactions in the domain of space design systems and interactive interiors. this an exploratory study to investigate the influence of spatial characteristics on socio-spatial formations. we captured a rich array of social arrangements exhibited in a office environment for two weeks with corresponding occupants’ space perceptions. we analyzed collected data using skeletonographer, that we implemented to generate skeletonized representations, and to play back and annotate skeleton data. our findings revealed that desk sizes, desk configuration, walls, partitions, and sitting and standing status contribute to different preferred socio-spatial formations during unmediated discussions, while the type and ownership of displays have more significant influence during computer-mediated social interactions. we also found that socio-spatial formations change over time to maintain ergonomic and social comfort in long-term interactions. based on these findings, we propose that future office space designers could plan desired socio-spatial formations at a given space while arranging interior elements to maximize social comfort. we also suggest that this knowledge can inform opportunities for space planning and analysis tools as well as interactive furniture in the future.",878
Privacy Perceptions and Designs of Bystanders in Smart Homes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359161,"as the internet of things (iot) devices make their ways into people's homes, traditional dwellings are turning into smart homes. while prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. we conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. we identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). we highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. we discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes. prior literature in smart home privacy has focused on end-users, leaving other potential stakeholders, such as bystanders, understudied. in this study, we focus on smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners/users of these devices but can potentially be involved in the use of such devices. we aim to understand bystanders’ privacy perceptions in various contexts and their desired ways to mitigate their privacy concerns. through six focus groups with 18 participants, our study results in a number of contextual factors that can potentially influence bystanders’ privacy perceptions of smart homes. in addition, we also identify a set of design factors that the bystanders consider in their desirable privacy mechanisms to address their concerns. these factors can further be categorized into two types, i.e., cooperative mechanisms and bystander-centric mechanisms. our research highlights bystanders’ needs for privacy and some means of controls, the tension between smart homeowners/users and bystanders, as well as how cooperative mechanisms can be used to better support and balance the needs of both groups. we propose several concrete design suggestions based on our results, i.e., having both owners/user-oriented apps and bystander-oriented apps in smart home platforms.",879
Circadian Rhythms and Physiological Synchrony: Evidence of the Impact of Diversity on Small Group Creativity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359162,"circadian rhythms determine daily sleep cycles, mood, and cognition. depending on an individual's circadian preference, or chronotype (i.e.,""early birds"" and ""night owls""), the rhythms shift earlier or later in the day. early birds experience circadian arousal peaks earlier in the morning than night owls. prior work has shown that individuals are more effective at analytic tasks during their peak arousal times but are more creative during their off-peak times. we investigate if these findings hold true for small groups. we find that time of day and a group's majority chronotype impact performance on analytic and creative tasks. physiological synchrony among group members positively predicts group satisfaction. specifically, homogeneous groups perform worse on all tasks regardless of time of day, but they achieve greater physiological synchrony and feel more satisfied as a group. based on these findings, we present and advocate for a temporal dimension of group diversity.",880
Hateful People or Hateful Bots?: Detection and Characterization of Bots Spreading Religious Hatred in Arabic Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359163,"arabic twitter space is crawling with bots that fuel political feuds, spread misinformation, and proliferate sectarian rhetoric. while efforts have long existed to analyze and detect english bots, arabic bot detection and characterization remains largely understudied. in this work, we contribute new insights into the role of bots in spreading religious hatred on arabic twitter and introduce a novel regression model that can accurately identify arabic language bots. our assessment shows that existing tools that are highly accurate in detecting english bots don't perform as well on arabic bots. we identify the possible reasons for this poor performance, perform a thorough analysis of linguistic, content, behavioral and network features, and report on the most informative features that distinguish arabic bots from humans as well as the differences between arabic and english bots. our results mark an important step toward understanding the behavior of malicious bots on arabic twitter and pave the way for a more effective arabic bot detection tools. in this paper, we have investigated the role of bots in spreading hateful messages on arabic twitter. we found that bots were responsible for 11% of hateful tweets in the hate speech dataset. we further showed that english-trained bot detection models deliver a moderate performance in detecting arabic bots. therefore, we developed a more accurate bot detection model trained on various sets of features extracted from 86,346 tweets disseminated by 450 manually-labeled accounts. finally, we presented a thorough analysis of characteristics and behaviors that distinguish arabic bots from english bots and from humans in general. our results facilitate future arabic bot detection research in contexts beyond spread of religious hate.",881
Efficient Elicitation Approaches to Estimate Collective Crowd Answers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359164,"when crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. in this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. we investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single ""best"" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. this resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). by analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ml training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions. this paper demonstrates that, when crowdsourcing the annotation of ambiguous data, we can reduce the cost of collecting reliable collective answer distributions by eliciting richer answers from each worker. we investigated answer elicitation approaches that vary along two dimensions: 1) annotation granularity and 2) the estimation perspective. our results show that the choice of elicitation interface matters, and that the best (most efficient) solution is neither the fastest, nor the most potentially-accurate. instead, we found that the best efficiency can be achieved using an intermediate-granularity approach that asks workers to select multiple labels that they estimate a group of other workers would choose. by analyzing when more fine-grained annotations are less accurate, we found that workers showed a tendency to estimate more heavily-skewed distributions when annotating weights than were actually observed in our ground truth data. while approaches that elicit fine-grained annotations did not result in the best performance when estimating collective answer distributions in our experiments, our work suggests that finding better ways to guide workers to estimate answer distributions by leveraging more fine-grained annotations is a promising future research direction.",882
"""When you can do it, why can't I?"": Racial and Socioeconomic Differences in Family Technology Use and Non-Use",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359165,"there is racial diversity as well as economic inequality in the united states (u.s.). to gain a nuanced understanding of how households from different socio economic and racial backgrounds integrate technology into their lives, we conducted a diary study with 22 parents who were asian indian (the fastest-growing immigrant population in u.s.) and 18 who were white american (the largest racial group in u.s.) parents from the working and middle classes. the participants logged in-situ instances of using smart phones and speaker use by, with, and around children for 8 weeks, and were interviewed once every four weeks (two times in total). our findings reveal differences and similarities in parents' attitudes and practices of using or not using these devices around and with children, in parental restrictions of children's use of technology, and children's daily use patterns. the paper concludes with a discussions of the implications of our findings and suggestions for future design improvements in smart phones and speakers. in this paper, we present the findings from a diary study that extended over a period of eight weeks and involved 40 participants of different races (white and asian indian) and sess (workingand middle-class). during this time, the participants logged daily in-situ instances of smart phone and speaker use by, with, and around children, and they were interviewed twice (once every four weeks). our findings reveal differences between these groups in terms of technology (smart phone and speaker) use and practices in family settings, parental mediation, and parents’ non-use practices in the presence of children. our study indicates that the conversational capabilities of smart speakers impact children’s use, and the parent’s perception of their children’s use, of these device. furthermore, we found a need to improve the behavior of conversational devices in response to the rude or unacceptable behavior exhibited by children in their current use of them and a need to incorporate features that support the learning activities of children in the home setting. finally, as families’ (non-)use of smart phones and speakers is highly variable (e.g., dependent on structural realities or family values) and contextual, we propose future designs that would incorporate a balance of user- and device-centered design principles to account for context.",883
Live Streaming as Co-Performance: Dynamics between Center and Periphery in Theatrical Engagement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359166,"live streaming is a highly participatory form of performance, involving various types of audience participation such as liking, commenting, and gifting. but how do streamers and audiences collaborate to deliver live streaming performances? we approach this question through an interview study with 30 spectators and eight streamers in china. drawing from theatrical engagement research, we use the cogitative spatial concept of center-peripheral attention of the audience to analyze the complex interplay between streamers and spectators, where the former occupy the center and the latter the periphery. we then discuss the orchestration of the center and the periphery, where streamers and spectators coordinate their respective performances, as well as the interaction between the center and the periphery, where the center-periphery distinction blurs. based on these findings, we discuss co-performance as a theatrical metaphor for understanding live streaming and audience engagement. in this paper, we reported the phenomenon of co-performance in china’s live streaming sites. we analyzed co-performance through the lens of theatrical engagement, with a focus on the center-periphery duality. we found such duality to be a useful lens to analyze individuals’ live streaming channels because it acknowledges the intentionality and agency of streamers in deliberately managing their content and their spectators in order to deliver engaging performances, as well as the dynamic and scarce nature of audience attention. audience participation contains an enormous potential to transform the power asymmetry between the streamers and the audience, but any analysis of live streaming should not overlook the fact that (most) live streaming platforms are for-profit and streamers must play the game of commercialization in order to sustain their content production. more research should be done in the future to understand: how the centerperiphery structure might be layered? what other theatrical metaphors could apply to live streaming, and in what way? how the center-periphery duality intersects with the particular cultural contexts of live streaming?",884
"""I Think You'll Like It"": Modelling the Online Purchase Behavior in Social E-commerce",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359167,"understanding the roles of social factors in online purchase behavior has been a long standing research problem. the recently emerging social e-commerce platforms leverage the stimulated word-of-mouth effect to promote the sales of items, which offers a peek into the complex interplay between the social influence and online purchasing behavior. in this paper, we investigate this problem on a full-scale purchase behavior dataset from one of the leading social e-commerce platforms, beidian. specifically, we conduct a comparison study between the social e-commerce and conventional e-commerce that are both integrated in beidian to examine how social factors affect user's purchase behavior. we reveal that social e-commerce leads to a 3.09~10.37 times higher purchase conversion rate compared with the conventional settings, which indicates users make purchase with significantly fewer item explorations. then, we propose and validate four primary mechanisms that contribute to the efficient purchase conversion: better matching, social enrichment, social proof and price sensitivity. moreover, we identify several behavioral indicators that are able to measure the effect of these mechanisms, based on which we design an accurate predictive model (auc=0.7738) for user's purchase decision. these results combine to shed light on how to understand and model the purchase behavior in social e-commerce. the recently emerging social e-commerce provides a unique opportunity to understand how social influences affect online purchase decisions. this work conducts a comparison study between the purchase behaviors in social and conventional e-commerce scenarios. we reveal that the purchase conversion rate in social scenario is 3.09∼10.37 higher than conventional scenario. furthermore, we propose and validate four primary mechanism behind the efficient purchase conversion: better matching, social enrichment, social proof and price sensitivity. we demonstrate that behavioral indicators for the effect of these mechanisms can be extracted from user behavioral data, which facilitates the design of an accurate purchase prediction model. these results provide a novel angle to integrate the social features into the various forms of e-commerce platforms.",885
Higher Education Check-Ins: Exploring the User Experience of Hybrid Location Sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359168,"a large body of literature is dedicated to understanding people's check-in behavior when they use location sharing services to pair their location with a venue, e.g., a restaurant, a park, etc. check-in behavior in higher education settings, e.g., where students and instructors have academic purposes for check-ins, is under-studied. in this work, we explore how university students apply two different mechanisms, i.e., automatic and manual location-sharing services, to conduct check-ins for an academic purpose (i.e., students sharing their class attendance with their instructor). more specifically, a bluetooth low energy beacon-based technology is applied to enable automatic class check-ins. we conducted two field trials with a total of 141 university students. our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the use of auto and manual check-ins. feedback from the student participants suggested that future higher education check-in systems may need to consider the integration of check-ins for a variety of purposes. check-ins are extensively studied on social networks and limited work was conducted in the context of classroom check-ins in higher education settings. we designed and developed a check-in system with two mechanisms enabled and conducted two rounds of field trials with 141 university students. our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the usage of auto check-ins (ble beacon-based) and manual check-ins, and the use of manual check-ins promoted the adoption of auto check-ins. the findings also revealed unexpected barriers of adopting ble beacon-based location sensing. in addition, we identified the needs and potential issues of integrating check-ins with different purposes. our findings provide design implications for future check-in systems within and beyond the higher education context.",886
Cross-Cultural Differences in the Use of Online Mental Health Support Forums,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359169,"online mental health forums facilitate supportive relationships between peers that transcend national and cultural boundaries. while past work in medical anthropology indicates a central role of cultural identity in how individuals frame their mental well-being and distress, little research has been done to investigate the role of culture in seeking and providing mental health support on online forums. using data from two mental health forums, we analyze cross-cultural differences in mental health expression between people from different countries. we characterize these differences along three dimensions--identity, language use, and support behavior. through comparing usage of the platform by individuals from three asian countries with their counterparts from primarily western countries, we find that individuals from these less-represented countries mention their own country more often when expressing distress, use fewer clinical language terms, and are more likely to provide support to people from the same country as them, as expected from past work on mental health in these countries. contrary to past work, however, we find that the use of clinical mental health language is not affected over time by interacting with others in an international forum. while these findings are useful for understanding the role of culture in mental health support, they also have practical design implications for online forums. we find that the three dimensions of cultural differences we analyze are correlated with receiving effective support, and make design recommendations that can improve quality of support for the people in the minority on these forums. in this work, we show that there are cultural differences with regards to how people use online mental health support forums, that these differences extend to two different online mental health support forums, and that these differences matter with regards to how people from minority countries find support that successfully makes them feel better. even with the norm of anonymity on these forums, we find that people still incorporate aspects of their cultural identity into how they use the forum, including mentioning their country of origin, using lower rates of clinical language, and supporting people from their country of origin. we also find that these factors, particularly the cultural homophily of a thread, are strongly related to whether the conversation will make the original poster feel better by the end of the conversation. overall, these differences show the importance of considering culture, with a specific focus on cultural differences among users from minority groups, when designing inclusive online mental health spaces.",887

Including the Voice of Care Recipients in Community Health Feedback Loops in Rural Kenya,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359173,"community health programs in low-resource settings (like rural kenya) aim to provide essential health services to vulnerable populations. however, to date, there has been limited research that explores the design of mechanisms that enable care recipients to provide feedback regarding their satisfaction with the services they receive. such feedback has the potential to increase the motivation of community health workers (chws), enhance training procedures, detect fraudulent behavior, and inform key performance indicators for health programs. our paper explores the design and deployment of a ussd-based system that allows anyone who possesses a basic mobile phone to provide feedback regarding the health services and quality of care they received from a chw or during a hospital visit. our system was designed through iterative fieldwork in rural kenya that engaged with multiple stakeholder groups, including care recipients, chws, and high-level decision makers. after designing and testing the system, we deployed it for seven weeks in siaya, kenya, collecting both quantitative system usage data and qualitative data from six focus groups with 42 participants. findings from our deployment show that 168 care recipients engaged with the system, submitting 495 reports via ussd. we discuss the broader factors impacting deployment, including the feasibility of ussd, actionability of feedback, scalability, and sustainability. taken together, our findings suggest that ussd is a promising approach for enabling care recipients to submit feedback in a way that balances privacy, equity, and sustainability. this paper explored the design and deployment of a ussd system that enables care recipients to provide feedback about the health services they receive. our design approach highlighted the importance of incorporating the views of multiple stakeholder groups. quantitative and qualitative data from our seven week deployment showed that 168 care recipients engaged with the system and submitted 495 reports via ussd, suggesting that ussd is a viable mechanism for a beneficiary feedback system. we also discussed a range of sociotechnical challenges that arose during our study as we explored the feasibility, equity, privacy, and sustainability of using such a system to provide vulnerable populations with a voice in their own community health programs.",891
Reliability and Inter-rater Reliability in Qualitative Research: Norms and Guidelines for CSCW and HCI Practice,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359174,"what does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? what about when writing an auto-ethnography? when is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (irr)? reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. for researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (cscw) and human-computer interaction (hci), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. in this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. we first investigate and describe local norms in the cscw and hci literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: ""should i calculate irr?"" drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of cscw and hci papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, irr is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. we reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using irr as a central example of a form of agreement. the guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new cscw and hci scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research. qualitative research is a rich and powerful way to understand the world around us. yet, we have demonstrated that in cscw and hci, there is little consensus about how to approach reliability in qualitative research. as a result, authors often struggle to communicate methodological choices with confidence and reviewers may communicate confusing expectations. as researchers, we might expect that epistemological stances dictate methodological choices; however, in practice, other forces like perceived norms and reviewer variance may play a role. our descriptive analysis of recent papers finds that most qualitative cscw and hci papers code data as part of their research process and most provide some description of the method they use to do so. far fewer report the number of coders involved in the process and even fewer use irr. justifications for these choices are sparse. we argue that diverse epistemological standpoints in cscw and hci support these diverse uses, but that the community could be clearer about communicating the rationale for methodological choices. further, there is variability in how terms and concepts are used, and although implemented in similar ways, they can be used differently and toward different ends. it is precisely these differences that necessitate thorough descriptions of methods and analytical process. through our analysis and discussion, we examine a wide range of research cases, more experiences and situations than perhaps any one researcher is likely to have encountered in their own practice. finally, we discuss considerations for best practices in writing methods and provide a set of recommendations for when researchers should seek agreement in qualitative research and when it is not needed, or even potentially harmful. in sum: there is no one correct way to approach reliability in qualitative research. different epistemologies invite different frames; we hope that this work serves as a generative starting point for researchers to reflect on their epistemological goals and how they produce knowledge.",892
'Routine Infrastructuring' as 'Building Everyday Resilience with Technology': When Disruption Becomes Ordinary,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359175,"getting a divorce. being diagnosed with a disease. going through a relationship breakup. living through a natural disaster. all of these events are often life disrupting and debilitating. while some disruptive events are short-lived, some can be a routine part of everyday life. this leads to the question of how people who experience prolonged disruption in their lives build resilience---that is, how do they manage and overcome such events? to explore this question, this paper utilizes a case study approach to explore the use, creation, and re-appropriation of technology across three prolonged disruptions-the second gulf war in iraq, veteran transitions, and the coming out experiences of lgbtq-identifying people. using a conceptual frame that brings together routine dynamics and infrastructuring, we find that engaging in routine infrastructuring practices generated resilience in people's daily lives---a phenomenon we dub 'routine infrastructuring' as 'building everyday resilience with technology.' we then theorize properties of infrastructure and infrastructuring practice that enable resiliency, and conclude with how infrastructuring is a form of care work that is oriented towards individuals, communities, and society. whereas we have, in this study, started to more systematically uncover how technology helps people build resilience when experiencing prolonged disruptions to their daily lives, there is still a lot of work to be done in an effort of more deeply and broadly understanding and explicating the relationship between technology and resilience. thus far, this paper has explored ways in which marginalized populations and those experiencing prolonged disruption benefit from routine infrastructuring. however, as cscw and chi scholars, we are engaged in a community who is focusing more and more on the marginalized, who are by definition already vulnerable in myriad ways. importantly, infrastructures—in this case, socio-technical systems—can serve to further marginalize people, as they are designed by people with certain values and perspectives. it is crucial, then, that we consider the moral and ethical implications of the invisible work people do when infrastructuring, as these infrastructures become embedded in the routine lives of those who use them. to frame this conversation, we draw on scholarship from feminist and gender studies which seeks to explicate the interrelationship between technology use and design, and its societal implications [4, 5, 20]. specifically, scholars are beginning to draw on the concept of care work [6, 14, 74] when thinking about the moral and ethical invisibility of technology. care work has traditionally been used to think about the moral and ethical implications of the invisible work people do to make systems, such as families, maintain momentum in their everyday lives [14, 74]. in our study, we find that when people infrastructure resilience, they are, for the most part, infrastructuring everyday care. initially, when people routinely engage in infrastructuring, infrastructuring is geared towards caring for the self and/or their families and/or communities. over time, ultimately, infrastructuring was geared more towards caring for society. for example, in the context of our lgbtq case study, people initially wrote narratives to reflexively understand themselves; they then turned towards helping others in their community; and finally, they started infrastructuring as a means of pushing back against harmful heteronormative structures. while routine infrastructuring has great potential to be used for social good, it also has the potential to harm. that is, as people try to mitigate the impacts of the everyday disruptions they face, the infrastructuring practices and subsequent socio-technical infrastructures they develop can impact people in potentially adverse ways. for example, in our iraq case study, we observed how although people did benefit from the use of community generators, not all the providers of said generators may have necessarily had the social good in mind. these types of situations also inherently hold the potential to create more power differentials within society, as those who can afford generators and fuel gain power and economic advantage over others who need their services. as designers of socio-technical systems, it is imperative that as we develop and study socio-technical infrastructures, we continue to deeply consider both the invisible positive aspects in addition to ethical and moral dilemmas that may arise, as a form of community care work, while simultaneously thinking about how we can build socio-technical systems that promote resilience, and thus caring for others.",893
Collaboration Drives Individual Productivity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359176,"how does the number of collaborators affect individual productivity? results of prior research have been conflicting, with some studies reporting an increase in individual productivity as the number of collaborators grows, while other studies showing that the free-rider effect skews the effort invested by individuals, making larger groups less productive. the difference between these schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their efficiency. we address this question by studying two planetary-scale collaborative systems: github and wikipedia. by analyzing the activity of over 2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics: the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but saturates at larger sizes. this effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the individual level. people tend to do more when collaborating with more people. we propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the non-linearity in collaboration effort. the proposed model is able to explain and predict group work dynamics in github and wikipedia by capturing their maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a principled, data-driven science of collaboration. identifying the universal principles which apply to group productivity appears to be within the interest of various scientific disciplines. the complexity of human interactions and the heterogeneity of groups in terms of types and purposes makes this quest particularly challenging. prior research demonstrates multiple conflicting results about the relationship between group size and productivity. in our attempt to untangle certain principles of collaborative work, we analyzed github, a webbased collaboration platform for software projects and wikipedia, online encyclopedia. first we identify some limitations of our work and then we summarize our main findings and contributions. we acknowledge that our results on collaborative work should not be unconditionally generalized across domains. the data used in the study is collected from two different platforms: github, used mostly by people who work in software development and wikipedia which attracts users of many various interests. each platform imposes its norms and dictates particular behaviors which can trigger domain-specific communication and work patterns. the groups in other work setups could exhibit a different behavior, hence one should be cautious about the absolute generalization of the provided results. the definition of productivity varies among disciplines and authors. however, we equate the productivity with the amount of work, ignoring the nuances such as the time invested or the actual value of work. we used data covering more than 40 million actions performed by 2 million users working on 4.7 million projects on github and 23 million edits performed by 700 thousand users on 2.6 million pages on wikipedia. we explore the super-linear relationship of productivity as a function of number of collaborators on a project and show that adding a new collaborator in a group is often beneficial. an additional collaborator boosts the average work in a group, suggesting a synergistic nature in groups that causes users to perform significantly better than when working individually. we show that the productivity of a group as a whole is the result of increased productivity of all individual members, and not simply due to the presence of a few super-performing individuals. the heterogeneity and high variance of users’ productivity makes it difficult to claim that the above phenomenon is more than an aggregate behavior and holds at the individual user level. however, by exploiting the fact the users work on multiple projects, we are able to demonstrate that people are more productive in larger groups. given the choice to work on multiple projects, people put more effort into projects with more collaborators. the relation between group size and individual invested work is positive across all observed group sizes and it is particularly strong when the groups are still relatively small. for larger groups, that relation becomes less prominent and approaches zero. overall, our results show that there is a super-linear relationship, but it is characterized by decreasing scaling exponent as groups become larger. this shows that the high productivity in larger groups is not the artifact of a small fraction of highly-productive individuals, but rather the result of a more universal preference pattern. besides the group size, we analyze a set of other factors which can drive user’s productivity. we use s3d, a version of regression tree algorithm, to find the most informative features. then, we extend this analysis by quantifying the linear relationships between the invested work and corresponding confounds.",894
Should We Use an Abstract Comic Form to Persuade?: Experiments with Online Charitable Donation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359177,"this paper examines the use of the abstract comic form for persuading online charitable donations. persuading individuals to contribute to charitable causes online is hard and responses to the appeals are typically low; charitable donations share the structure of public goods dilemmas where the rewards are distant and non-exclusive. in this paper, we examine if comics in abstract form are more persuasive than in the plain text form. drawing on a rich literature on comics, we synthesized a three-panel abstract comic to create our appeal. we conducted a between-subject study with 307 participants from amazon mechanical turk on the use of abstract comic form to appeal for charitable donations. as part of our experimental procedure, we sought to persuade individuals to contribute to a real charity focused on autism research with monetary costs. we compared the average amount of donation to the charity under three conditions: the plain text message, an abstract comic that includes the plain text, and an abstract comic that additionally includes the social proof. we use bayesian modeling to analyze the results, motivated by model transparency and its use in small-sized studies. our experiments reveal that the message in abstract comic form elicited significantly more donations than text form (medium to large effect size=0.59). incorporating social proof in the abstract comic message did not show a significant effect. our studies have design implications: non-profits and governmental agencies interested in alleviating public goods dilemmas that share a similar structure to our experiment (single-shot task, distant, non-exclusive reward) ought to consider including messages in the abstract comic form as part of their online fund-raising campaign. inspired by a rich history in persuasive test messages construction and benefits of abstract comics in communication, this paper examined if the abstract comic form is more persuasive than the corresponding plain text in the context of encouraging participants to donate for charitable causes. we conducted a field study on amazon mechanical turk with 307 participants. in the study, participants received one of the three persuasive messages designed to ask for a donation to the organization of autism research, a persuasive text message, a three-panel comic strip, and a three-panel comic strip incorporating the idea of social proof, and made donation decisions with real money. we analyzed the results using a hierarchical bayesian framework that allows for understanding effect sizes, as well are transparent and helpful in small-n studies. the results shows convincingly that the three-panel abstract comic is more persuasive than the text (a medium to large effect size = 0.59). we also show that while the comic with social proof increases the donation level over the comic without the norm, the effect size is very small (0.11) and the increase is not significant. to summarize, the comic form significantly increases donations over the plain text, but the presence of the norm is not effective. we caution that the result holds for single-shot, public goods tasks; the value of the social proof in the comic, for exclusive tasks with distant rewards such as exercise, or dieting needs future research. the main implication of our work is that non-profits and governmental agencies ought to consider using abstract comic in their online campaign as they work to alleviate public goods dilemmas. we believe that these agencies can easily include the use of the comic form as part of their overall messaging strategy because the simplicity of the abstract comic form allows it to be easily synthesized and to additionally incorporate social proofs. as next steps, we plan to develop an algorithmic framework that automatically maps a person’s behavioral data (e.g. amount walked this week) to a three-panel persuasive comic. we also plan to conduct longitudinal field experiments with an emphasis on storytelling where individuals receive three-panel comics over time, and comics are connected with a storyline.",895
Understanding Expert Disagreement in Medical Data Analysis through Structured Adjudication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359178,"expert disagreement is pervasive in clinical decision making and collective adjudication is a useful approach for resolving divergent assessments. prior work shows that expert disagreement can arise due to diverse factors including expert background, the quality and presentation of data, and guideline clarity. in this work, we study how these factors predict initial discrepancies in the context of medical time series analysis, examining why certain disagreements persist after adjudication, and how adjudication impacts clinical decisions. results from a case study with 36 experts and 4,543 adjudicated cases in a sleep stage classification task show that these factors contribute to both initial disagreement and resolvability, each in their own unique way. we provide evidence suggesting that structured adjudication can lead to significant revisions in treatment-relevant clinical parameters. our work demonstrates how structured adjudication can support consensus and facilitate a deep understanding of expert disagreement in medical data analysis. in this work, we introduced a novel perspective on the problem of expert disagreement in medical data analysis using a structured form of collaborative adjudication to study the nature and dynamics of disagreement from a socio-technical perspective. we demonstrated the applicability of our approach in the context of medical time series analysis for sleep stage classification, and showcased how the structured data produced can facilitate a deep understanding of the diverse factors playing a role in generating and resolving disagreements, including expert background, data complexity, viewer settings and classification guidelines. our proposed workflow for structured adjudication has implications for the design of decision support for clinical group decision making and for the collection of expert-labelled data in the context of other applications like computer-aided diagnosis.",896

Intentional Technology Use in Early Childhood Education,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359180,"early childhood is a critical developmental period when children's experiences have lasting impacts on long-term outcomes. thus, an evidence-based understanding of how technology can support early childhood education (ece) classrooms promises to be disproportionately useful to children's long-term wellbeing. we conducted an observational study at ten child-care centers, complemented by interviews with teachers and directors. using a uses and gratifications (u&g) perspective, we found that the gratifications teachers seek when they incorporate technology into the classroom cluster into six categories, such as encouraging technology literacy, regulating children's behavior, and supporting child autonomy. using these themes, we contribute a set of design priorities for supporting this population. we also contribute an expansion of the u&g perspective to include: 1) gratifications resisted, to account for the ways in which teachers resist gratifying uses of technology, and 2) differentiation between direct gratifications and indirect gratifications to better describe technology use in collaborative contexts. early childhood is a critical period when the introduction of technology can have long-lasting effects on a child’s growth and development. we applied the uses & gratifications theory (u&g) to examine the situated ways in which technology is used in classrooms today (documented through classroom observations), and we further examined the gratifications teachers sought when they enacted these uses (documented through interviews). we found that teachers make intentional and thoughtful choices in how they use technology in the classroom, motivated by a concise set of common gratifications. the need to support child autonomy, introduce children to a technology-rich world, leverage technology to manage the classroom, among others, led to a vast array of creative and diverse usage scenarios, ranging from pretend play with discarded keyboards to carefully-curated playlists of music to signal transitions. by distilling the core driving factors that motivate teachers’ use, we outline a space of design possibilities–including child-curated music, technologies for dedicated purposes, and tools for child-driven data capture. we also show how u&g currently provides an incomplete picture of the ways in which teachers think about gratifications and translate them into usage behaviors. thus, a further contribution of this work is an expansion of u&g to include gratifications resisted and direct/indirect gratifications. through these new constructs, we hope to make this highly productive, and long-standing theory of greater use to cscw and social computing researchers.",898
Love in Lyrics: An Exploration of Supporting Textual Manifestation of Affection in Social Messaging,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359181,"affectionate communication, the conveyance of closeness, care, and fondness for another, plays a key role in romantic relationships. while the pervasive use of digital technology for communication limits affectionate interaction through nonverbal cues -- a major channel of expression in face-to-face settings, there have been few approaches which scaffold couples' romantic text conversations. to bridge this gap, we propose a novel interactive system lily which gives users inspirations to enrich their romantic expressions in text messaging. it first listens to users' original input and then recommends romantic lyrics holding the closest meaning in real-time during chats with partners. after a three-day empirical study, participants who are real-life couples reported that they not only received useful cues from lily in terms of how to polish their affectionate expressions, but also learnt to enrich the conversation with topics enlightened by its recommendations. based on our findings, we finally provide several design considerations for actual deployment of such an application. in this paper, we proposed lily, an interactive system that allows users to refine their affectionate communications by suggesting similar, but richer expressions in real-time text messaging. we utilized romantic song lyrics as a data source to present recommendations. lily first reads users’ original input and then it returns three recommendations in real-time, which are randomly selected among the top 0.1% with similar meanings. these are different expressions chosen from 18,777 lines of lyrics. through a three-day empirical study, we found that lily helps users get inspired to refine their affectionate expressions indeed, despite its suggestions being less adequate in instrumental conversation. it is reported that users can refer to lily’s recommendations not just for enriching affectionate expressions, but also for augmenting the conversation with topics enlightened by its recommendations. in addition, we derived several design considerations from study results and participant feedback. we hope this work attracts more researchers to design systems which facilitate emotional communications between human subjects.",899

Improving Social Awareness Through DANTE: Deep Affinity Network for Clustering Conversational Interactants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392824,"we propose a data-driven approach to detect conversational groups by identifying spatial arrangements typical of these focused social encounters. our approach uses a novel deep affinity network (dante) to predict the likelihood that two individuals in a scene are part of the same conversational group, considering their social context. the predicted pair-wise affinities are then used in a graph clustering framework to identify both small (e.g., dyads) and large groups. the results from our evaluation on multiple, established benchmarks suggest that combining powerful deep learning methods with classical clustering techniques can improve the detection of conversational groups in comparison to prior approaches. finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach in a human-robot interaction scenario. our efforts show that our work advances group detection not only in theory, but also in practice. we presented a novel approach for conversational group detection. our method combined graph clustering with modern deep learning techniques to identify group interactions based on visual patterns of spatial behavior. under the challenging t=1 f1 metric, our method significantly outperformed or performed as well as previous methods in a variety of conversational group detection benchmarks. additionally, we obtained good results under the gdsr metric in a more general group detection task, showing the generalization capabilities of our proposed approach. from an algorithmic point of view, clear improvements were derived from better affinity scores used for graph clustering in comparison to prior work. additionally, the use of data-driven methods allowed our approach to cope with complex spatial patterns of behavior without ad-hoc steps to verify group interactions. these features made our approach robust and practical to be applied in a real human-robot interaction scenario.",904
Real Differences between OT and CRDT in Correctness and Complexity for Consistency Maintenance in Co-Editors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392825,"ot (operational transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. crdt (commutative replicated data type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of woot (without operational transformation). follow-up crdt variations are commonly labeled as ""post-ot"" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors. on top of that, crdt solutions have made broad claims of superiority over ot solutions, and often portrayed ot as an incorrect and inefficient technique. over one decade later, however, crdt is rarely found in working co-editors; ot remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. contradictions between the reality and crdt's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. to seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative ot and crdt solutions and working co-editors based on them. from this work, we have made important discoveries about ot and crdt, and revealed facts and evidences that refute crdt claims over ot on all accounts. these discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between ot and crdt in the real world. we report these results in a series of three articles. in this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between ot and crdt in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative crdt solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of ot and crdt. we hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding ot and crdt, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications. in this work, we have conducted comprehensive and critical reviews of representative ot and crdt solutions for consistency maintenance in real-time co-editing, and made important research discoveries, which contribute to the advancement of the state-of-the-art knowledge on collaboration-enabling technology. this paper is the second in a series of three papers reporting our discoveries from this work. we summarize the main discoveries reported in this paper below, together with a brief description of the results reported in prior and follow-up papers as well. in the first paper [78], we have presented a general transformation framework for examining and comparing ot and crdt, among a variety of consistency maintenance solutions in coediting, and revealed previously hidden but critical facts about crdt: crdt is like ot in following the same general transformation approach to consistency maintenance, albeit indirectly (in contrast to the direct transformation approach by ot); crdt is the same as ot in making user-generated operations commutative after the fact; and crdt operations are not natively commutative to editors, but require additional conversions between crdt internal operations and external editing operations. revealing these facts helps demystify what crdt really is and is not to co-editing, and provide much-needed clarity for examining and understanding the real differences between ot and crdt for co-editors ̶ their radically different ways of realizing the same general transformation. in the current paper, we have exploredwhat really differentiates ot and crdt in correctness and complexity. one key insight from this investigation is: ot is concurrency-centric in the sense it treats generic concurrency issues among operations as its first priority at the core control algorithms, and isolates the handling of application-specific data and operation modelling issues in transformation functions; whereas crdt is content-centric in the sense that it takes the first priority to manipulate internal application-related contents, including object sequences and schemes for searching and applying identifier-based operations in the object sequence, but mixes the handling of concurrency issues within object search and manipulation schemes. the concurrency-centric vs content-centric difference, together with the direct vs indirect difference in transformation, are fundamental and have profound implications to ot and crdt solutions. the first significant implication is found in the different design and correctness issues in ot and crdt solutions. key ot design issues include designing core control algorithms to deal with generic concurrency issues, and designing separate transformation functions to handle application-specific issues. ot-special technical challenges and puzzles, such as ensuring contextbased conditions (e.g. the dopt puzzle was a case of violating the context-equivalence condition), and avoiding or preserving cp2 (e.g. the ft puzzle was a case of violating the cp2 property in plain-text co-editing), were rooted in and solved under the concurrency-centric approach. past ot research has established context-based conditions and transformation properties as the theoretic foundation for verifying and guiding the design of ot solutions. the correctness of key ot components in major ot solutions, including generic control algorithms and transformation functions for a range of operation and data models (e.g. string-wise plain-text editing and beyond), has been established on top of this theoretic foundation. in contrast, key crdt design issues include designing crdt-special data structures for representing the character sequence of the external document in an internal object sequence, immutable identifier-based operations, searching and executing identifier-based operations in the object sequence, and conversions between internal identifier-based operations and external position-based operations, which collectively deal with both application-specific and concurrency issues in co-editing. this approach has induced crdt-specific challenges and puzzles, such as c/ct-based complexity, tombstone overhead, complexity with variable identifiers, etc. in this work, we have revealed various correctness problems with logoot (a representative non-tombstonebased crdt), including inconsistent-position-integer-ordering, infinite loop flaws, position-orderviolation puzzles, and concurrent-insert-interleaving abnormalities. it remains an open challenge to resolve those issues under the crdt approach to co-editing. the correctness of key crdt components (e.g. object sequences, operation identifiers, and object sequence searching and manipulation schemes) in various crdt solutions remains to be verified, using well-defined criteria, which are yet to be established as well. the second significant implication is found in the different time and space complexities among ot and crdt solutions. ot complexity is determined by a variable c (for concurrency) ─ the number of concurrent operations involved in transforming an operation; crdt complexity is dominated by a variable c (for contents) or ct (for content with tombstones) ─ the number of objects maintained in the internal object sequence. in terms of theoretic complexity (see details in table 4), crdt has time complexities o(c) or o(ct) for local operation processing, whereas ot has o(1) complexity. in terms of time complexity for remote processing and space complexity, both crdt and ot have achieved linear complexities under respective variables c (for ot) and c/ct (for crdts), which are seemingly similar in theory, but significantly different in practice: c is often bounded by a small value, e.g. 0 ≤ c ≤ 10, for a real-time session with a few (e.g. less than 5) users; c is orders of magnitude larger than c, e.g. 103 ≤ c ≤ 106 , for common plain text document sizes ranging from 1k to 1m characters; and ct could be much larger than c due to the inclusion of tombstones. in real-time text co-editing, the following inequality commonly holds: ct ≫ c ≫ c. it remains an open challenge to devise ct/c-based crdt solutions that could match c-based ot solutions in time and space complexity and in practical performance. the third implication is in the generality and extendibility of ot and crdt solutions for coeditors. ot solutions separate generic concurrency issues from application-specific data and operation issues, with the core control algorithms being generally applicable to different application domains beyond text editing. extensions of existing ot solutions can be and have been achieved by designing new transformation functions for new applications, without reinventing core control algorithms. in contrast, crdt solutions mix concurrency issues with application-specific data and operation issues, with key crdt components being intricately related to each other and coupled with application-specific object sequences and operations. the vast majority of published crdt solutions for co-editing have been confined to plain-text editing. in the follow-up (the third) paper of this series [79], we report our discoveries on the differences between ot and crdt in building co-editing systems and real world applications. in particular, we investigate the role of building co-editing systems in shaping ot and crdt research and solutions. we review the evolution of co-editors from research vehicles to real world applications, and discuss representative ot-based co-editors and alternative design approaches in industry products and open source projects. moreover, we evaluate crdt-based co-editors in relation to published crdt solutions, and re-confirm that crdt operations and object sequences are not native to any editors. last but not least, we examine technical factors related to ""peer-to-peer"" co-editing, such as the use of central servers, causally-ordered communication, and vector/scalar timestamping. our study revealed all these factors are orthogonal to ot and crdt, and the notion that crdt is especially suitable for supporting ""peerto-peer"" co-editing is a fallacy. in summary, we have critically reviewed and compared representative ot and crdt solutions, with respect to their basic approaches to consistency maintenance, correctness, time and space complexity, implementation and application in building co-editors, and suitability for peer-to-peer co-editing. the facts and evidences revealed from this work disprove crdt superiority claims over ot on all accounts. these results help explain the underlying reasons behind the choices between ot and crdt in real world co-editors and industrial products. numerous alternative consistency maintenance solutions have been explored in past coediting research, and a wealth of experiences and lessons have been accumulated from those explorations. the time is ripe to review them critically and reflect on: what each alternative really is and has achieved so far, whether it has been validated by or is relevant to real world applications, and whither it is heading. this critical review work on ot and crdt represents one attempt in this direction. for any alternative to be a viable solution in co-editing, in our view, it should offer capabilities that are genuinely superior to existing state-of-the-art solutions, and demonstrate its relevance in supporting real world co-editors. it is the real world application that provides ultimate validation to alternative solutions and to co-editing research in general. we hope discoveries from this work will help clear up common myths and misconceptions surrounding ot and crdt, inspire fruitful explorations of novel collaboration techniques, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology innovation and real world application.",905

Roles, Workflows, and Tools",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392826,"today, the prominence of data science within organizations has given rise to teams of data science workers collaborating on extracting insights from data, as opposed to individual data scientists working alone. however, we still lack a deep understanding of how data science workers collaborate in practice. in this work, we conducted an online survey with 183 participants who work in various aspects of data science. we focused on their reported interactions with each other (e.g., managers with engineers) and with different tools (e.g., jupyter notebook). we found that data science teams are extremely collaborative and work with a variety of stakeholders and tools during the six common steps of a data science workflow (e.g., clean data and train model). we also found that the collaborative practices workers employ, such as documentation, vary according to the kinds of tools they use. based on these findings, we discuss design implications for supporting data science team collaborations and future research directions. in this paper, we presented results of a large-scale survey of data science workers at a major corporation that examined how data science workers collaborate. we find that not only do data science workers collaborate extensively, they perform a variety of roles, and work with a variety of stakeholders during different stages of the data science project workflow. we also investigated the tools that data scientists use when collaborating, and how tool usage relates to collaborative practices such as code and data documentation. from this analysis, we present directions for future research and development of data science collaboration tools. in summary, we hope we have made the following contributions: • the first large in-depth survey about data science collaborative practices, and the first large study to provide roles-based analyses of collaborations. • the first large-scale study of data science activities during specific stages of data science projects. • the first analysis of collaborative tools usage across the stages of data science projects. • the first large-scale analysis of documentation practices in data science.",906
"""It's easier than causing confrontation"": Sanctioning Strategies to Maintain Social Norms and Privacy on Social Media",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392827,"sanctions play an essential role in enforcing and sustaining social norms. on social networking sites (sns), sanctions allow individuals to shape community norms on appropriate privacy respecting behaviors. existing theories of privacy assume the use of such sanctions but do not examine the extent and effectiveness of sanctioning behaviors. we conducted a qualitative interview study of young adults (n=23), and extend research on collective boundary regulation by studying sanctions in the context of popular sns. through a systematization of sanctioning strategies, we find that young adults prefer to use indirect and invisible sanctions to preserve strong-tie relationships. such sanctions are not always effective in helping the violator understand the nature of their normative violation. we offer suggestions on supporting online sanctioning that make norms more visible and signal violations in ways that avoid direct confrontation to reduce the risk of harming on-going social relationships. in today’s networked world individuals collaborate to regulate what is shared online. this collaboration between both content creators and viewers serves to shape and reinforce norms on appropriate privacy behaviors and content sharing on social networking sites. sanctions play an essential role in this process to sustain social norms, thereby protecting privacy. our study explored how young adults sanction norm violations regarding inappropriate content and their privacy behaviors across different social media. through our findings, we systematize sanctioning strategies along three dimensions: who performs the sanction (a person or a group), where they sanction (on-site or off-site), and how apparent the sanction is to the violator (visible or invisible). in studying these strategies, we find that young adults are more than aware that imposing sanctions can come at a personal cost for those who want to maintain their relationships and avoid conflict. as a result, they often sought out discreet – indirect and invisible – sanctions despite their potential to fail in making the violator aware of the violation. we posit that for sanctions to achieve their goals of shaping online behaviors, we need tools that make online norms visible to the violator and signal violations when they occur without unnecessary burden or direct personal conflict. in the process, all parties might be better able to ‘save face’ and the relationships with each other that they value so much.",907
"""They Just Don't Get It"": Towards Social Technologies for Coping with Interpersonal Racism",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392828,"over 35% of americans belong to racial minority groups. racism targeting these individuals results in a range of harmful physical, psychological, and practical consequences. the present work aims to shed light on the current sense-making and support-seeking practices exhibited by targets of racism, as well as to identify the core needs and barriers that future socio-technical interventions could potentially address. the long-term goal of this work is to understand how cscw researchers and designers could best support members of marginalized groups to make sense of and to seek support for experiences with racism. narrative episode interviews with targets of racism revealed a number of key entry points for intervention. for example, participants' personal stories confirmed that uncertainty, both about the nature and consequences of the experience of racism, is a key motivator for support-seeking. in addition, despite the need for support, participants largely do not trust public forms of social media for support-seeking. we discuss how participants' accounts of the complex labor involved in determining who ""gets it"" in identifying potential supporters, and in navigating the complexities of trust and agency in sharing their experiences, present clear implications for the design of new socio-technical platforms for members of racial minority groups. seeking social support following racist experiences can be a challenge for targets of racism. in both online and offline contexts, there is a substantial risk of emotional, psychological, and practical consequences. additionally, the ambiguous nature of experiences of modern racism complicate coping and provide additional barriers to support-seeking. in this work, we explore the complexities and nuances involved in seeking support following experiences with racism. we find that uncertainty surrounding the nature of the experience as well as its consequences is a primary motivator for support-seeking behavior. once a target has shared with a potential supporter, supporters and targets work together to make meaning of the event through uncertainty reduction. this is typically only possible when a supporter first validates the subjective experience of the target, either in-the-moment or through previous interactions with the target. when potential supporters introduce additional uncertainty during the meaning-making process, it hampers the coping of the target. targets engage in a number of practices to ensure that they have ready access to potential supporters, such as cultivating relevant relationships before a racist experience occurs. from these findings, we demonstrate opportunities for researchers and designers who wish to create solutions that facilitate coping through support-seeking following racist experiences. this work may have implications beyond the context of vulnerable groups. prejudice and discrimination are experienced alongside a wide range of facets of identity. for example, previous work on microaggressions explores gender, racial-ethnic identity, and sexual orientation. our work examines how people from racially marginalized groups successfully cope with experiences of racist oppression in an effort to uncover opportunities and challenges in amplifying and supporting those practices at scale, but we believe that this approach can be extended to other marginalized populations as well. we envision a future where sociotechnical systems promote the safety and empowerment of people from marginalized groups in fighting against their experiences with prejudice and marginalization by sharing, communicating, and supporting each other. this work is intended to provide a foundation for other members of the cscw community to respond to this challenge and contribute to a growing body of theoretical, empirical, and technical work that helps bring that future closer to reality.",908
How to Support Newcomers in Scientific Hackathons - An Action Research Study on Expert Mentoring,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392830,"time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. they only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. it also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival. we are currently in the process of developing the second cycle of the presented action research study which will take place within the same community. using the aspects outlined in the discussion as a basis we developed guiding materials for organizers and mentors (sections 5.1 and 5.2) that will we use during the planning phase of the hackathon. changes to the format include checkpoints for teams to get early feedback, suggestions for mentors to abstain from assuming a stakeholder role, connect to students and focus on students’ learning gains rather than the completion of a pre-envisioned project. the data collection procedure and instruments used will remain largely the same with a stronger focus on the mentors since most suggestions we developed are targeted at them. we will also alter the focus of the data collection to assess the impact of the aforementioned interventions and include an additional data collection point three to six months after the hackathon to identify potential long-term effects related to the projects that were developed during the hackathon. moreover, to better cover the community engagement aspect of the studied hackathon we will add a corresponding scale to the questionnaire. the proposed scale has been successfully been used in the context of online communities [22] to assess individual commitment to and identification with a community. in this paper we presented findings from an action research study on assigning community members as mentors to teams of newcomers during a scientific hackathon. our findings provided tentative insights into the interaction between mentors and teams and their perception of their hackathon project and their future intentions towards the community that organized the hackathon. our work not only addresses an important shortcoming in scientific literature on hackathons by studying mentoring in a specific hackathon event. our findings can also support scientific communities to use hackathons as a means to attract newcomers which is crucial for their survival.",909
Evaluating News Media Reports on the 'Blue Whale Challenge' for Adherence to Suicide Prevention Safe Messaging Guidelines,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392831,"the blue whale challenge (bwc) is an online viral ""game"" that allegedly encourages youth and young adults towards self-harming behaviors that could eventually lead to suicide. the bwc can be situated within a larger phenomenon of viral online self-harm challenges, which may be propagated through both social media and news sources. research has established that suicide is a global public health issue that is known to be influenced by media reporting. violation of safe messaging guidelines has been shown to increase imitative suicides, particularly in youth and young adults. given the confirmed effects of news media reporting, we analyzed 150 digital newspaper articles reporting on the bwc to assess whether they adhered to suicide prevention safe messaging guidelines. overall, 81% of the articles violated at least one contagion-related guideline, most commonly normalizing suicide, discussing means of suicide, and sensationalizing. even though the majority (91%) of the articles adhered to at least one health-promotion guideline, such as emphasizing prevention, the articles did not follow these guidelines on a deep and comprehensive level. through thematic analysis, we also found evidence of potential misinformation in reporting, where the articles unequivocally attributed many suicides to the bwc with little or no evidence. additionally, articles often stated an individual's reason for participating in the challenge without interviewing the individual or those close to the individual, another aspect of potential misinformation due to lack of evidence. a contribution of the current study is the synthesis of safe messaging guidelines that can be used in future research. this study contributes to the understanding of news reporting practices regarding suicide and self-harm in regard to the bwc and similar online challenges. we discuss how sensationalized news media reports on the bwc could unintentionally propagate suicide contagion effects that normalize self-harming behaviors among youth. we then examine implications for practice and policy, such using automated approaches to aid reporters in adhering to safe messaging guidelines. our study synthesizes suicide prevention safe messaging guidelines and evaluates news practices regarding the blue whale challenge. in sum, it is evident that there is still room for improvement in the realm of reporting on suicide, self-harm, and harmful online challenges in the media to combat the problem of contagion. a major contribution of the current study is the synthesis of what were previously disjointed sets of suicide prevention safe messaging guidelines. overall, our findings reinforce the notion that adherence to safe messaging guidelines is not yet adequate. we also found evidence of misinformation, as authors often used causational language and speculated about why individuals participated in the bwc without evidence. our findings lead to recommending interventions such as further education of news reporters and application of recent advances in natural language processing software in order to decrease contagion. there is an opportunity to dampen the harmful consequences that result from poor quality reports of suicidal behavior and decrease the potential for suicide contagion in reporting on online selfharm and suicide.",910
Methods for Generating Typologies of Non/use,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392832,"prior studies of technology non-use demonstrate the need for approaches that go beyond a simple binary distinction between users and non-users. this paper proposes a set of two different methods by which researchers can identify types of non/use relevant to the particular sociotechnical settings they are studying. these methods are demonstrated by applying them to survey data about facebook non/use. the results demonstrate that the different methods proposed here identify fairly comparable types of non/use. they also illustrate how the two methods make different trade offs between the granularity of the resulting typology and the total sample size. the paper also demonstrates how the different typologies resulting from these methods can be used in predictive modeling, allowing for the two methods to corroborate or disconfirm results from one another. the discussion considers implications and applications of these methods, both for research on technology non/use and for studying social computing more broadly.",911
From Paper Flight Strips to Digital Strip Systems: Changes and Similarities in Air Traffic Control Work Practices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392833,"to increase capacity and safety in air traffic control, digital strip systems have superseded paper strips in lower airspace control centers in europe. previous ethnographic studies on paper strip systems anticipated a radical change in work practices with digital strip systems, but we are not aware of any studies that evaluated these predictions. we carried out contextual inquiries with controllers and focused on face-to-face and radio communication, interactions with the digital strip system and the workspace in general. in turn, we contribute (1) detailed descriptions of controllers' work practices, such as using tacit information from radio communication and 'standard advocates vs. tinkerers' operation modes, (2) respective implications for design and (3) discuss how the observed work practices are similar or different from the reported practices in the literature of the two preceding decades. our key insights are, that documentation speed is faster with digital strips, although a high load in the case of radio frequency persists. controllers retrieve tacit information from the radio communication and combine it with scattered cues from several displays to form empathic decisions that sometimes exceed the standard protocol. we conclude that the role of tacit information holds opportunities for future flight systems and should be considered in a holistic approach to individualized workspaces for controllers. in this article, we present observation and interview data on how controllers are actually using digital strip system workstations today. air traffic management is designed to be a highly standardized safety-critical workplace. our key insights indicate, however, that (1) controllers are most efficient when they also have access to tacit information such as emotions or the fitness of pilots. based on this tacit information and given the scarce information from the ground radar, (2) experienced approach controllers took educated guesses that were beneficial to the structure of arrivals and departures. the price for these meta-information conveyed through human language is that (3) radio communication is today’s bottleneck in atc capacity because it limits the number of aircraft a single controller can manage. to achieve more efficiency and to please pilots in medium traffic, (4) controllers’ work styles exceed standard protocols. finally, both our interview data and the literature indicate that (5) digital strip systems run more stable and enable controllers to document faster compared to paper strips. in safety-critical domains such as atc, stability and faster interactions leave more resources for other tasks and therefore are likely to promote safety. therefore, we tend to answer negatively to the question “is paper safer?” compared to digital strip systems posed by mackay [34] over two decades ago. with the rise in text-based communications and further transitions towards strip-independent interfaces, such as a single view of air traffic, the advantage of digital interfaces in terms of safety and capacity will become even more obvious. because digital paper strips were merely designed as transitional system in electronic flight data management to increase automation [18], this raises questions for future research about how much capacity atc systems will have once the transition is completed. from our key insights we derived implications for future systems in air traffic control. a digital workplace facilitates assistive systems and individualization, which are partly implemented already and offer great potential to increase efficiency and safety. our findings indicate, that in future atc systems relevant information needs to be presented in one individualized workspace, which is tailored to the needs outlined above and replaces the cluster of hardware modules grown over decades. increased automation and transition to text communication, for example for standard clearances, may help to diminish the capacity restriction caused by radio communication. however, designers need to find holistic concepts that still harvest the benefits of tacit information to uphold the controllers’ team situation awareness about the pilots’ context. an example of how this can be achieved is the shared information on the ground radar that helps controllers to assess the tower controllers’ needs. the transition to novel interfaces will bear the challenge for designers to incorporate control over partly automated steps. most important, there is an opportunity to sustain and enhance future flight systems to harness the rich information and appreciative collegiality contained in communication among actors on the ground and in the air.",912
The Effect of Sociocultural Variables on Sarcasm Communication Online,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392834,"online social networks (osn) play an essential role for connecting people and allowing them to communicate online. osn users share their thoughts, moments, and news with their network. the messages they share online can include sarcastic posts, where the intended meaning expressed by the written text is different from the literal one. this could result in miscommunication. previous research in psycholinguistics has studied the sociocultural factors the might lead to sarcasm misunderstanding between speakers and listeners. however, there is a lack of such studies in the context of osn. in this paper we fill this gap by performing a quantitative analysis on the influence of sociocultural variables, including gender, age, country, and english language nativeness, on the effectiveness of sarcastic communication online. we collect examples of sarcastic tweets directly from the authors who posted them. further, we ask third-party annotators of different sociocultural backgrounds to label these tweets for sarcasm. our analysis indicates that age, english language nativeness, and country are significantly influential and should be considered in the design of future social analysis tools that either study sarcasm directly, or look at related phenomena where sarcasm may have an influence. we also make observations about the social ecology surrounding sarcastic exchanges on osns. we conclude by suggesting ways in which our findings can be included in future work. in this paper we have considered how sarcastic communication in osns can be influenced by the sociocultural backgrounds of the interlocutors. we asked whether similar backgrounds lead to more effective communication, which sociocultural variables have the most influence on the effectiveness, and whether the influence is alleviated by the presence of contextual information found publicly on the osns. consulting psycholinguistic studies of sarcastic communication, as well as linguistic theories as sarcasm, we chose four variables for investigation: gender, age, country, and english language nativeness. for our experiments, we collected sarcastic tweets from twitter users who posted them (whom we call speakers), implicitly labelled by the users themselves (intended labels). we then had third-party annotators (whom we call listeners) further label these tweets for sarcasm (perceived labels). finally, we compared intended and perceived labels using f-score as a quantifier for similarity. our results indicate that age, english language nativeness, and gender are statistically influential. the influence of age is maintained even when contextual information is available. we suggest that these variables, along with public social information, should be included in the future design of social analysis tools that either investigate sarcasm directly, or look at related phenomena where sarcasm may have an influence, such as the expression of sentiment, emotion, and hate-speech. we also made observations regarding social behaviour. we noted a more effective sarcastic communication across genders in the uk compared to the us, but more effective across ages in the us compared to the uk. furthermore, we noted that uk females may use a more apparent form of sarcasm, compared to the more subtle sarcasm of us speakers. finally, contextual information seemed more indicative of the sarcasm of us males than of that of uk females. in future work we plan to address the main limitations of the current work. first, despite being the largest study of its kind to out knowledge, we still only investigate two speaker backgrounds, f-25-34-uk and m-25-34-us. we plan to explore more in the future. second, we plan to account for potential variations in the usage of sarcasm across the united states. finally, we intend to study potential interactions between sociocultural variables. to make a statistically significant claim in this direction, we need labels from all possible sociocultural backgrounds spanned by the variables we consider, which we plan to collect in the future.",913
"""Learning for the Rise of China"": Exploring Uses and Gratifications of State-Owned Online Platform",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392835,"in january 2019, the chinese communist party launched the online platform xuexi qiangguo, which translates into ""learning for the rise of china."" within two months, xuexi became the top-downloaded item of the month on apple's app store in china. in response, we conducted an interview study with 28 active xuexi users to investigate their uses and gratifications of this state-owned online platform. our results reveal seven key motivations: compliance, self-status seeking, general information seeking, job support, entertainment, patriotism, and learning. this state-owned platform introduced a new model for official information dissemination and political communication through direct surveillance and monitoring, leveraging and fostering emotional attachment, and offering heterogeneous apolitical content. we discuss the intended and unintended ramifications of these components, highlighting the importance of future cscw research to critically engage with pluralist political narratives situated in varied societies, especially non-western democracies. in this paper, we presented a qualitative study on the uses and gratifications of the chinese application xuexi qiangguo and described the factors that influence people’s participation in this platform. people derive a variety of uses and gratifications from xuexi, and these gratifications can be influenced by various personal, organizational, and sociopolitical factors. we synthesized these gratifications into their influencing factors and underscored the state-owned platform’s uniqueness in guiding opinion and disseminating official information, namely employing direct surveillance, leveraging and fostering emotional attachment, and offering side apolitical content for discretionary use. we critically discussed the intended and unintended consequences of these components and situated the discussion in china’s unique historical, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts. finally, we highlighted the importance for future cscw researchers and practitioners to engage with local contexts and constructs when designing and evaluating artifacts like xuexi.",914
Designing a Chatbot as a Mediator for Promoting Deep Self-Disclosure to a Real Mental Health Professional,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392836,"chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. one promising application for chatbots is to elicit people's self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. as receiving one's deep self-disclosure is critical for mental health professionals to understand people's mental status, chatbots show great potential in the mental health domain. however, there is a lack of research addressing if and how people self-disclose sensitive topics to a real mental health professional (mhp) through a chatbot. in this work, we designed, implemented and evaluated a chatbot that offered three chatting styles; we also conducted a study with 47 participants who were randomly assigned into three groups where each group experienced the chatbot's self-disclosure at varying levels respectively. after using the chatbot for a few weeks, participants were introduced to a mhp and were asked if they would like to share their self-disclosed content with the mhp. if they chose to share, the participants had the option of changing (adding, deleting, and editing) the content they self-disclosed to the chatbot. comparing participants' self-disclosure data the week before and the week after sharing with the mhp, our results showed that, within each group, the depth of participants' self-disclosure to the chatbot remained after sharing with the mhp; participants exhibited deeper self-disclosure to the mhp through a more self-disclosing chatbot; further, through conversation log analysis, we found that some participants made different edits on their self-disclosed content before sharing it with the mhp. participants' interview and survey feedback suggested an interaction between participants' trust in the chatbot and their trust in the mhp, which further explained participants' self-disclosure behavior. this study investigates how a chatbot as a mediator can be used by people for self-disclosing to a mental health professional and how people’s trust in a chatbot interacts with their trust in a mental health professional. our findings suggest that the chatbot’s self-disclosure successfully elicits participants’ self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts and feelings not only to the chatbot but also to the mental health professional. our work also provides empirical evidence of different self-disclosure behavior, such as reducing or adding content, that people may take before sharing their self-disclosure to a chatbot with a mental health professional. several factors contributed to their behavior. on the one hand, we identified an effective chatbot design that has promising potential to serve as a mediator to promote self-disclosure to mental health professionals; on the other hand, several ethical issues are discussed for future chatbot designs.",915
Estimating Conversational Styles in Conversational Microtask Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392837,"crowdsourcing marketplaces have provided a large number of opportunities for online workers to earn a living. to improve satisfaction and engagement of such workers, who are vital for the sustainability of the marketplaces, recent works have used conversational interfaces to support the execution of a variety of crowdsourcing tasks. the rationale behind using conversational interfaces stems from the potential engagement that conversation can stimulate. prior works in psychology have also shown that conversational styles can play an important role in communication. there are unexplored opportunities to estimate a worker's conversational style with an end goal of improving worker satisfaction, engagement and quality. addressing this knowledge gap, we investigate the role of conversational styles in conversational microtask crowdsourcing. to this end, we design a conversational interface which supports task execution, and we propose methods to estimate the conversational style of a worker. our experimental setup was designed to empirically observe how conversational styles of workers relate with quality-related outcomes. results show that even a naive supervised classifier can predict the conversation style with high accuracy (80%), and crowd workers with an involvement conversational style provided a significantly higher output quality, exhibited a higher user engagement and perceived less cognitive task load in comparison to their counterparts. our findings have important implications on task design with respect to improving worker performance and their engagement in microtask crowdsourcing. in this work, we explored how the conversational style of a crowd worker could be reliably estimated during crowdsourcing microtasking, and the relationship between conversational styles and qualityrelated outcomes, worker engagement and cognitive task load. we addressed rq1 by proposing a coding scheme for style estimation based on the five dimensions of examined linguistic devices, and style prediction methods using either rich conversational data or limited conversational data. we answered rq2 by performing a crowdsourcing experiment to analyze the behaviour of crowd workers with different conversational styles during crowdsourcing microtasking in terms of the output quality, worker engagement and cognitive task load. we found that common classifiers could obtain a reasonably good accuracy in conversation style prediction. furthermore, experimental results revealed that workers’ involvement conversational style relates with higher output quality, higher user engagement and less perceived task load in tasks with higher difficulty.",916
The Role of Conversational Grounding in Supporting Symbiosis Between People and Digital Assistants,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392838,"in ""smart speaker'' digital assistant systems such as google home, there is no visual user interface, so people must learn about the system's capabilities and limitations by experimenting with different questions and commands. however, many new users give up quickly and limit their use to a few simple tasks. this is a problem for both the user and the system. users who stop trying out new things cannot learn about new features and functionality, and the system receives less data upon which to base future improvements. symbiosis---a mutually beneficial relationship---between ai systems like digital assistants and people is an important aspect of developing systems that are partners to humans and not just tools. in order to better understand requirements for symbiosis, we investigated the relationship between the types of digital assistant responses and users' subsequent questions, focusing on identifying interactions that were discouraging to users when speaking with a digital assistant. we conducted a user study with 20 participants who completed a series of information seeking tasks using the google home, and analyzed transcripts using a method based on applied conversation analysis. we found that the most common response from the google home, a version of ""sorry, i'm not sure how to help'', provided no feedback for participants to build on when forming their next question. however, responses that provided somewhat strange but tangentially related answers were actually more helpful for conversational grounding, which extended the interaction. we discuss the connection between grounding and symbiosis, and present recommendations for requirements for forming partnerships with digital assistants. licklider envisioned man-machine symbiosis in 1960, which he described as working together with a computer as closely as one would with a “colleague whose competence supplements your own” [29, p. 5]. many ai systems, including digital assistants, have the potential to build a mutually benecial partnership with people through providing support for learning by the system and by the user. our ndings showed that when the system encounters a question it cannot answer, the process of conversational grounding can bridge the gap between the system and the human user, as long as the system provides an opening for grounding to occur in the form of feedback about the ambiguity of the system’s ability to respond in that moment. this opening for grounding to happen is an opportunity to promote exploration and support learnability for both partners. therefore, we argue that machine learning models in digital assistants should be optimized not just for accuracy, but also for new opportunities for grounding. by combining advanced data-driven techniques with support for human conversation partners to form common ground about digital assistants, we argue that the symbiotic relationship can be achieved. these ndings and implications add to the growing body of knowledge on how to design meaningful human-ai interaction, and provide guidance to designers of digital assistants for exploring new ways to build symbiotic relationships between users and ai systems.",917
"I Share, You Care: Private Status Sharing and Sender-Controlled Notifications in Mobile Instant Messaging",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392839,"while mobile instant messaging (mim) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. we examine two design concepts for mim-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. we built mybutler, an android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with kakaotalk, a commercial mim app. during a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. we reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in mim communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of mim users in choosing whether to alert their messages. in terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. we found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations. we studied and analyzed how two design concepts for mim communication, private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications, impact mobile users’ chat behavior. we built mybutler, an android app prototype that enables the application of two design concepts, to work seamlessly with a commercial mim app, kakaotalk. we conducted a two-week field study using mybutler followed by retrospective interviews with 11 pairs of friends and couples. through the field study, we studied how mim users adopt these two concepts and how the added functions affect their mim behaviors in their natural, in-situ messaging environments. we found that private status sharing lessens the pressure and expectations for immediate response in mim, as their personalized and customized status sharing plays the role of shared understanding of real-time (un)availability. sender-controlled notifications bring the autonomy to the sender to manage their notifications according to the statuses of the receiver’s and their own, consideration of receiver-side interruptions, and concerns on message content exposure to others.",918
The New Reality of Reproducibility: The Role of Data Work in Scientific Research,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392840,"although reproducibility--the idea that a valid scientific experiment can be repeated with similar results--is integral to our understanding of good scientific practice, it has remained a difficult concept to define precisely. across scientific disciplines, the increasing prevalence of large datasets, and the computational techniques necessary to manage and analyze those datasets, has prompted new ways of thinking about reproducibility. we present findings from a qualitative study of a nsf--funded two-week workshop developed to introduce an interdisciplinary group of domain scientists to data-management techniques for data-intensive computing, with a focus on reproducible science. our findings suggest that the introduction of data-related activities promotes a new understanding of reproducibility as a mechanism for local knowledge transfer and collaboration, particularly as regards efficient software reuse. in this paper, we’ve shown how the integration of data-science tools and techniques into the work practices of domain scientists coincides with a reorientation of the concept of reproducibility. as our participants assimilate data-science activities into their work, they begin to understand reproducibility more strongly along a local dimension–as a means to collaborate and facilitate knowledge transfer, via the implementation of state-of-the-art technologies, such as containerization software–and less strongly along a global dimension, associated with abstract values of scientific integrity. our goal here is not to generalize these specific findings to all disciplines in all locales. rather, we use these findings to sensitize the research community to a number of useful approaches to understanding the proliferation of data tools in scientific work. firstly, it suggests a way of examining the reproducibility movement not as a monolithic crisis, but as a highly variegated movement across different research cultures. secondly, while the effort that has been put into constructing analytical distinctions between concepts like replication and reproducibility is valuable, there is also value in following the researchers’ own understandings of reproducibility in practice. as argued by jackson, steinhardt, and buyuktur [31], such meanings are crucial to policy and design of computational tools. finally, we can avoid taking data tools as a neutral substrate for scientific investigation, and instead examine how such tools embody shifting standards of excellence in scientific work. changes in tools have real consequences for the way researchers evidence their findings and evaluate the findings of others, and are at the center of the “culture change” occurring around reproducibility. this observation lends new recognition and new responsibility to the work of research software engineers, technicians, developers, and designers in science. as the availability of large datasets continues to increase, and as the tools and techniques to manage and analyze these datasets become more widely accessible, we can expect that more people in diverse fields and professions will begin to integrate data-related tasks into their pursuits. these other domains of practice are likely to alter around the adoption of data work. in this paper, we provide an illustrative example of how the uptake of data-science activities might affect how people understand the fundamental concepts that inform their work. still, because of the nature of our study, our findings are necessarily localized. while the workshop setting provides a strategic point of observation, it also presents some limitations. extending the study longitudinally, and looking at the use of reproducibility tools in everyday scientific practice, rather than in the educational workshop setting would be valuable. furthermore, as shown by the distinction researchers made in the workshop between acceptable and excessive forms of coding, the kinds of tasks that constitute science are shifting in response to the adoption of data practices. another area of fruitful study might explore the evolving divisions between science and often-sidelined types of technical work, such as research software engineering. finally, there are strong affinities between the concerns of researchers in doing reproducible science and the concerns of the broader software development community in developing software effectively through documentation, adhering to development methods, and avoiding technical debt. these affinities are well worth investigating as further characteristics that distinguish computational reproducibility from broader notions of reproducibility, and as developing connections between scientific software development and industrial cultures of software development.",919
Shifting forms of Engagement: Volunteer Learning in Online Citizen Science,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392841,"peer production projects involve people in many tasks, from editing articles to analyzing datasets. to facilitate mastery of these practices, projects offer a number of learning resources, ranging from project-defined faqsto individually-oriented search tools and communal discussion boards. however, it is not clear which project resources best support participant learning, overall and at different stages of engagement. we draw onsørensen's framework of forms of presence to distinguish three types of engagement with learning resources:authoritative, agent-centered and communal. we assigned resources from the gravity spy citizen-science into these three categories and analyzed trace data recording interactions with resources using a mixed-effects logistic regression with volunteer performance as an outcome variable. the findings suggest that engagement with authoritative resources (e.g., those constructed by project organizers) facilitates performance initially. however, as tasks become more difficult, volunteers seek and benefit from engagement with their own agent-centered resources and community-generated resources. these findings suggest a broader scope for the design of learning resources for peer production. in this article, we investigate the behaviors of volunteers in an online citizen science project. applying sørensen’s theory about forms of presence, we determine how volunteers’ resource engagements change as their relationship to the project changes and the complexity of the task increases. volunteers begin their tenure as citizen scientists relying primarily on authority-subject and communal engagements. as the task difficulty increases, volunteers’ reliance on authoritysubject engagements subsides significantly and other forms of engagements become more central namely agent-centered and communal. these results are buttressed by responses from superusers who provide context to the quantitative findings presented in this article. volunteers emphasized that, as the glitch classification task becomes more challenging, social participation becomes necessary as a form of question asking, learning about the practices of other volunteers, and performing their own analysis to make sense of ambiguous glitch classes. overall, the findings suggests that social participation and independent work can enhance the learning experiences of participants in peer production. project organizers should consider approaches to include communal resources in people’s learning experiences and provide directed instruction for independent work.",920
Stuck in the middle with you: The Transaction Costs of Corporate Employees Hiring Freelancers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392842,"corporations are increasingly empowering employees to hire on-demand workers via freelance platforms. we interviewed full-time employees of a global technology company who hired freelancers as part of their job responsibilities. while there has been prior work describing freelancers' perspectives there has been little research on those that hire them, the ""clients"", especially in the corporate context. we found that while freelance platforms reduce many administrative burdens, there are number of conditions in which using freelance platforms in a corporate context creates high transaction costs and power asymmetries that make it difficult for clients to negotiate work rights and responsibilities. this leads corporate employee clients to feel ""stuck in the middle"" between their employer, the platform, and the freelancer. ultimately, these transactions costs are a potential barrier to wider adoption. if corporations want to leverage the value of the freelance economy then better guardrails, guidelines, and perhaps even creative technology solutions will be needed. the key benefit to clients in using freelancers was to save time, and this time savings came in a variety of ways. first, it came through simply having more people available to work. having access to more brainpower meant more work could get done faster. second, it came through clients using their time more efficiently. for example, clients could hire a freelancer with the skills necessary for the task at hand when the client might not have had those skills themselves. this saved the client the ramp up time of learning new skills, which, in turn, allowed the client to focus their time on the core parts of their job, utilizing the specialized skills they already built up. finally, there was less overhead and faster on-boarding time in hiring a freelancer than using a traditional staffing agency. with these myriad benefits, one might have expected clients to rampantly hire freelancers to improve the speed and efficiency of their business while reducing costs. instead clients moved more cautiously due to their concerns about responsible use and transaction costs like task definition and management overhead. we also saw that clients care about working with freelancers responsibly both in terms of making sure the freelancer is getting a fair deal and in terms of contemplating what the growth of the freelance economy means for themselves and their careers. it is not the case that clients are simply trying to take advantage of labor arbitrage and just get work done cheaper. in fact, some non-managers were explicitly turned off by talk of cost savings. a common use case is for clients to work with freelancers when they need a task done that they do not know how to do themselves. we found that in this case clients do not know how to adequately describe the task, how to set milestones for it, how to vet freelancers who apply, or how to set the payment amount. thus the very reason that brought the client to the freelance platform was a key reason that the outcome was not what the client hoped for and the work output of the freelancer was discarded. often in this case the client blames themselves for this outcome. since clients were unclear as to how much they could manage and how they could manage, they found it difficult to course correct when a project got off track. this, combined with the general amount of overhead clients faced in managing freelancers, only exacerbated the problem of task definition. if the task was not clearly defined from the beginning it was hard to make changes during the course of the project. in order to address these issues, we have made a number of recommendations, all which come back to the issue of responsible use, which was the most prevalent of all of the issues that clients faced. recently the plight of the workers in the on-demand economy has received much attention from the media and academics alike. we agree that workers should have better benefits and more rights. we argue that creating a marketplace with a more equal power dynamic between clients and freelancers would also help freelancers and is not mutually exclusive or at odds with efforts such as unionizing freelancers or changing legislation. companies and platforms have the power to create a more equal power dynamic, and we urge them to take our suggestions into consideration. we also urge the cscw community to broaden its research to further examine the freelance economy and the experiences of clients.",921
Parallel Journeys of Patients with Cancer and Depression: Challenges and Opportunities for Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392843,"depression is common but under-treated in patients with cancer, despite being a major modifiable contributor to morbidity and early mortality. integrating psychosocial care into cancer services through the team-based collaborative care management (cocm) model has been proven to be effective in improving patient outcomes in cancer centers. however, there is currently a gap in understanding the challenges that patients and their care team encounter in managing co-morbid cancer and depression in integrated psycho-oncology care settings. our formative study examines the challenges and needs of cocm in cancer settings with perspectives from patients, care managers, oncologists, psychiatrists, and administrators, with a focus on technology opportunities to support cocm. we find that: (1) patients with co-morbid cancer and depression struggle to navigate between their cancer and psychosocial care journeys, and (2) conceptualizing co-morbidities as separate and independent care journeys is insufficient for characterizing this complex care context. we then propose the parallel journeys framework as a conceptual design framework for characterizing challenges that patients and their care team encounter when cancer and psychosocial care journeys interact. we use the challenges discovered through the lens of this framework to highlight and prioritize technology design opportunities for supporting whole-person care for patients with co-morbid cancer and depression. the integration of psychosocial services in cancer care is crucial in supporting the whole patient, and yet challenges rooted in cancer-centric views continue to prevent patients with cancer and depression from receiving adequate care. we introduce the parallel journeys framework to characterize patient experiences in simultaneously navigating the cancer care journey and the psychosocial care journey. the framework helps reveal challenges at the seams of the two journeys and helps surface related technology opportunities. we encourage health technology researchers, designers, and healthcare providers to consider both cancer care journeys and psychosocial care journeys in their future design of technologies for patients with cancer and depression.",922
Real-Time Interruption Management System for Efficient Distributed Collaboration in Multi-tasking Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392844,"interruption dissemination in proactive systems remains a challenge for efficient human-machine collaboration, especially in real-time distributed collaborative environments. in this paper a real-time interruption management system (ims) is proposed that leverages speech information, the most commonly used and available means of communication within collaborative distributed environments. the key aspect of this paper includes a proposed real-time ims system that leverages lexical affirmation cues to infer the end of a task or task boundary as a candidate interruption time. the performance results show the proposed real-time lexical affirmation cues based interruption management system (ace-ims) outperforms the current baseline real-time ims system within the existing literature. ace-ims has the potential of reducing disruptive interruptions without incurring excessive missed opportunities to disseminate interruptions by utilizing only the most frequently used mode of human communication: voice. thereby, providing a promising new baseline to further the system development of real-time interruption management systems within the ever-growing distributed collaborative domain. ill-timed interruptions disrupt the ongoing task and degrade human productivity and affective state, which poses a serious threat, especially in distributed multi-user multi–tasking interactions. to address this challenge, this paper proposed ace-ims, an adaptive and real-time interruption management system that utilizes typical affirmation cues present in human-human communication to construct a highly effective and efficient solution for disseminating interruptions at task-boundary. this work, motivated by the observation that affirmation cues are present in majority of task-boundary utterances in task–oriented dialogues, demonstrated that affirmation cues can be leveraged in a real-time ims to effectively control and disseminate interruptions in order to mitigate the challenges imposed by disruptive interruptions. the proposed solution has the potential to improve the effort in growing field of computer-supported distributed collaborations that strive to augment human cognitive capability with computational and sensory power of machines, while suppressing the risk of cognitive overload. thus, the resulting cooperative teaming between humans and machines paves way for a new wave of human-machine teaming applications in stressful distributed multi-tasking environments, such as: emergency and disaster management, law enforcement, telemedicine, and other field operations.",923
Conformity of Eating Disorders through Content Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392845,"for individuals with mental illness, social media platforms are considered spaces for sharing and connection. however, not all expressions of mental illness are treated equally on these platforms. different aggregates of human and technical control are used to report and ban content, accounts, and communities. through two years of digital ethnography, including online observation and interviews, with people with eating disorders, we examine the experience of content moderation. we use a constructivist grounded theory approach to analysis that shows how practices of moderation across different platforms have particular consequences for members of marginalized groups, who are pressured to conform and compelled to resist. above all, we argue that platform moderation is enmeshed with wider processes of conformity to specific versions of mental illness. practices of moderation reassert certain bodies and experiences as 'normal' and valued, while rejecting others. at the same time, navigating and resisting these normative pressures further inscribes the marginal status of certain individuals. we discuss changes to the ways that platforms handle content related to eating disorders by drawing on the concept of multiplicity to inform design. practices of content moderation are integral to what social media platforms do. however, they are far from perfect and increasingly difficult to get right. despite good intentions, practices of moderation have consequences for individuals with eating disorders and other members of marginalized groups. these consequences include loss of personal content and community support and labor associated with practices of resistance. in this paper, we examine the experience of content moderation and how, in particular, mechanisms of content moderation (e.g., the sociotechnical relations involved in content removal, quarantine, helpline resources) work to establish and enforce a conformity to body image and body management on social media. we argue that processes of conformity as reproduced through sociotechnical structures afforded by platforms work to exclude people with eating disorders and other non-normative identities and experiences. additionally, our work raises the question of who or what gets to decide which experiences and narratives are acceptable for online participation. rather than design for restrictive content moderation practices, we suggest that platforms consider supporting a diversity of eating disorder and illness experiences by designing for multiplicity.",924
Do Multilingual Users Prefer Chat-bots that Code-mix? Let's Nudge and Find Out!,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392846,"despite their pervasiveness, current text-based conversational agents (chatbots) are predominantly monolingual, while users are often multilingual. it is well-known that multilingual users mix languages while interacting with others, as well as in their interactions with computer systems (such as query formulation in text-/voice-based search interfaces and digital assistants). linguists refer to this phenomenon as code-mixing or code-switching. do multilingual users also prefer chatbots that can respond in a code-mixed language over those which cannot? in order to inform the design of chatbots for multilingual users, we conduct a mixed-method user-study (n=91) where we examine how conversational agents, that code-mix and reciprocate the users' mixing choices over multiple conversation turns, are evaluated and perceived by bilingual users. we design a human-in-the-loop chatbot with two different code-mixing policies -- (a) always code-mix irrespective of user behavior, and (b) nudge with subtle code-mixed cues and reciprocate only if the user, in turn, code-mixes. these two are contrasted with a monolingual chatbot that never code-mixed. users are asked to interact with the bots, and provide ratings on perceived naturalness and personal preference. they are also asked open-ended questions around what they (dis)liked about the bots. analysis of the chat logs, users' ratings, and qualitative responses reveal that multilingual users strongly prefer chatbots that can code-mix. we find that self-reported language proficiency is the strongest predictor of user preferences. compared to the always code-mix policy, nudging emerges as a low-risk low-gain policy which is equally acceptable to all users. nudging as a policy is further supported by the observation that users who rate the code-mixing bot higher typically tend to reciprocate the language mixing pattern of the bot. these findings present a first step towards developing conversational systems that are more human-like and engaging by virtue of adapting to the users' linguistic style. our key findings are that systems that explicitly reason about the extent of code-mixing in their replies, independent of content, fare better in terms of user evaluations with bilingual users. through a mixed-method user study, we comprehensively analyze the effects of user demographics, expressed attitudes, and language proficiency on evaluations of cm chatbots. our contributions include a new syntactic schema for sentence-level code-mixing, and an online policy formulation to gradually incorporate any graded style dimension into a conversation based on mutual reciprocation. we also emphasize the utility of adaptively estimating hidden user preferences in cases where they are not known a priori, using insights from work on communication accommodation theory. finally, demonstrate the utility of incorporating linguistic style into dialog planning, through the proposed strategy of ‘nudging’. we thus present a step towards developing more responsive, natural and human-like conversational systems that move beyond just considerations of content and take into account the linguistic style choices of users.",925
Moving Across Lands: Online Platform Migration in Fandom Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392847,"when online platforms rise and fall, sometimes communities fade away, and sometimes they pack their bags and relocate to a new home. to explore the causes and effects of online community migration, we examine transformative fandom, a longstanding, technology-agnostic community surrounding the creation, sharing, and discussion of creative works based on existing media. for over three decades, community members have left and joined many different online spaces, from usenet to tumblr to platforms of their own design. through analysis of 28 in-depth interviews and 1,886 survey responses from fandom participants, we traced these migrations, the reasons behind them, and their impact on the community. our findings highlight catalysts for migration that provide insights into factors that contribute to success and failure of platforms, including issues surrounding policy, design, and community. further insights into the disruptive consequences of migrations (such as social fragmentation and lost content) suggest ways that platforms might both support commitment and better support migration when it occurs. as our digital communities grow more and more complex, we should try to better understand what connects an online community beyond the platform where it is embodied. communities rarely emerge in a vacuum, carrying with them a history of previous relationships and community memberships [53]. fandom is a unique domain with which to study this phenomenon, since the community has existed across so many different online spaces over a very long period of time, demonstrating how communities can exist separate from and across platforms simultaneously, and ultimately survive beyond them. our findings about platform migration suggest common motivations for leaving as well as joining, and suggest that policy and values based problems can be particularly important, but that these alone may not be enough to inspire a mass exodus. just as a “new and sparkly” alternative can draw people away from a platform that is serving them well, that same viable alternative must be available to draw them in. subsequently, the network effects that occur when users follow their friends and communities (or flee empty shopping malls) can lead to a new platform becoming a home. why don’t people just leave facebook, in the wake of so many complaints about it? the same reason fans don’t just leave tumblr. they need somewhere to go first, and that place must importantly support both their technical and their community needs. in other words, without a good enough place to go, migration becomes a collective action problem. one of the lessons of this work is how one might make that alternative good enough, an accounting for what factors contribute to viable alternatives and successful migrations, as illustrated by data about thousands of individual moves across platforms. these findings have the potential to assist platform designers in mitigating the challenges of users leaving and joining new platforms. moving across lands need not stymie creativity and fracture communities if we build better paths to travel on.",926

Trustworthiness Perceptions of Social Media Resources Named after a Crisis Event,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392849,"people often create social media accounts and pages named after crisis events. we call such accounts and pages crisis named resources (cnrs). cnrs share information about crisis events and are followed by many. yet, they also appear suddenly (at crisis onset) and in most cases, the owners are unknown. thus, it can be challenging for audiences in particular to know whether to trust (or not trust) these cnrs and the information they provide. in this study, we conducted surveys and interviews with members of the public and experts in crisis informatics, emergency response, and communication studies to evaluate the trustworthiness of cnrs named after the 2017 hurricane irma. findings showed that participants evaluated trustworthiness based on their perceptions of a cnr's content, information source, profile, and owner. findings also show that if people perceive that a cnr owner has prior experience in crisis response, can help the public to respond to the event, understands the situation, has the best interests of affected individuals in mind, or will correct misinformation, they tend to trust that cnr. participant demographics and expertise showed no effect on perceptions of trustworthiness. this study showed that factors that influence the perceived trustworthiness of cnrs fall under the broad categories of cnr content, information source, profile, and owner. we found that participants tended to consider a cnr trustworthy if they perceive its content as relevant, of high quality, adequate in quantity, timely, useful, and accurate, and if it contained media. participants also trusted cnrs that either linked to authoritative and/or local sources or mentioned their information sources. additionally, participants considered a cnr trustworthy if they perceived it to be professional, popular, authentic, and with a crisis-related purpose. lastly, participants tended to trust cnrs if they perceived that its owners could help or had good intentions for crisis-affected individuals. this research also determines how people assess the trustworthiness of cnrs. findings of this research show that if people perceive that a cnr owner has prior experience in crisis response, can help crisis-affected public to respond to the event, understands the situation, has the best interests of affected individuals in mind, or will correct misinformation that comes into his/her notice, they tend to trust that cnr. in contrast, if people feel that a cnr owner might share misinformation intentionally, they tend not to trust that cnr. no significant correlation between participants perceptions on the trustworthiness of cnrs and their demographics was found.",928
ImageSense: An Intelligent Collaborative Ideation Tool to Support Diverse Human-Computer Partnerships,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392850,"professional designers create mood boards to explore, visualize, and communicate hard-to-express ideas. we present imagecascade, an intelligent, collaborative ideation tool that combines individual and shared work spaces, as well as collaboration with multiple forms of intelligent agents. in the collection phase, imagecascade offers fluid transitions between serendipitous discovery of curated images via imagecascade, combined text- and image-based semantic search, and intelligent ai suggestions for finding new images. for later composition and reflection, imagecascade provides semantic labels, generated color palettes, and multiple tag clouds to help communicate the intent of the mood board. a study of nine professional designers revealed nuances in designers' preferences for designer-led, system-led, and mixed-initiative approaches that evolve throughout the design process. we discuss the challenges in creating effective human-computer partnerships for creative activities, and suggest directions for future research. we presented imagesense, a collaborative, digital mood board design tool that supports collaboration between remote designers and offers intelligent tools for: serendipitous discovery of curated images from the imagecascade, combined text- and image-based semantic search, and intelligent ai suggestions to find new images. our goal is to support human-computer partnership, allowing designers to share agency both with each other and with intelligent tools, creating diverse forms of collaboration that remain under the user’s control. imagesense uses state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to provide active intelligent agents that contribute and adapt to the ideation process, under the designer’s control. by enriching images with semantic labels, imagesense facilitates both semantic visual search and reflection, and provides opportunities for serendipitous exploration. our research questions were to rq1) explore new ways to seamlessly integrate contributions from both human and intelligent agents into a digital mood board; rq2) identify the appropriate kinds of intelligent assistance for different types of ideation challenges; and rq3) assess some of the differences in how designers interact with remote human collaborators and intelligent assistants, and how they can support each other. we addressed the first goal by creating a digital mood board tool that supports the entire ideation process, from early collection of ideas, to layout of visual material, to reflection and final presentation to stakeholders. the system is fully collaborative: remote designers can work together in a shared space, but each retain their own individual spaces and access to design tools. they can see each other’s work progress, and propose and react to the remote designer’s images and reactions to their choices. imagesense also incorporates three visual inspiration tools, each with a different type of agency. designers control when to propose or seek suggestions or reactions, from both their human partners and intelligent agents. designers can use these different tools without disrupting their creative flow. most designers (8/9) reported that imagesense helped them explore novel alternatives and to effectively communicate their designs to stakeholders. they also reported that imagesense helped them reflect on both the composition and traceability of the process. most agreed that imagesense helped them to ‘collect useful images’ (6/9) and ‘be more creative’ (5/9). to address the second and third research goals, our study identified situations under which participants preferred to work with a human designer or with each type of tool. most designers said they would ‘love to own’ imagecascade and semantic search when they were actively collecting images. imagecascade was most useful when they needed to extend their ideas with images that are not directly related, but also not random. they particularly appreciated semantic search when they struggled to find search terms for hard-to-express visual ideas. designers rated the ai suggestions as most suitable when they felt stuck or as an additional push to get started and extend their idea space, ignored it when they were browsing images with imagecascade, or actively searching for images with semantic search. by contrast, designers found the human collaborator particularly helpful when they knew what they were looking for and for discussing content representation in the end. in each case, designers enjoyed being able to choose, minute-by-minute, the types of interactions they had with both human design partners and intelligent assistants. when we consider how best to integrate intelligent systems into any creative process, we need to consider just what it means for the user to remain in control of the interaction. clearly, this does not have a single answer, but depends greatly on the user’s situation in the moment. when designers have a clear idea of what they want and how to express it, they require different types of interaction with intelligent tools than if they are completely at a loss and need surprising, but relevant new ideas. imagesense demonstrates how to integrate different forms of intelligent assistance to create varied human-computer partnerships within the same collaborative, creativity support platform, and, we hope, serves as inspiration for future creativity support tools.",929
"Exploring Photography in Rural Kenyan Households: Considering ""Relational Objects"" in CSCW and HCI",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392852,"domestic and personal photography are topics of longstanding interest to cscw and hci researchers. in this paper, we explore these topics in bungoma county, kenya. we used interview and observation methods to investigate how photographs are taken, displayed, organized, and shared, in 23 rural households. to more deeply understand participants' photography practices, we also gave them digital cameras, observed what they did with them, and asked them to engage in a photo-elicitation exercise. our findings draw attention to the ways photographs are ""relational objects"" - that is, material objects that support the maintenance, reproduction, and transformation of social relations. we then describe these relations: economic (i.e., working as cameramen producing and distributing printed images); family (i.e., parents and children using printed images to tell family histories); and community (i.e., people using printed images to present an idealized self). the introduction of digital cameras into these households did not appear to change these practices; instead, it reinforced them. we discuss how considering relational objects in cscw/hci is useful for balancing the technologically determinist perspectives that are the basis of many prior studies of photography in these fields. in particular, we detail how considering the concept provides new perspectives on materiality, as well an alternative to the individualistic perspective, which underlies these communities' understanding of photography. we present a novel case study exploring how photographs are taken, organized, displayed, and shared in rural households in bungoma county, kenya. our findings demonstrate the value of studying photographic practices across cultures, in particular for drawing attention to relational objects—a topic that merits more consideration in cscw/hci. our research demonstrates the value of introducing new concepts into the cscw/hci communities—in particular, our use of relational objects to frame our research. this concept is considered useful for understanding photographic practices in non-western settings. more broadly, our research draws attention to the variations in technology use that have not been fully considered in prior research. we encourage cscw/hci researchers to be receptive to unexpected ideas (e.g., the continued significance of printed images) and to different cultural norms (e.g., prioritizing relational practices over individualized ones). this means avoiding generalizing perspectives about personal and domestic photography practices—which can lean towards technological determinism—and considering situated perspectives which can emerge from studying these practices in rural kenya.",930
Emotional Amplification During Live-Streaming: Evidence from Comments During and After News Events,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392853,"live streaming services allow people to concurrently consume and comment on media events with other people in real time. durkheim's theory of ""collective effervescence"" suggests that face-to-face encounters in ritual events conjure emotional arousal, so people often feel happier and more excited while watching events like the super bowl with family and friends through the television than if they were alone. does a stronger emotional intensity also occur in live streaming? using a large-scale dataset of comments posted to news and media events on youtube, we address this question by examining emotional intensity in live comments versus those produced retrospectively. results reveal that live comments are overall more emotionally intense than retrospective comments across all temporal periods and all event types examined. findings support the emotional amplification hypothesis and provide preliminary evidence for shared attention theory in explaining the amplification effect. these findings have important implications for live streaming platforms to optimize resources for content moderation and to improve psychological well-being for content moderators, and more broadly as society grapples with using technology to stay connected during social distancing required by the covid-19 pandemic. live streaming fosters co-presence and social interaction in everyday viewing practices, creating a mediated co-viewing experience. our work, using an observational analysis of large-scale text data, reveals that emotions experienced together with others during live streaming are more intense than emotions experienced individually after the live streaming. this emotional amplification effect is consistent across media events and time points. this effect is best explained by perceptual absorption as people process live media as predicted by shared attention theory. our findings reveal emotional dynamics during and after live streaming, and highlight the urgency of further improving the live streaming platforms to strategically perform content moderation and improve the well-being for moderators. as the pandemic of covid-19, which began in early 2020, and the practice of social distancing has made clear, understanding the emotional dynamics of live streaming as a practice for staying connected via technology is increasingly important.",931
Measuring Misinformation in Video Search Platforms: An Audit Study on YouTube,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392854,"search engines are the primary gateways of information. yet, they do not take into account the credibility of search results. there is a growing concern that youtube, the second largest search engine and the most popular video-sharing platform, has been promoting and recommending misinformative content for certain search topics. in this study, we audit youtube to verify those claims. our audit experiments investigate whether personalization (based on age, gender, geolocation, or watch history) contributes to amplifying misinformation. after shortlisting five popular topics known to contain misinformative content and compiling associated search queries representing them, we conduct two sets of audits-search-and watch-misinformative audits. our audits resulted in a dataset of more than 56k videos compiled to link stance (whether promoting misinformation or not) with the personalization attribute audited. our videos correspond to three major youtube components: search results, up-next, and top 5 recommendations. we find that demographics, such as, gender, age, and geolocation do not have a significant effect on amplifying misinformation in returned search results for users with brand new accounts. on the other hand, once a user develops a watch history, these attributes do affect the extent of misinformation recommended to them. further analyses reveal a filter bubble effect, both in the top 5 and up-next recommendations for all topics, except vaccine controversies; for these topics, watching videos that promote misinformation leads to more misinformative video recommendations. in conclusion, youtube still has a long way to go to mitigate misinformation on its platform. in this study, we conducted two sets of audit experiments on youtube platform to empirically determine the effect of personalization attributes (age, gender, geolocation and watch history) on the amount of misinformation prevalent in youtube searches and recommendations. our audits resulted in a dataset of 56,475 videos that we annotated for their stance (promoting, neutral and debunking) and relevance towards the misinformative search topics. we found that the personalization attributes affect the amount of misinformation in recommendations once the user develops a watch history. our study also suggests that youtube is modifying its search and recommendation algorithm for certain misinformative topics like vaccine controversies. our audit methodologies can be used for investigating other search engines for misinformative search results and recommendations. we believe such audit studies will inform the need for building search engines that retrieve and present results ranked according to both relevance and credibility.",932
"""(We) Can Talk It Out..."": Designing for Promoting Conflict-Resolution Skills in Youth on a Moderated Minecraft Server",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392855,"online multiplayer games like minecraft, gaining increasing popularity among present-day youth, include rich contexts for social interactions but are also rife with interpersonal conflict among players. research shows that a variety of socio-technical mechanisms (e.g., server rules, chat filters, use of in-game controls to ban players, etc.) aim to limit and/or eliminate social conflict in games like minecraft. however, avoiding social conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach. broadly defined in cscw literature as a phenomenon that may arise even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g., [easterbrook et al.,1993]). in fact, the aforementioned approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal differences that may occur in other social settings. furthermore, prior research has established the value of developing conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention interventions (e.g.,[shure, 1982], [aber et al., 1998]), for later success in any given interpersonal relationship. while games like minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions within online interest-driven settings. drawing from prior literature in cscw, youth wellness and prevention programs, we translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated minecraft server. the online program, titled survival lab, was designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). we conducted a field study for six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators, and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. our study data reveals that participating youth created community norms and developed insightful solutions to conflicts in survival lab. our research offers three key takeaways. firstly, online social games like minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social competencies among youth. secondly, the design features that support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are viable for collective or community-level outcomes. third and finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play a vital role in facilitating the development of conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among youth. we discuss the implications of our research for translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites and conclude with recommendations for future work. youth are increasingly engaging in online social activities that including playing games like social minecraft. research shows that current approaches in games like minecraft avoid or eliminate social conflict to suppress deviant group behaviors. however, youth need opportunities to practice and grow their ability to solve social conflict within safe contexts so they can overcome interpersonal problems and better understand how to cooperate with others. research in cscw offers a wealth of knowledge on conflict resolution that is an inherent part of any collaboration and everyday social interactions. adjacent disciplines in youth wellness, positive psychology, and prevention science programs offer a rich evidence-base for alternative design strategies known to work in offline/in-person settings. building on cscw research, our work explores an alternative view of social conflict (i.e. that can occur whether or not mutual cooperation exists) within an online multiplayer game for youth. we translated offline evidence-based strategies into an online afterschool program that was run within a moderated minecraft server. the program was designed to maximize social conflict and individual agency for youth (ages 8-14 years). to our surprise, our analysis of data from a six month field study (30 youth participants, 4 college-age moderators, and 1 high-school community volunteer) revealed that youth not only engaged with the program’s design features to problem-solve conflicts they experienced, but also drew on community norms that youth themselves had authored in survival lab. our traces’ data revealed only three major conflicts over a six-month time period, all of which were resolved through discussion in an amicable manner. while further research is necessary to formally evaluate our design, our work in this paper offers the promise for designers, researchers, and practitioners to expand contexts in minecraft aimed at promoting pro-social development in youth. our research suggests that online play-based settings can be viable sites to rapidly and iteratively build, evaluate and scale behavioral interventions for youth, thereby addressing some of the challenges faced by traditional offline interventions.",933
Successful Online Socialization: Lessons from the Wikipedia Education Program,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392857,"attracting and retaining newcomers is critical and challenging for online production communities such as wikipedia, both because volunteers need specialized training and are likely to leave before being integrated into the community. in response to these challenges, the wikimedia foundation started the wiki education project (wiki ed), an online program in which college students edit wikipedia articles as class assignments. the wiki ed program incorporates many components of institutional socialization, a process many conventional organizations successfully use to integrate new employees through formalized on-boarding practices. research has not adequately investigated whether wiki ed and similar programs are effective ways to integrate volunteers in online communities, and, if so, the mechanisms involved. this paper evaluates the wiki ed program by comparing 16,819 student editors in 770 wiki ed classes with new editors who joined wikipedia in the conventional way. the evaluation shows that the wiki ed students did more work, improved articles more, and were more committed to wikipedia. for example, compared to new editors who joined wikipedia in the conventional way they were twice as likely to still be editing wikipedia a year after their wiki ed class was finished. further, students in classrooms that encouraged joint activity, a key component of institutional socialization, produced better quality work than those in classrooms where students worked independently. these findings are consistent with an interpretation that the wiki ed program was successful because it incorporated elements of institutionalized socialization.",934
C-Reference: Improving 2D to 3D Object Pose Estimation Accuracy via Crowdsourced Joint Object Estimation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392858,"converting widely-available 2d images and videos, captured using an rgb camera, to 3d can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. however, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only accurately estimating object location and orientation, but also requires knowing currently unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). a scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3d object properties. unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3d properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3d perception (i.e., humans do not ""see"" depth like a laser range finder). in this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3d state of a single target object. our approach can generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding various different objects that share a spatial relationship with the target object. we evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that our method can reduce errors in the target object's 3d location estimation by over 40%, while requiring only $35$% as much human time. our work introduces a novel way to enable groups of people with different perspectives and knowledge to achieve more accurate collective performance on challenging visual annotation tasks. this paper presents the design, implementation and assessment of c-reference, a system that collects heterogeneous annotations of various different objects and jointly aggregates such annotations to accurately estimate the 3d location of a target object in a 2d image. through a controlled characterization study, we investigated the potential performance benefit of our joint object annotation aggregation method that harnesses c-reference. based on the study results, we implemented a system, c-reference, that collects diverse object measurement approximations from crowd workers. using our proposed method, the annotations from crowd workers could be transformed into a soft constraint for an optimizer, penalizing infeasible solutions and encouraging the optimizer to find a better solution based on the collective annotations. our results show that c-reference’s improves the quality of 3d location estimation of objects by more than 40% while requiring only 35% as much human time. more broadly, our work proposes a new approach to leveraging contextually relevant information from different objects to more accurately compute target object estimation.",935
Data Analysts and Their Software Practices: A Profile of the Sabermetrics Community and Beyond,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392859,"for modern data analytics, practices from software development are increasingly necessary to manage data, but they must be incorporated alongside other statistical and scientific skills. therefore, we ask: how does a community recontextualize software development through the unique pressures of their work? to answer this, we explore the analytic community around baseball, or sabermetrics. to discover software development's place in the search for robust statistical insight in sports, we interview 10 participants in the sabermetric community and survey over 120 more data analysts, both in baseball and not. we explore how their work lives at the intersection of science and entertainment, and as a consequence, baseball data serves as an accessible yet deep subject to practice analytic skills. software development exists within an iterative research process that cycles between defining rigorous statistical methods and preserving the flexibility to chase interesting problems. in this question-driven process, members of the community inhabit several overlapping roles of intentional work, in which software development can become the priority to support research and statistical infrastructure, and we discuss the way that the community can foster the balance of these skills. in this study, we explored a community of data analysts and their work at the intersection of analytics and software development. we chose baseball analytics as our subject because of its unique positioning as a cultural, historical, and academic field: with more than a century of public interest and development, it offers extensive datasets with expansive and passionate conversation around it. in order to supplement theories of what development work looks like, we conducted interviews and surveys that inquired about participants’ individual practices in developing software to fulfill their goals. our results emphasize the diverse nature of a community defined more by a shared interest than a uniform approach to analytic or development work. though the responsibilities of a sabermetrician support general analysis by definition, it constitutes a number of specializations—in development and data curation, for example—that allow for different academic backgrounds and interests to apply new frames for work. whatever the case, the differences between individuals is mitigated by what sabermetricians share: a passion for the sport of baseball and its statistical language, extensive historical datasets, and physical and virtual communities where hobbyists and professionals alike can support or debate research. these resources make it possible for analysts, for baseball and in general, to practice skills productively through personal projects and to find supportive peers or communities. we also find that the analytic posture has definite effects on the software development cycle: analysts must balance flexibility in finding interesting questions while nevertheless being rigorous with the scientific method in responsibly carrying through from data to insight. still, there remains work in overcoming barriers in construction and testing that result, in part, from a lack of shared community practice. therefore, as researchers and practitioners continue to develop better interdisciplinary resources, we acknowledge the potential in this community to capitalize on its particular position between science and entertainment as it continues to evolve.",936
Topical Focus of Political Campaigns and its Impact: Findings from Politicians' Hashtag Use during the 2019 Indian Elections,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392860,"we studied the topical preferences of social media campaigns of india's two main political parties by examining the tweets of 7382 politicians during the key phase of campaigning between jan - may of 2019 in the run up to the 2019 general election. first, we compare the use of self-promotion and opponent attack, and their respective success online by categorizing 1208 most commonly used hashtags accordingly into the two categories. second, we classify the tweets applying a qualitative typology to hashtags on the subjects of nationalism, corruption, religion and development. we find that the ruling bjp tended to promote itself over attacking the opposition whereas the main challenger inc was more likely to attack than promote itself. moreover, while the inc gets more retweets on average, the bjp dominates twitter's trends by flooding the online space with large numbers of tweets. we consider the implications of our findings hold for political communication strategies in democracies across the world. in conclusion, this research shows empirically what has often been argued anecdotally by commentators, that the election has seen a nationalistic shift by the bjp. it is important to situate this within the larger context of indian politics in the last decade, since the bjp came to power eschewing its traditional right-wing hindu-politics narrative and instead focusing on development and anti-corruption. as a party in power, attempting to defend itself, the turn to nationalism as well as religion underlines the party’s recognition of emotional sectarian appeals as valuable at the votebanks. while there are nuances specific to indian politics, the case of an incumbent, being attacked on corruption and development, turning to nationalistic and sectarian politics holds warnings for political movements worldwide. the successes in this lean towards a political enemy, rather than a policy offering, are portentous in an international political environment in which nation states increasingly see heightening amounts of polarization.",937
Toward a Grassroots Culture of Technology Practice,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392862,"information and communication technologies (icts) can support grassroots social movements toward greateroutreach and better day-to-day communication. in this paper, we present the results of action research with alarge-scale grassroots social movement, the southern movement assembly (sma), exploring their uses andperceptions of icts. we find that the icts chosen by the sma are often at odds with their grassroots cultureof inclusion and participation-which results in inequitable sociotechnical realities within the movement. forexample, people with technical skills gain more power as they start to control organizational processes. astechnical skills are most commonly associated with racial, gender, and socioeconomic privileges, this leads toinequitable participation. we conclude by calling for a grassroots culture of technology practice rooted inanalyses of systemic exclusion with a continuous effort to center the marginalized voices and experienceswith technology. imagine telling a grassroots organizer thirty years ago that in the future they would have low-cost or even free access to audio and video conferencing, shared document editing, and the means to publicize events to thousands of people with a few mouse clicks. they would, rightly, be amazed and excited. the existence of these technologies is what makes a regional movement like sma possible. technology has come a long way toward helping the voices of people be heard. however, these technologies also have unexpected consequences. it doesn’t much help to have a meeting via audio conferencing so people without computers can attend if the meeting is announced via email. small barriers like this accumulate, making true democracy hard to achieve. even grassroots organizations who rank democratic participation of the marginalized as a top value struggle to be fully inclusive in their daily practices. awareness of the problem is an important first step, but not a sufficient one, since careful analysis of available technological tools often leads to hard trade offs. we suggest that there is work to be done in cscw and broader hci toward critically examining both the fundamental values we produce and market our technologies with as well as the consequences of such value-laden technologies. as a possible shift in the means of ict design and production, we suggest cscw and hci designers draw from the culture (practices, beliefs, artifacts described throughout this paper) of grassroots inclusivity—a vision of inclusivity grounded in a structural analysis of exclusion. while we envision a more integrated technology practice in cscw (and therefore more value-aligned icts) that accommodates grassroots needs, we argue that grassroots movements too have a role to play in making such an integration happen. thus, we call for a localized culture of technology practice in grassroots communities that is committed to holding the cultures of ict accountable for the values they embody and promote. we envision that a grassroots culture of technology practice will be rooted in the grassroots analysis of systemic exclusion with a continuous effort to include and center the marginalized voices and experiences with technology. in future work, we are doing sociotechnical systems design (both artifacts and social practices) toward that culture of technology, prioritizing grassroots inclusivity and other grassroots values. further, our ongoing work with sma also aims to create a handbook of movement communications, which we hope will be useful to other groups who would like to reflect on their own practices. ultimately, with our ongoing and future work in cscw and in grassroots communities, we remain committed to help facilitate a grassroots culture of technology practice.",938
Quantifying the Effect of Social Presence on Online Social Conformity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392863,"social conformity occurs when individuals in group settings change their personal opinion to be in agreement with the majority's position. while recent literature frequently reports on conformity in online group settings, the causes for online conformity are yet to be fully understood. this study aims to understand how social presencei.e., the sense of being connected to others via mediated communication, influences conformity among individuals placed in online groups while answering subjective and objective questions. acknowledging its multifaceted nature, we investigate three aspects of online social presence: user representation (generic vs.user-specific avatars), interactivity (discussion vs.no discussion ), and response visibility (public vs.private ). our results show an overall conformity rate of 30% and main effects from task objectivity, group size difference between the majority and the minority, and self-confidence on personal answer. furthermore, we observe an interaction effect between interactivity and response visibility, such that conformity is highest in the presence of peer discussion and public responses, and lowest when these two elements are absent. we conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings in designing online group settings, accounting for the effects of social presence on conformity. recent literature on conformity has given a significant emphasis to its diverse manifestations in online settings [6, 43, 44, 56, 60, 67–69]. however, limited effort has been invested in understanding what triggers conformity in online settings. therefore, this study investigated the effect of social presence (i.e., the awareness of and the sense of being connected to others via mediated communication [58]) on online conformity, while also accounting for the effects of majority group size, task objectivity, and self-confidence – well-known determinants of offline conformity. we manipulated the social presence facilitated by our study setup across three variables – user representation, interactivity, and response visibility – to investigate their combined effect on social conformity. our results reveal that in addition to the expected effects from group size difference, task objectivity, and self-confidence, the interaction among certain aspects of social presence also play a vital role on online conformity behaviour. we note that higher levels of online social presence (in terms of interactivity and response visibility) heightens the susceptibility of users to normative influences in addition to the commonly observed informational influences, leading to higher conformity in online settings. we conclude with a discussion on what our findings imply for the design of online group settings. first, we emphasise that social presence can indeed be used to control conformity influences in online settings. second, our results suggest that platform designers can manipulate the level of interactivity facilitated and the visibility of user actions to manage online social presence, which in turn could help regulate conformity influences. thus, designers should pay special attention to the above aspects of social presence in order to encourage and shape user behaviour as desired in a given setting. we also highlight that the ‘correct’ level of social presence varies based on the requirement of the platform and thus should be determined after careful consideration of its pros and cons. moreover, our findings emphasise that online users prefer user representations that can provide more user-specific information. however, as a substantial amount of literature investigating online user representations and stereotyping recommends otherwise [35, 36, 67], we suggest alternatives that provide a compromise between stronger user cues and stereotypical conformity. we encourage future work to investigate effects of other dimensions and variables of social presence, such as social context and communication style [62], on online conformity that can expand upon these implications.",939
Mitigating Exploitation: Indie Game Developers' Reconfigurations of Labor in Technology,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392864,"much hci research seeks to contribute to technological agendas that lead to more just and participative labor relations and practices, yet that research also raises concerns about forms of exploitation associated with them. in this paper, we explore how u.s. independent [indie] game developers' socio-technological practices inject forms of labor, capital, and production into the game development industry. our findings highlight that indie game development 1) seeks to promote an alternative to business models of game development that depend on free and immaterial labor; 2) builds offline networks at different scales to develop collectives that can sustain their production; and 3) emphasizes how distributed collaboration, co-creation, and the use of free tools and middleware make game production more widely accessible. the research contributes to hci research that seeks to explicate and mitigate emerging forms of exploitation enabled by new technologies and processes. our critical review of indie developers' practices and strategies also extends the current conceptualization of labor and technology in cscw. how can hci address the tension between the increasing demand for more just and participative labor relations and practices and emerging forms of exploitation enabled by new technologies and processes? we have investigated u.s. indie game developers’ socio-technological practices regarding labor, capital, and production as an empirical basis for such discussions. despite its niche technological stance, we see this community as a valuable sociotechnical instance that contributes to hci studies on technology, work, and labor. its mechanisms of free and immaterial labor, distributed collaboration, co-creation, collective visibility and innovation, newcomer-friendliness culture, and the identity as part of a counter movement against sexism in the gaming culture offer promising strategies to mitigate potential risks of exploitation of labor in technology. while acknowledging indie game developers’ aspirations, endeavors, and promising insights for designing for protecting labor, we highlight how studying and criticizing the indie community’s view of labor and technology contributes to extending the current conceptualization of technology and labor in cscw. we, therefore, believe that these insights worth recognition and replication in other communities seeking more just and participative labor relations and practices supported by emerging technologies. we also believe that these insights contribute to an emerging research agenda in cscw. such an agenda would especially focus on how the organization of work and labor significantly impacts what new technologies and processes we can build and produce, especially with regards to how funding, power structure, production models, and work atmosphere are constantly shaping our technological innovation.",940
Unpacking Sharing in the Peer-to-Peer Economy: The Impact of Shared Needs and Backgrounds on Ride-Sharing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392865,"in recent years, the peer-to-peer economy has grown exponentially, particularly in the ride-sharing sector. this growth has been accompanied by a muddying between the sharing and gig economy, and it has become unclear when an activity is sharing a resource vs. providing a service. to unpack this difference, we studied two successful carpooling groups (university students traveling home and commuting among professionals), which we contrast with previous literature on ride-hailing apps (e.g., uber). the two communities that we studied differ in that: professionals, had more routine ride-sharing needs based on their commute; and students, arranged rides to return home for school breaks or long weekends. we detail how common needs and backgrounds impacted how carpoolers treated each other. leveraging these findings, we outline design paths for both the sharing and gig economies to better realize the ideas of the sharing economy.",941
How We've Taught Algorithms to See Identity: Constructing Race and Gender in Image Databases for Facial Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392866,"race and gender have long sociopolitical histories of classification in technical infrastructures-from the passport to social media. facial analysis technologies are particularly pertinent to understanding how identity is operationalized in new technical systems. what facial analysis technologies can do is determined by the data available to train and evaluate them with. in this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. we found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. we discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. we posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. we conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications. emerging research in the realm of fate (fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics) has yielded unique insights in improving equity in facial analysis technologies. specifically, researchers have called for increased engagement with critical scholarship [64] and complex realities of identity [18, 150]. our study embraces these calls, adopting a critical sociohistorical perspective of race and gender classification to analyze current identity documentation practices in image databases. we examined (1) for what purposes are race and gender included in image databases; (2) what information about race and gender is implicit and what is explicit; (3) what sources are being used to define categories of race and gender; and (4) what annotation practices are being used to identify race and gender in images. to accomplish this, we analyzed 92 image databases popularly cited in facial analysis literature. we developed a codebook to examine how database authors described their definitions and annotation practices of race and gender. we found that the majority of database authors neither provided sources for which gender and/or race were derived, nor described the annotation practice of identifying race and/or gender in database images. while a small subset of newer image databases are aimed at increasing, in particular, racial diversity and engage more deeply with literature on race and gender identities, they still rely on moments of visible identification that could be used to augment sociohistorical practices of oppression if adopted inappropriately. we discussed the current state of the art in database construction: apolitical and obvious approaches that erase the subjective reality of external identifications. we highlighted the politicized history of race and gender identifications, including how facial analysis systems are being adapted to expand harmful and oppressive agendas. throughout this discussion, we highlighted the role of visible difference, that otherwise erases the internal experiences of race and gender. we concluded with recommendations for improving approaches to database construction and documentation, including opportunities for authors to mitigate harm to subjects of facial analysis.",942
"It's the Wild, Wild West: Lessons Learned From IRB Members' Risk Perceptions Toward Digital Research Data",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392868,"digital technology that is prevalent in people's everyday lives, including smart home devices, mobile apps and social media, increasingly lack regulations for how the user data can be collected, used or disseminated. the cscw and the larger computing community continue to evaluate and understand the potential negative impacts of research involving digital technologies. as more research involves digital data, institutional review boards (irbs) take on the difficult task of evaluating and determining risks--likelihood of potential harms--from digital research. learning more about irbs' role in concretizing harm and its likelihood will help us critically examine the current approach to regulating digital research, and has implications for how researchers can reflect on their own data practices. we interviewed 22 u.s.-based irb members and found that, for the interviewees, ""being digital"" added a risk. being digital meant increasing possibilities of confidentiality breach, unintended collection of sensitive information, and unauthorized data reuse. concurrently, interviewees found it difficult to pinpoint the direct harms that come out of those risks. the ambiguous, messy, and situated contexts of digital research data did not fit neatly into current human subjects research protection protocols. we discuss potential solutions for understanding risks and harms of digital technology and implications for the responsibilities of the cscw and the larger computing community in conducting digital research. irb members’ primary goal is to assess risks and benefits of a research study to regulate how research studies can be performed accordingly. by probing irb members’ thinking processes around how they determine risks of a research study using digital technology, our study revealed the complexities involved in assessing risks and harms of digital data. the findings revealed what irb members’ perceived increased risks might be in data “being digital.” however, their experiences around assessing the likelihood of harms remained largely unknown. the study further revealed the ambiguous, uncertain characteristics of regulating digital research. this finding gave insights to how researchers can reflect on their own data practices and what regulatory enforcement policies can be made to aid effective protection of individuals from harm. our study is timely and presents concrete future steps in shaping the wild, wild west of digital data.",943
Privacy-Preserving Script Sharing in GUI-based Programming-by-Demonstration Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392869,"an important concern in end user development (eud) is accidentally embedding personal information in program artifacts when sharing them. this issue is particularly important in gui-based programming-by-demonstration (pbd) systems due to the lack of direct developer control of script contents. prior studies reported that these privacy concerns were the main barrier to script sharing in eud. we present a new approach that can identify and obfuscate the potential personal information in gui-based pbd scripts based on the uniqueness of information entries with respect to the corresponding app gui context. compared with the prior approaches, ours supports broader types of personal information beyond explicitly pre-specified ones, requires minimal user effort, addresses the threat of re-identification attacks, and can work with third-party apps from any task domain. our approach also recovers obfuscated fields locally on the script consumer's side to preserve the shared scripts' transparency, readability, robustness, and generalizability. our evaluation shows that our approach (1) accurately identifies the potential personal information in scripts across different apps in diverse task domains; (2) allows end-user developers to feel comfortable sharing their own scripts; and (3) enables script consumers to understand the operation of shared scripts despite the obfuscated fields. this paper presents a new mechanism, called pinalite, for identifying and obfuscating possible personal information in gui-based pbd scripts based on the uniqueness of information entries in app guis. by collecting hashed samples of gui screens from many users, pinalite is able to determine if a piece of information is likely personal by estimating the probability that a user has seen this information when that the user has visited this screen in the app. pinalite’s approach can also replace the obfuscated fields in a shared script locally using the script consumer’s app gui contents, preserving the transparency, readability, robustness and generalizability of the original script. the current version of pinalite addresses the privacy-preserving sharing of individual scripts. we are currently exploring aggregating scripts for similar tasks from multiple users. this would allow us to collect data about task automation procedures on different phones in various environments, and create more robust scripts that can handle differences in target app versions, screen layouts, phone usage contexts and task parameters. prior to the introduction of an effective privacypreserving mechanism, we cannot collect runtime data of gui-based pbd systems which contain actual script contents in the background, since the contents may contain the script author’s personal information. with pinalite, it may be feasible to extract runtime data of gui-based pbd systems in the background, which would allow the pbd system to collect more data for aggregation purposes. we also plan to conduct a larger-scale field deployment of pinalite. through that study, we can test whether our approach in fact promotes script sharing behaviors in real usage. we will also study how script authors actually use pinalite to obfuscate personal information in scripts for the purpose of sharing. another interesting future research direction is to better communicate with the script authors and the script users about the data they may share and the privacy expectations associated with sharing these data. this should help users become more comfortable with participating in the background data collection and sharing their scripts, while making informed decisions on whether to share a script and whether to mask/unmask a field in a shared script at the script review stage. we hope to investigate this topic as a part of our planned field deployment.",944
Supporting Storytelling With Evidence in Holistic Review Processes: A Participatory Design Approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392870,"review processes involve complex and often subjective decision-making tasks in which individual reviewers must read and rate submissions, such as a college application, along many relevant dimensions and typically with a rubric in mind. a common part of the work is committee review, where individual reviewers meet to discuss the merits of a particular submission in order to recommend an accept or reject decision. prior work indicates that visualization and sensemaking support may be beneficial in such processes where reviewers must present the ""story"" of the applicant under question. we conducted a series of participatory design workshops with reviewers in the domain of holistic college admissions to better understand the challenges and opportunities regarding storytelling. based on these workshops, we contribute a characterization for how reviewers in this domain construct visual stories, we provide guidance for designing for evidence capture and storytelling, and we draw parallels and distinctions between this domain and other reviewing domains. to conclude, we expanded on prior field work [37] to explore more deeply the role of storytelling in the holistic admissions domain. through three participatory design workshops, we discovered commonalities and differences in how stories are composed and told and characterized these stories using categorizations from existing literature on visual narratives. through co-design iterations with a college admissions team, we explored possible decision sheet redesigns for incorporating storytelling and learned about how they could impact the holistic review process. finally, we provide design suggestions and future research directions regarding storytelling and evidence capture in review processes.",945
Configuring Audiences: A Case Study of Email Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392871,"when people communicate with each other, their choice of what to say is tied to their perceptions of the audience. for many communication channels, people have some ability to explicitly specify their audience members and the different roles they can play. while existing accounts of communication behavior have largely focused on how people tailor the content of their messages, we focus on the configuring of the audience as a complementary family of decisions in communication. we formulate a general description of audience configuration choices, highlighting key aspects of the audience that people could configure to reflect a range of communicative goals. we then illustrate these ideas via a case study of email usage-a realistic domain where audience configuration choices are particularly fine-grained and explicit in how email senders fill the to and cc address fields. in a large collection of enterprise emails, we explore how people configure their audiences, finding salient patterns relating a sender's choice of configuration to the types of participants in the email exchange, the content of the message, and the nature of the subsequent interactions. our formulation and findings show how analyzing audience configurations can enrich and extend existing accounts of communication behavior, and frame research directions on audience configuration decisions in communication and collaboration.",946
"Using Cultural Probes in HCI4D/ICTD: A Design Case Study from Bungoma, Kenya",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392873,"cultural probes have long been used in hci to provide designers with glimpses into the local cultures for which they are designing, and thereby inspire novel design proposals. hci4d/ictd researchers are increasingly interested in more deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly related to socioeconomic development, and in considering new design approaches. however, few use this subjective, design-led method in their research. in this paper, i present a case study detailing my experience designing and deploying cultural probes in bungoma, kenya. returns from my comment cards and digital camera activities draw attention to probe recipients' unique experiences and to bungoma's distinctive characteristics; they also inspired a series of speculative design proposals. my experience motivates a discussion that elaborates on how a cultural probes approach can benefit hci4d/ictd research by raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit of a single solution in design. more broadly, i offer a case study demonstrating an alternative way to approach design in hci4d/ictd. i present a personal account of my experience using cultural probes in bungoma county, kenya. my exploration into using the method in rural kenya seemed successful. this conclusion is based on the richness and diversity of the hundreds of photographs participants took, the stories and design proposals that emerged from my interactions with them, and the ongoing conversations between myself and the probe recipients. i presented a few of the probe returns here, and will explore other ways to disseminate them (e.g., a website). i anticipate learning more about the important issues affecting participants’ interactions with technology when i share my design workbook with them upon my return to their homes. this case study is just one account; i acknowledge that another person’s experience would be different, as would my use of the approach elsewhere in kenya. a person who is more fluent in swahili, may have written the probe activities in that language. if i was conducting research in, for example, siaya county, i would consider using dholuo (the language which is more commonly spoken there) when developing probe activities. if my project was being carried out in an urban area, such as nairobi, i may have relied on the postal service to deliver the probe returns to me, because it tends to be more reliable there than in bungoma. similarly, the returns that would emerge from deploying probes elsewhere, and with different people, would be different than those i received, as would someone else’s interpretation of them, and the design concepts they would inspire. herein lies another benefit of using cultural probes in hci4d/ict4d, it draws attention to these important, but often overlooked differences in countries, and in how researchers respond to them. my conclusion is that greater use of cultural probes has much to offer hci4d/ict4d, especially for the ways they acknowledge the subjectivity, bias, complexity, and emotion that is inherent (and unavoidable) in research. my hope is that embracing these factors can inject more creativity into how research is conducted in developing regions, and into the technologies designed for them, promote challenging discussions about the nature of hci4d/ictd research and how it is conducted, and prompt these communities to take seriously alternative forms of knowledge in design.",947
Exposing Error in Poverty Management Technology: A Method for Auditing Government Benefits Screening Tools,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392874,"public benefits programs help people afford necessities like food, housing, and healthcare. in the us, such programs are means-tested: applicants must complete long forms to prove financial distress before receiving aid. online benefits screening tools provide a gloss of such forms, advising households about their eligibility prior to completing full applications. if incorrectly implemented, screening tools may discourage qualified households from applying for benefits. unfortunately, errors in screening tools are difficult to detect because they surface one at a time and difficult to contest because unofficial determinations do not generate a paper trail. we introduce a method for auditing such tools in four steps: 1) generate test households, 2) automatically populate screening questions with household information and retrieve determinations, 3) translate eligibility guidelines into computer code to generate ground truth determinations, and 4) identify conflicting determinations to detect errors. we illustrated our method on a real screening tool with households modeled from census data. our method exposed major errors with corresponding examples to reproduce them. our work provides a necessary corrective to an already arduous benefits application process. as long as the us welfare system remains so complex, the tools meant to help people navigate it should be well calibrated. we do not know what potential applicants expect from an interaction with a screening tool, nor how they make sense of eligibility predictions. while our auditing method could help produce more accurate screening tools, it alone will not address the structural reasons that these errors exist and have been tolerated. screening tools are not the single broken piece in an otherwise perfect welfare system. errors in full benefits applications have caused real, demonstrable deprivation [13, 25]. future work could explore auditing methods for automated application evaluation technology. this would require much greater institutional cooperation than we secured. our method cannot be directly fitted to this technology, since filing false applications is fraud. further, full applications are far more complex than screening tools and their records persist across interaction sessions. researchers in other disciplines have engaged with these issues and are exploring alternate ways to structure the relations between the state and the poor. they might not know what technology is available to advance those visions. in the future, we should not just be looking to verify poverty management tools and perfect existing institutional practices. instead, we must interrogate the structural problems that lead to these broken systems. if we believe that technology can play a positive role in poverty management, we can imagine better systems for providing care.",948
Learning from Tweets: Opportunities and Challenges to Inform Policy Making During Dengue Epidemic,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392875,"social media platforms are widely used by people to report, access, and share information during outbreaks and epidemics. although government agencies and healthcare institutions in developed regions are increasingly relying on social media to develop epidemic forecasts and outbreak response, there is a limited understanding of how people in developing regions interact on social media during outbreaks and what useful insights this dataset could offer during public health crises. in this work, we examined 28,688 tweets to identify public health issues during dengue epidemic in bangladesh and found several insights, such as irregularities in dengue diagnosis and treatment, shortage of blood supply for rh negative blood groups, and high local transmission of dengue during eid-ul-adha, that impact disease preparedness and outbreak response. we discuss the opportunities and challenges in analyzing tweets and outline how government agencies and healthcare institutions can use social media health data to inform policy making during public health crises. we present an in-depth analysis of the tweets related to dengue epidemic in bangladesh to explore the role of social media health data in informing policy making approaches. we apply a humancentered lens to discover insights from the reactions and responses of twitter users to dengue epidemic in bangladesh. our analysis identified various epidemiological, geographical, cultural, and societal factors that mediated the outcomes of dengue epidemic in bangladesh, which were not perceptible at the first glance. we also showed how our findings could inform policy making approaches to control dengue outbreaks. we believe this work will greatly facilitate social media supported cooperative works to cope with public health crises in developing countries.",949
MAMAS: Supporting Parent--Child Mealtime Interactions Using Automated Tracking and Speech Recognition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392876,"many parents of young children find it challenging to deal with their children's eating problems, and parent--child mealtime interaction is fundamental in forming children's healthy eating habits. in this paper, we present the results of a three-week study through which we deployed a mealtime assistant application, mamas, for monitoring parent--child mealtime conversation and food intake with 15 parent--child pairs. our findings indicate that the use of mamas helped 1) increase children's autonomy during mealtime, 2) enhance parents' self-awareness of their words and behaviors, 3) promote the parent--child relationship, and 4) positively influence the mealtime experiences of the entire family. the study also revealed some challenges in eating behavior interventions due to the complex dynamics of childhood eating problems. based on the findings, we discuss how a mealtime assistant application can be better designed for parents and children with challenging eating behaviors. in this study, we investigated the impact of a mealtime assistant system for improving children’s challenging eating behaviors by monitoring children’s food intake and parent–child interaction through a three-week deployment study. our findings showed that the use of mamas helped increase children’s autonomy during mealtime, enhance parents’ self-awareness of their words and behaviors, promote parent–child relationships, and positively influence the mealtime experiences of the entire family. furthermore, the findings of the study revealed some challenges in eating behavior interventions due to the complex dynamics of childhood eating problems. based on the findings, we discussed the potential benefits of the semi-automated tracking approach, the importance of encouraging self-reflection on the subjective aspect of mealtime experiences, ways to provide technological support for quality family conversations during mealtime, and the need for facilitating the flexible use of tracking systems. we hope more research in this area will investigate ways to better assist parents in dealing with their children’s challenging eating behaviors, considering the complex dynamics of family mealtimes.",950
Parallel Worlds: Repeated Initializations of the Same Team to Improve Team Viability,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392877,"a team's early interactions are influential: small behaviors cascade, driving the team either toward successful collaboration or toward fracture. would a team be more viable if it could undo initial interactional missteps and try again? we introduce a technique that supports online and remote teams in creating multiple parallel worlds: the same team meets many times, led to believe that each convening is with a new team due to pseudonym masking while actual membership remains static. afterward, the team moves forward with the parallel world with the highest viability by using the same pseudonyms and conversation history from that instance. in two experiments, we find that this technique improves team viability: teams that are reconvened from the highest-viability parallel world are significantly more viable than the same group meeting in a new parallel world. our work suggests parallel worlds can help teams start off on the right foot - and stay there. in this article, we introduce a parallel world intervention to support high viability collaborations for online and remote teams. we examined how and to what extent the manipulation of transactive memory through selective reestablishment of specific team interactions impacts a team’s present viability during a team-based creative task. we find that upon reconvening the highest-viability parallel world, the second interaction achieves a viability consistent with its first interaction and higher than that of a fresh start. furthermore, when the lowest-viability parallel world is reconvened, team viability is remediated but does not improve past the level of a fresh start. thus, by leveraging the large variation in dynamics for a single team and masking to erase unfavorable past interactions, we help teams find their best configuration and stay there even if the team had originally started off on the wrong foot. this research offers opportunities for online teams to go beyond being there [31] — to gain opportunities that traditional, in-person teams lack. by helping teams sidestep accidental false starts early rather than pursuing a sometimes quixotic quest to undo them, we hope that this approach can help promote more pro-social teamwork and enjoyable collaborations.",951
"Human Factors in Model Interpretability: Industry Practices, Challenges, and Needs",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392878,"as the use of machine learning (ml) models in product development and data-driven decision-making processes became pervasive in many domains, people's focus on building a well-performing model has increasingly shifted to understanding how their model works. while scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like hci, ml, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. this lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. to bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ml models. the characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. we present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs. in this work, we empirically investigated industry practitioners’ model interpretability practices, challenges, and needs. we describe roles, processes, goals, and strategies around interpretability practiced by ml practitioners working in a variety of domains. we draw out important contrasts between our results and the predominant framing of interpretability in existing research as a property of a model that can be defined solely in light of an individual versus a ml model’s alignment. our results lead us to characterize interpretability as inherently social and negotiated, aimed at fostering trust both in people and in models, context-dependent, and arising from careful comparisons of human mental models. our identification of unaddressed technological needs among practitioners is intended to help researchers direct their attention to unaddressed, yet prevalent, challenges in industry.",952
Decolonizing Tactics as Collective Resilience: Identity Work of AAPI Communities on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392881,"asian american and pacific islander (aapi) communities use online platforms like reddit to build capacity for resilience from white hegemony. we conduct interviews with 21 moderators of aapi subreddits to understand how sociotechnical systems contour and contribute to the marginalization of online communities. we examine marginalization through the analytic framework of decolonization and uncover the threats and tactics that aapi redditors encounter and employ to decolonize their collective identity. we find that moderators of aapi subreddits develop collective resilience within their online communities by reclaiming space to confront brigade invasion, recording collective memory to circumvent systemic erasure, and revising cultural narratives to deconstruct colonial mentality. we describe how algorithmic configurations within sociotechnical systems reaffirm existing hegemonic values and discuss how users and designers of sociotechnical systems may work toward resisting white hegemony. while the marginalization of groups has been occurring for millennia, online communities provide a space for people to safely negotiate tensions of their intersectional identities on topics such as race or citizenship. in this paper, we focus on uncovering how aapi subreddits enable the process of decolonization to occur and build capacity for collective resilience. we find that these online communities constantly fight for their existence through decolonizing tactics that include reclaiming space to confront brigade invasion, recording collective memory to circumvent systemic erasure, and revising cultural narratives to deconstruct colonial mentality. we center the perspectives of aapi moderators and discuss how their acts of resistance challenge and circumvent their systemic marginalization as materialized by white hegemonic forces.",953
DreamCatcher: Exploring How Parents and School-Age Children can Track and Review Sleep Information Together,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3392882,"parents and their school-age children can impact one another's sleep. most sleep-tracking tools, however, are designed for adults and make it difficult for parents and children to track together. to examine how to design a family-centered sleep tracking tool, we designed dreamcatcher. dreamcatcher is an in-home, interactive, shared display that aggregates data from wrist-worn sleep sensors and self-reported mood. we deployed dreamcatcher as a probe to examine the design space of tracking sleep as a family. ten families participated in the study probe between 15 and 50 days. this study uses a family systems perspective to explore research questions regarding the feasibility of children actively tracking health data alongside their parents and the effects of tracking and sharing on family dynamics. our results indicate that children can be active tracking contributors and that having parents and children track together encourages turn-taking and working together. however, there were also moments when family members, in particular parents, felt discomfort from sharing their sleep and mood with other family members. our research contributes to a growing understanding of designing family centered health-informatics tools to support the combined needs of parents and children. this paper demonstrates opportunities for including children in family-centered tracking technologies. it contributes: (1) an empirical understanding of how to design family-centered tracking tools that support parents and children, and (2) a novel technological artifact for family-based sleep and mood tracking in the home. we explored designing a tool that supports parents and children in tracking and reflecting on sleep and mood. from the health perspective, we focused on family sleep due to its overall importance in family health, the relationship between children’s and parent sleep, and because it is an interesting case study for exploring privacy issues. from a technological perspective, we focused on family sleep because most sleep tracking platforms focus on a single adult user. our exploration centers on the iterative design process, development, and deployment of a family-centered, sleep-tracking system, called dreamcatcher. our results show that children can participate in tracking along with their parents. children reported mood on behalf of themselves and others, interacted with the sleep views more than parents, and left audio messages as much as their parents. providing the means for parents and children to track together affects family tracking dynamics. tracking technology generally supports a parent tracking a child –which fits into the boundary that exists of parents taking care of children. dreamcatcher distributed tracking across all family members, which changed the traditional role of a parent being the sole tracker to children self-reporting, reporting on behalf of their parents, and viewing information for all family members through one representation. our work shows that even if one family members discontinued to track, the design of dreamcatcher allowed for the rest of the family to continue tracking. future work should apply the insights and address the challenges presented in this study. continuing research in the design of family tracking technologies has the potential to support family-focused technological behavioral intervention to improve sleep quality.",954

Can you Turn it Off?: The Spatial and Social Context of Mobile Disturbance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415162,"contemporary mobile devices continuously interrupt people with notifications in various and changing physical environments. as different places can have different social setting, understanding how disturbing an interruption might be to people around the user is not a straightforward task. to understand how users perceive disturbance in their social environment, we analyze the results of a 3-week user study with 50 participants using the experience sampling method and log analysis. we show that perceptions of disturbance are strongly related to the social norms surrounding the place, such as whether the place is considered private or public, even when controlling for the number of people around the user. furthermore, users' perceptions of disturbance are also related to the activity carried out on the phone, and the subjective perceptions of isolation from other people in the space. we conclude the paper by discussing how our findings can be used to design new mobile devices that are aware of the social norms and their users' environmental context. our paper explores the factors that are related to the way social disturbance is perceived by users. social disturbance is related to the social context of the place, including the number of people around the user, how public the place is perceived, as well as the activity carried out in the place. the norms and the perceptions of a place are at least as important (if not more important) than the its functional properties (such as the number of people in the place). factors that are related to the user’s own activities also play a role: perceptions of privacy and the activity carried on the phone. overall, these results point to ways in which mobile interruption management systems, including both applications and operating systems, might be designed differently to help support devices that try to respect the social norms around the users and to reduce social tensions. this might involve sensors that are more aware of what other people are doing in this space, as well as opportunities to externalize and communicate these norms. our methodology can serve as a case study for investigating the use of various mobile technologies, quickly collecting information grounded within a physical context, and guiding the development of technologies that are more sensitive to the physical contexts or urban environments that are geared towards mobile technologies.",956
Hate begets Hate: A Temporal Study of Hate Speech,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415163,"with the ongoing debate on 'freedom of speech' vs. 'hate speech,' there is an urgent need to carefully understand the consequences of the inevitable culmination of the two, i.e., 'freedom of hate speech' over time. an ideal scenario to understand this would be to observe the effects of hate speech in an (almost) unrestricted environment. hence, we perform the first temporal analysis of hate speech on gab.com, a social media site with very loose moderation policy. we first generate temporal snapshots of gab from millions of posts and users. using these temporal snapshots, we compute an activity vector based on degroot model to identify hateful users. the amount of hate speech in gab is steadily increasing and the new users are becoming hateful at an increased and faster rate. further, our analysis analysis reveals that the hate users are occupying the prominent positions in the gab network. also, the language used by the community as a whole seem to correlate more with that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful ones. we discuss how, many crucial design questions in cscw open up from our work. in this paper, we perform the ""rst temporal analysis of hate speech in online social media. using an extensive dataset of 21m posts by 314k users on gab, we divide the dataset into multiple snapshots and assign a hate score to each user at every snapshot. we then check for variations in the hate score of the user. we characterize these account types on the basis of text and network structure. we observe that a large fraction of hateful users occupy the core of the gab network and they reach the core at a much faster rate as compared to non-hateful users. the language of the community as a whole is getting more correlated to that of the hateful users as compared to the non-hateful users. our work would be useful to platform designers to detect the hateful users at an early stage and introduce appropriate measures to moderate the users’ stance.",957
"Investigating Differences in Crowdsourced News Credibility Assessment: Raters, Tasks, and Expert Criteria",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415164,"misinformation about critical issues such as climate change and vaccine safety is oftentimes amplified on online social and search platforms. the crowdsourcing of content credibility assessment by laypeople has been proposed as one strategy to combat misinformation by attempting to replicate the assessments of experts at scale. in this work, we investigate news credibility assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between them differ. we gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken from 2 crowd groups---journalism students and upwork workers---as well as 2 expert groups---journalists and scientists---on a varied set of 50 news articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between public opinion and expert consensus. examining the ratings, we find differences in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication. finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. from these findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd processes that are tailored to specific crowds and types of content. in this work, using the domain of climate news, we dive into the notion of crowdsourcing credibility through a series of analyses on its main components: the makeup of the crowd, the scope of tasks that the crowd is assigned, and the subject area expert criteria in question. in particular, we explore characteristics of the “crowd,” in terms of traits such as background, demographics, and political leaning, and whether they have bearings on task performance. we show this in a comparison between ratings made by students and others recruited through journalism networks versus crowd workers on upwork. we also interrogate the nature of the crowdsourcing task itself, finding that the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication has different relationship to both crowds and experts. this led us to better understand the reasoning of experts themselves. in our case, we looked at how experts in journalism versus experts in science have different ways to assess article credibility based on the factors such as credible evidence/grounding and publication reputation. disagreement among raters is neither always bad nor always about their capacities, but at times about suitability of the task [2] and about the particular subject area expertise in question as well. by investigating the variability introduced by all these components, we point towards how the design of crowd assessments to approximate expert-level credibility can be made more robust.",958
From Virtual Strangers to IRL Friends: Relationship Development in Livestreaming Communities on Twitch,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415165,"accounts of the social experience within livestreaming channels vary widely, from the frenetic ""crowdroar"" offered in some channels to the close-knit, ""participatory communities"" within others. what kinds of livestreaming communities enable the types of meaningful conversation and connection that support relationship development, and how? in this paper, we explore how personal relationships develop within twitch, a popular livestreaming service. interviews with 21 pairs who met initially within twitch channels illustrate how interactions originating in twitch's text-based, pseudonymous chat environment can evolve into close relationships, marked by substantial trust and support. consistent with walther's hyperpersonal model, these environments facilitate self-disclosure and conversation by reducing physical cues and emphasizing common ground, while frequent, low-stakes interaction allow relationships to deepen over time. our findings also highlight boundaries of the hyperpersonal model. as group size increases, participants leverage affordances for elevated visibility to spark interactions; as relationships deepen, they incorporate complementary media channels to increase intimacy. often, relationships become so deep through purely computer-mediated channels that face-to-face meetings become yet another step in a continuum of relationship development. findings from a survey of 1,367 members of twitch communities demonstrate how the suitability of these spaces as venues for relational interaction decreases as communities increase in size. together, these findings illustrate vividly how hyperpersonal interaction functions in the context of real online communities. we consider implications for the design and management of online communities, including their potential for supporting ""strong bridges,"" relationships which combine the benefits of strong ties and network bridges. public perception of livestreaming services is often driven by massive streams and events, leading many non-users to believe that meaningful connection is impossible, but the experiences of individuals engaging with these services has often shown otherwise. we began this study to understand how common these experiences were, and to understand how deep, human connections could develop within this pseudonymous, often chaotic, and sometimes mischievous environment. we were surprised and deeply impressed by the depth of the relationships that our participants described and the levels of social, emotional, and instrumental support which grew from connections created by that environment. the findings of this work provide insight into how sociotechnical design decisions influence relationship formation processes in computer-mediated communication spaces and point to the potential of cmc environments for fostering “strong bridges” or relationships that offer a high degree of support alongside access to resources from outside one’s network.",959
Exploring Design Principles for Sharing of Personal Informatics Data on Ephemeral Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415166,"people often do not receive the engagement or responses they desire when they share on broad social media platforms. sharers are hesitant to share trivial accomplishments, and the emphasis on data often results posts that audiences find repetitive or unengaging. ephemeral social media's focus on self-authored content and sharing trivial accomplishments has the potential to ameliorate these challenges. we explore design principles for incorporating personal informatics data like steps, heart rate, or duration in data-driven stickers as a first step towards integrating these data into ephemeral social media. we examine the effect of a sticker's presentation style, domain, domain-relevance, and background through three surveys with 506 total participants. we uncover the importance of domain-relevant backgrounds and stickers, identify the situational value of stickers styled as analogies, embellished, and badges, and demonstrate that data-driven stickers can make ephemeral content more informative and entertaining, discussing implications for platforms and tools. we contribute design recommendations for sharing personal informatics data via overlays on ephemeral social media, demonstrating that these overlays are entertaining and informative. the badge, embellished, and analogy stickers we designed can each offer value when explaining moments or celebrating them, though preference depends on circumstance and aesthetics. when possible, the design of overlays should reflect the domain being shared and allow the sharer to use their own photo as a background. integrating these stickers into ephemeral platforms and evaluating them could lead to useful insights about when people find it most useful to include personal informatics data in posts to ephemeral social media.",960
Human-AI Collaboration in a Cooperative Game Setting: Measuring Social Perception and Outcomes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415167,"human-ai interaction is pervasive across many areas of our day to day lives. in this paper, we investigate human-ai collaboration in the context of a collaborative ai-driven word association game with partially observable information. in our experiments, we test various dimensions of subjective social perceptions (rapport, intelligence, creativity and likeability) of participants towards their partners when participants believe they are playing with an ai or with a human. we also test subjective social perceptions of participants towards their partners when participants are presented with a variety of confidence levels. we ran a large scale study on mechanical turk (n=164) of this collaborative game. our results show that when participants believe their partners were human, they found their partners to be more likeable, intelligent, creative and having more rapport and use more positive words to describe their partner's attributes than when they believed they were interacting with an ai partner. we also found no differences in game outcome including win rate and turns to completion. drawing on both quantitative and qualitative findings, we discuss ai agent transparency, include design implications for tools incorporating or supporting human-ai collaboration, and lay out directions for future research. our findings lead to implications for other forms of human-ai interaction and communication. in this work, we investigate user perception towards a partner in an ai-driven game when users are told they are competing against a bot and when users are told they are competing against a human. we found that people find their partners to be more intelligent, more likeable, more creative and overall have more rapport with partners if people believed to be interacting with a human. we also investigated the effect of confidence on social perception and find that users had more rapport with partners who did not show confidence or displayed low confidence. interactions were constant for all participants despite user perception of whether the partner was an ai or a human, but participants also had more positive sentiment towards their “human” partners. however, unlike in human-human collaboration studies, in our human-ai context, these social perceptions did not impact the collaboration outcomes (i.e. game win/loss). this research leads to new insights about how to study human-ai collaboration and lays the groundwork for future studies.",961
Using the Crowd to Prevent Harmful AI Behavior,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415168,"to prevent harmful ai behavior, people need to specify constraints that forbid undesirable actions. unfortunately, this is a complex task, since writing rules that distinguish harmful from non-harmful actions tends to be quite difficult in real-world situations. therefore, such decisions have historically been made by a small group of powerful ai companies and developers, with limited community input. in this paper, we study how to enable a crowd of non-ai experts to work together to communicate high-quality, reliable constraints to ai systems. we first focus on understanding how humans reason about temporal dynamics in the context of ai behavior, finding through experiments on a novel game-based testbed that participants tend to adopt a long-term notion of harm, even in uncertain situations that do not affect them directly. building off of this insight, we explore task design for long-term constraint specification, developing new filtering approaches and new methods of promoting user reflection. next, we develop a novel rule-based interface which allows people to craft rules in an accessible fashion without programming knowledge. we test our approaches on a real-world ai problem in the domain of education, and find that our new filtering mechanisms and interfaces significantly improve constraint quality and human efficiency. we also demonstrate how these systems can be applied to other real-world ai problems (e.g. in social networks). in this paper, we studied how one can use a crowd of humans to help prevent harmful ai behavior. we found that crowd workers seem inclined to adopt a long-term notion of harm even in uncertain settings, a fact which allows the task of ai constraint specification to be more easily divided up across individuals. in more complicated real-world scenarios, we found that making decisions about the harmfulness of ai actions can be quite challenging, but our new fake gold and one-sided explanation designs were able to substantially increase constraint quality. further, our novel rulebased interface is quite effective, remaining accessible while greatly increasing human efficiency. in this paper, we have examined cases where decisions about ai harm require cognitive effort to determine but are ultimately fairly clear-cut, whereas the moral machine work studied the opposite extreme: easy to understand but highly controversial decisions. future work includes exploring how to combine these two paradigms to reliably determine harmful behavior in situations that are both complex and highly controversial. indeed, there are many future directions here, as we do not yet know how to effectively use the crowd when the harm of a complex task is not so black-and-white but instead is highly abstract, contested, or personal. for instance, consider the decision of when to open the economy during a novel viral pandemic. although most would agree that we want to make the decision that causes the least harm, how to define “harm” is extremely complex, uncertain, and controversial. for instance, how can we determine how to trade-off economic harm with the chance of risking human lives? to answer these questions, data-driven ai approaches alone are not sufficient, and we must incorporate the values and opinions of an extremely diverse set of stakeholders, including medical professionals, business owners, and laypeople. to bring individuals with this vast range of expertise into the conversation, we first need technology which makes decision-making surrounding ai safety accessible to a broader population. it is also vital that the ai safety questions posed are in some sense sound; importantly, they should minimize the influence of ai “experts” and shift power to impacted groups. this paper takes the first step in that direction, moving towards a future where diverse groups of people without ai expertise can work effectively together to directly address real-world ai decision-making and thus prevent ai harm.",962
Life Review Using a Life Metaphoric Game to Promote Intergenerational Communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415169,"this study explores whether a life metaphoric game can effectively facilitate communication between senior participants and young adult partners during a life review activity. life review provides older adults with opportunities to organize their past experiences, rediscover the meaning of life, and prepare for their future life and eventual death. we held workshops in which 33 senior participants (ages 51-85) co-played a commercial game, titled ""long journey of life,"" paired with young adult partners (ages 19-23). the young partners asked senior participants about their associated memories during the life review activity. through inductive thematic analysis, we found seven communication themes during the life review activity: reminiscence, future and death preparation, life advice, appreciation and evaluation, small talks involving self-disclosure, interpretation of metaphors, and explanation of game control methods. we investigated the relationships between communication themes and game design elements that promote conversation. in addition, we identified how participants' responses to the game differ depending on the player's characteristics and generation. game design suggestions for an effective intergenerational life review using digital games were offered. this study revealed that life metaphoric games could be useful tools to promote various communication themes during intergenerational life review activities. however, some limitations of this study should be considered. first, although a dyadic approach was adopted, but there was the imbalance in numbers between senior participants and young partners. moreover, the responses of young partners were not collected and analyzed sufficiently in comparison to the senior participants. second, we could not include participants in familial relationships, even though such activities are well-suited for people in familial relationships. third, because the game was not targeted at older adults or intentionally designed for life review, accessibility with respect to the size of text and objects was unsatisfactory for some participants. finally, the traditional structured life review is performed via an in-depth interview about each life stage through eight meetings [31]. however, this workshop was conducted as a one-day session, and the gameplay times were short. as the workshop was conducted over a short period, changes in the relationship between the reviewer and listener could not be carefully observed. despite the limitations, the study attempted a new activity by combining intergenerational play and life review. future research is needed to investigate whether these activities can contribute to promoting successful aging and intergenerational relationships. in addition, it is necessary to expand the scope of the study to include familial relationships. although games are primarily designed for young adults, many middle- and older-aged players have continuously played them since their childhood. the demand for games among such players has resulted in a mature gaming industry. successful life review games deliver players with rich impressions through reminiscence associated with the game’s stories. in addition, they can help older adults take on a storytelling role, allowing them to continually contribute to the community and maintain their social status. these findings can support future researchers and designers of games for life review.",963
Understanding the Homepreneurship Opportunities Afforded by Social Networking and Personal Fabrication Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415170,"the decreased cost and increased usability of personal fabrication technologies has enabled a new generation of crafters to integrate digital designs and computationally created artifacts into physically-based practices. with the simultaneous ubiquity of e-commerce and social networking channels, these technologies have enabled many crafters to transform their hobbies into home-based businesses. to understand the opportunities and challenges that fusing social networking platforms, personal fabrication equipment, and e-commerce have afforded these homepreneurs, an online survey and follow-up interviews were conducted with crafters who use hobbyist cutting plotters to personalize and sell goods online. the findings uncovered an emerging group of homepreneurs, i.e., mompreneurs, who use these technologies for supplemental income for their families and highlighted the emotional and opportunistic benefits that such personalized, at-home manufacturing affords. they also highlighted the workflows and lifestyle implications of using these technologies to run home-based businesses, the multi-faceted usage and dependence these homepreneurs have on online social platforms such as facebook, the complex software toolchains that are used, and the commonplace practice of appropriating designs from others that occurs in this community. the continued ubiquity and decreased cost of personal fabrication equipment has enabled many to enhance traditional handiwork practices and processes with technology. simultaneously, the reach and growing pervasiveness of social networking platforms has enabled those with entrepreneurial goals to have access to, and cultivate, growing client bases. nowhere have the opportunities afforded by the fusion of personal fabrication and social networking been more visibly prevalent than within the crafting community. as this work has demonstrated, a growing population of crafters have begun using low-cost desktop cutting plotters to start businesses that create bespoke, personalized goods for others. through interview and survey data with canadians who are part of this community, this work uncovered a growing subset of homepreneurs, i.e., mompreneurs, that balance childcare or fulltime jobs with their business activities using conjoined spaces in their homes. the data underscored the complex software tool chains that these deskilled users have developed to create personalized deigns and graphics for their business and the challenges that arise when these safe, portable, and easy to use personal fabrication machines are used at home for entrepreneurial purposes. interestingly, facebook was also found to act as a scaffold to the digital economy for these homepreneurs through its frictionless ability to support the finding of local clients, gathering of ideas for goods, co-working on orders with clients, searching for help, researching one’s competition, and the acquisition of materials. the downside of using such platforms, however, was that homepreneurs often fused their personal and business lives online, resulting in challenges with identity management. fueled by the saturated completion within homepreneurs’ local areas and the functionality found in cutting plotter software, the appropriation of other’s intellectual property was also found to be a rampant and significant practice and challenge within this community. by identifying the obstacles these homepreneurs face when using fabrication machines such as cutting plotters, the implications of using social media to spur local sales, and the lifestyle influences of their workflows, this research has demonstrated the opportunities that the fusion of personal fabrication, social media, and e-commerce have provided to a growing community of crafters. as the frontier of personal fabrication technologies and equipment continues to expand, equipment becomes more inexpensive and attainable, and the community and their activities become more diverse, there will be an increased need to further understand and develop solutions to the opportunities and challenges that these homepreneurs and other content creators will face.",964
Wikipedia Edit-a-thons as Sites of Public Pedagogy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415171,"wikipedia edit-a-thon events provide a targeted approach toward incorporating new knowledge into the online encyclopedia while also offering pathways toward new editor participation. through the analysis of interviews with 13 edit-a-thon facilitators, however, we find motivations for running edit-a-thons extend far beyond adding content and editors. in this paper, we uncover how a range of personal and institutional values inspire these event facilitators toward fulfilling broader goals including fostering information literacy and establishing community relationships outside of wikipedia. along with reporting motivations, values, and goals, we also describe strategies facilitators adopt in their practice. next, we discuss challenges faced by facilitators as they organize edit-a-thons. we situate our findings within two complementary theoretical lenses-information ecologies and public pedagogy to guide our interpretation. finally, we suggest new ways in which edit-a-thons, as well as similar peer production events and communities, can be understood, studied, and evaluated. in september 2019, as we were conducting this study, the wikimedia foundation released a highlevel report titled “wikimedia movement organizers: understanding the people who power the movement” [58]. “organizers” in this report include not only people who organize and facilitate edit-a-thons, but also those who disseminate wikipedia content in settings with limited internet connectivity, coordinate large-scale contribution of media artifacts (e.g., historical photos) and others from cultural and educational institutions. many of the findings of the report, especially on organizers’ motivations and the results of their efforts, echo what we find in our study. we also see a de-centering of editing—“editing is not a requirement,” (p. 26)—and a recognition that the work of these organizers enable the integration of wikimedia “into a wider knowledge ecosystem” (p. 3). our work complements this report by offering an in-depth and independent analysis of edit-athon facilitation. we focus on edit-a-thon facilitators’ contributions to the creation and evolution of local knowledge and information ecosystems—and how these ecosystems connect to and interact with the broader wikipedia community and ecosystems. this process has broad implications as it represents how knowledge—particularly of subjects at the margins and underrepresented in wikipedia—is produced, negotiated, and recorded within an online community. the resulting knowledge, as discussed earlier in our introduction and discussion sections (§ 1,§ 5.3), is not only visible within wikipedia, but also present in google search results, facebook feeds, and other seemingly independent contexts that constitute our broader digital cultures. emergent artificial intelligence technologies also use wikipedia content as training data, which can further propagate wikipedia’s gaps and biases [32]. along with an analysis of how local information ecologies emerge, a central contribution of our work is an accounting and theoretical grounding of resistance to these biases. the implication of what we find applies to both future cscw research as well as programs seeking to support peer production of free and open content online. what future cscw researchers studying digital cultures, as well as programs seeking to support and evaluate edit-a-thons and similar offline events, need to be aware of is these events are not simply about new contributions and contributors, but also represent sites of negotiation and contestation. decisions regarding who participates, who is visible, what is counted as knowledge, what is recorded, and what is shown to others not only affect users of online peer production platforms, but almost everyone using the internet today",965
Informational Friction as a Lens for Studying Algorithmic Aspects of Privacy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415172,"this paper addresses challenges in conceptualizing privacy posed by algorithmic systems that can infer sensitive information from seemingly innocuous data. this type of privacy is of imminent concern due to the rapid adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence systems in virtually every industry. in this paper, we suggest informational friction, a concept from floridi's ethics of information, as a valuable conceptual lens for studying algorithmic aspects of privacy. informational friction describes the amount of work required for one agent to access or alter the information of another. by focusing on amount of work, rather than the type of information or manner in which it is collected, informational friction can help to explain why automated analyses should raise privacy concerns independently of, and in addition to, those associated with data collection. as a demonstration, this paper analyze law enforcement use of facial recognition, andfacebook's targeted advertising model using informational friction and demonstrate risks inherent to these systems which are not completely identified in another popular framework, nissenbaum's contextual integrity.the paper concludes with a discussion of broader implications, both for privacy research and for privacy regulation. this paper explores how floridi’s concept of informational friction can provide valuable perspectives on modern privacy issues, especially those concerning automated data analysis [30]. by investigating the amount of effort required to access an agent’s information, we can move beyond a binary distinction, between “violated” and “not violated,” and towards a more qualitative assessment of how the features and context of a system increase or decrease informational friction. to reiterate, increasing information friction does not necessarily provide a lever for designers or policy makers to increase privacy. rather, when studying, crafting policy around, and designing technology, if suggests that we should pay attention not only to whether current practices are acceptable or not, but also how they alter informational friction to make more or less privacy actually attainable. put differently, we should not necessarily seek in every instance to ameliorate algorithmic reductions in privacy by increasing informational friction. rather, for any given mitigation strategy, we can ask what impact that strategy may have on informational friction. while this is not the only important question to ask in assessing possible mitigation strategies, it is a valuable one that, as argued in this paper, can reveal aspects not well highlighted via other conceptual framings. moreover, focusing on the specific features that elevate this risk may open up more options to protect internet users, both in terms of regulatory policies and in terms of technology design.",966
Mediating Community-AI Interaction through Situated Explanation: The Case of AI-Led Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415173,"artificial intelligence (ai) has become prevalent in our everyday technologies and impacts both individuals and communities. the explainable ai (xai) scholarship has explored the philosophical nature of explanation and technical explanations, which are usually driven by experts in lab settings and can be challenging for laypersons to understand. in addition, existing xai research tends to focus on the individual level. little is known about how people understand and explain ai-led decisions in the community context. drawing from xai and activity theory, a foundational hci theory, we theorize how explanation is situated in a community's shared values, norms, knowledge, and practices, and how situated explanation mediates community-ai interaction. we then present a case study of ai-led moderation, where community members collectively develop explanations of ai-led decisions, most of which are automated punishments. lastly, we discuss the implications of this framework at the intersection of cscw, hci, and xai. in this paper, we drew from activity theory, a foundational hci theory, to analyze the mediational role of explanation in community-ai interaction. we presented an empirical case to further illustrate the at analysis of explainable ai. we argue that explanation is not just about providing accurate information about the internal workings of ai, but also related to the community context where norms, practices, values, and knowledge are cultivated along the use of ai. explanation is human activity that is socially, culturally, and historically situated. an at lens that pays attention to contradictions and balanced states is invaluable in understanding and designing sustainable social systems of community-ai interaction.",967
"Spontaneous, Yet Studious: Esports Commentators' Live Performance and Self-Presentation Practices",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415174,"esports commentating, the practice of reporting, explaining, and elaborating live competitive gameplay to spectators, is a centerpiece of esports as a rapidly growing spectator sport and an essential component of today's growing gaming/live streaming ecosystem. in particular, esports commentators face three unique challenges: the preparation for conducting real time commentating on highly dynamic esports games; the complexity of in-the-moment decisions during the game's broadcast; and the balance between personal self-presentation and professional content presentation. yet this emerging and novel sociotechnical practice and how these challenges affect esports commentators' live performance and self-presentation practices has received relatively little research attention in hci and cscw. in this paper, we endeavor to address these limitations by empirically analyzing 19 esports commentators' sociotechnical practices. our findings highlight the complex interaction dynamics involved in esports commentating as well as the importance of professionalism and social presence in esports commentators' self-presentation. in order to execute seamless and spontaneous commentary, commentators must be studious and engage in much prior research and have a clear sense of self. we contribute to the growing cscw literature on esports commentating practices by revealing esports commentators' unique decision making process presenting information and their self-image. as esports commentating is increasingly transforming how people experience traditional sports commentating, gaming, and live streaming simultaneously, how would esports commentators prepare and manage such novel and complicated practices? and what are their strategies to present themselves in this complex ecosystem consisting of players, co-commentators, viewers, and technology? in this study, we endeavor to explore these questions by understanding 1) how esports commentators prepare for their live streaming in terms of aesthetics, physical function, and game knowledge; 2) methods they employ to choose what information to focus on during casting; and 3) their unique considerations when presenting themselves online. especially, we highlight the complex interaction dynamics involved in esports commentating, which points to the need for future research to reconsider the role of interactivity in live streaming. our insights on the importance of professionalism and social presence in esports commentators’ self-presentation may also lead to potential new perspectives to study self-presentation online – by taking the specific subculture where one belongs to and the co-presenters (not just audience) into account. therefore, we contribute to the growing cscw literature on esports commentating and live streaming by revealing esports commentators’ unique decision making process for streaming and self-presentation. our focus on esports commentating, an understudied sociotechnical practice, also offers new empirical evidence of nuanced self-presentation practices afforded by emerging technology.",968
"Party Politics, Values and the Design of Social Media Services: Implications of political elites' values and ideologies to mitigating of political polarisation through design",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415175,"there have been several attempts to support political engagement through novel social media services. while the political nature of any technologies is widely acknowledged in human-computer interaction, such considerations have been less studied when designing for political engagement in social media services. we used speculative design probes to gauge how political elites perceive alternative social media interfaces designed to increase media diversity and decrease political polarisation. we show how elites? reactions to design probes could be rooted into party ideologies. based on these, we discuss directions how social media services could be designed. our underlying contribution is wider. we show how studying elites can provide insights about politics embedded into proposed novel social media services for political engagement. second, we demonstrate what elites? perspective provide fruitful way to expand and rethink concepts that have been used to study ordinary people before. finally, we discuss potential challenges of replacing economic interests with political interest in social media service design and provide a richer account on the discussion about social media regulation. therefore, we pave the way to more research to critically study elites within social computing scholarship and highlight the importance of understanding political motivations which can guide the development of social media. our work acknowledged that generally human–computer interaction scholars acknowledge that values are embedded to any technologies they developed [80, 111] and have developed several approaches to account for this in their work [e.g., value-sensitive, participatory and speculative design approaches; 11, 14, 34, 49, 70, 112]. however, when human–computer interaction scholars design systems for political participation and engagement, these critical considerations are less prominently present. in this work, we identified how politics may present itself in these domains and discussed the democratic implications of these, our analysis shows that political values and ideologies can be seen in reactions to both to exact delivery mechanisms as well as deeper underlying values technologies may manifest. for example, some members of political elites preferred more paternalistic values while others highlighted the importance of freedom. second, we suggested that studying political elites instead of (ordinary) users provides insights which may help to move theoretic discussion forward. based on our results, we discuss how challenging landscape designing for politics is given the diverging values in society and discuss challenges and benefits of particular design directions. our results provide a starting point to balance the discussion on design of social media platforms. today, many discussants highlight that platforms’ economic interests drive their choices and ask for alternative approaches. however, involving governments regulation directly could make the design open for political interests. these discussions invite additional scholarship on potential design approaches which consider the party politics as well as more empirical research on political ideologies in the design and acceptability of digital systems.",969
"""I Hope This Is Helpful"": Understanding Crowdworkers' Challenges and Motivations for an Image Description Task",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415176,"ai image captioning challenges encourage broad participation in designing algorithms that automatically create captions for a variety of images and users. to create large datasets necessary for these challenges, researchers typically employ a shared crowdsourcing task design for image captioning. this paper discusses findings from our thematic analysis of 1,064 comments left by amazon mechanical turk workers using this task design to create captions for images taken by people who are blind. workers discussed difficulties in understanding how to complete this task, provided suggestions of how to improve the task, gave explanations or clarifications about their work, and described why they found this particular task rewarding or interesting. our analysis provides insights both into this particular genre of task as well as broader considerations for how to employ crowdsourcing to generate large datasets for developing ai algorithms. in the pursuit of automated ai solutions to scale up impact, we should not forget about the crowdsourced labor currently working ""behind the scenes"" to generate large datasets. while human crowdworkers are well suited to contribute, they understandably would like significant context for navigating the complexity of subjectivity in performing the tasks. our findings are relevant both to improving the quality of the data generated by such tasks, as well as to improving the experience for workers. better supporting crowdworkers in performing such tasks is not only an ethically and socially valuable goal in itself, but helping them to do better work can also create a virtuous cycle [96] whereby workers will be encouraged (and will encourage others) to continue successfully performing similar tasks in the future. looking beyond the specific area of image captioning, the approach of integrating worker feedback as a necessary step in dataset creation can potentially be generalized to a variety of fields. complementary ways for future work to solicit worker feedback include employing detailed ethnographic and observational studies of workers in order to generate real-time data about their experiences, as well as developing large-scale surveys to gain additional understanding of workers’ experiences. ultimately, refining the design of such tasks to better support workers’ needs and goals can allow them to ""do their best,"" especially when workers ""hope [their work] is helpful.""",970
Leveraging Peer Support for Mature Immigrants Learning to Write in Informal Contexts,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415177,"for adult newcomers to countries such as canada, learning language is more than an academic task. language proficiency is their gateway to long-term economic and social stability, but limited access to resources contributes to systemic inequities which disproportionately place immigrants at socioeconomic disadvantages. many new immigrants rely heavily on informal peer-networks to pursue avenues of success within an unfamiliar and inadequate system. to explore how we could leverage such a peer-based approach to meet their needs for feedback and support when learning to write in english, we deployed a peer-based writing app with 16 participants. post-deployment focus groups and analysis of writing artifacts reveal that the design of writing support tools should present transparent feedback from both peers and automated sources, foster community through semi-structured discussions, incorporate guided review, and scaffold affective development. we discuss how incorporating these elements into the design of community learning platforms can address the language literacy needs of diverse immigrant learners and foster more positive experiences for newcomers as they negotiate their evolving identities. highly-skilled immigrants often face a challenging search for employment and community, and are at high risk of facing social, cultural, and economic marginalization. formal structures frequently fail to provide adequate support in preparing new immigrants, especially those no longer in school, for achieving their goals. turning to the community for support has the potential to overcome the systemic barriers to success that these immigrants face. our research focused on immigrants to canada. however, many of the peer learning aspects are likely generalizable to other industrialized countries that have a similar skilled worker entry program for accepting highly educated immigrants. we explored the viability of peer-review based writing support tools to provide long-term support in informal learning contexts. we conducted an “in-the-wild” evaluation of a collaborative learning tool for mature ells to understand both their performance and their perceptions of the peer-review process. from this we drew guidelines for developing a groupbased peer-review network rather than a dyadic peer review system. from our findings, we suggest three recommendations for designers of writing support tools for sustainable, semi-autonomous learning environments. we suggest mature ells should be presented with feedback from diverse sources where the justification is transparent, community should be fostered through open-ended discussion rather than imposing a formal structure for the peer-review, and finally, localized guidance is required for improving both technical and affective skills. for newcomers to a country, the process of learning language is also a process of reshaping identity and developing a sense of self within a new community [31]. therefore, design for language learning should consider the wider, postcolonial context in which the language acquisition is situated [30]. we found that our mature ells are not “students” in the traditional sense, but rather, they are invested life-long learners who actively pursue new skills that bring them closer to their goals. as such, language learning tools should also foster positive selfgrowth. mature ells should feel confident in making mistakes, providing honest feedback, and engaging in collaborative knowledge building in these spaces. when formal structures are unable to provide new immigrants with necessary resources, a collaborative learning platform that incorporates our guidelines can promote the reciprocal sharing of language learning guidance by leveraging skills within a network of peers.",971
Reconsidering Self-Moderation: the Role of Research in Supporting Community-Based Models for Online Content Moderation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415178,"research in online content moderation has a long history of exploring different forms that moderation can take, including both user-driven moderation models on community-based platforms like wikipedia, facebook groups, and reddit, and centralized corporate moderation models on platforms like twitter and instagram. in this work i review different approaches to moderation research with the goal of providing a roadmap for researchers studying community self-moderation. i contrast community-based moderation research with platforms and policies-focused moderation research, and argue that the former has an important role to play in shaping discussions about the future of online moderation. i provide six guiding questions for future research that, if answered, can support the development of a form of user-driven moderation that is widely implementable across a variety of social spaces online, offering an alternative to the corporate moderation models that dominate public debate and discussion. though how facebook and other platforms impact public discourse is far from a settled question, these authors’ central points are fair; the moderation of public discourse under a centralized, profit-driven system deserves heavy scrutiny. whether these models can truly achieve the values of transparency and accountability that have been articulated as goals for their future remains to be seen. as i have argued throughout this paper, though many recent, well-received pieces of research have focused exclusively on platform-driven moderation without considering alternative moderation models, the platform-driven model should not be treated as an inevitable outcome of the current trends; there are many forms of moderation that do not fall under this centralized model, and many of these systems already exist and have seen significant success. the modern world of social media, in its current, centrally-moderated form, is certainly not the internet-facilitated utopia that we were promised, but an open-minded reconsideration of the core structures of the modern internet may lead us toward viable alternatives.",972
Exploring Antecedents and Consequences of Toxicity in Online Discussions: A Case Study on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415179,"toxicity in online discussions has been an intriguing phenomenon and an important problem. in this paper, we seek to better understand toxicity dynamics in online discussions via a case study on reddit that explores the antecedents and consequences of toxicity in text. we inspected two dimensions of toxicity: language toxicity, i.e. how toxic the text itself is; and toxicity elicitation, i.e. how much toxicity it elicits in its response. through regression analyses on reddit comments, we found that both author propensity and toxicity in discussion context were strong positive antecedents of language toxicity; meanwhile, language toxicity significantly increased the volume and user evaluation of the discussion in some sub-communities, while toxicity elicitation showed mixed effects. we then discuss how our results help understand and regulate toxicity in online discussions by interpreting the complicated triggers and outcomes of toxicity. we presented a study that explored the antecedents and consequences of toxicity – specifically language toxicity and toxicity elicitation – in online discussions, via quantitative analysis on reddit comments. we found both author propensity and toxicity in discussion context to be strong antecedents of toxicity, and the volume and user evaluation of discussion to be positively correlated with language toxicity in some sub-communities. our interpretation of the complicated triggers and outcomes of toxicity as well as the discussion of design implications should help understand and regulate toxicity in online discussions.",973
Supporting Youth Activists? Strategic Use of Social Media: A Qualitative Investigation of Design Opportunities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415180,"social networking sites (sns) provide a platform for engaging youth in activism (e.g., by helping mobilize civic action). while youth typically employ casual approaches to online activism (i.e., quick actions, such as broadcast posts to advertise social justice events), more strategic practices (i.e., those that are more creative and informed) can increase the likelihood of successful online campaigns. however, little work has examined how youth activists can be supported to use sns more strategically. to address this research gap, we conducted interviews with youth activists, exploring how youth made sense of social network visualizations and their perspectives on how such tools could support their activism efforts. our findings characterize how participants made inferences about followers? identities based on their hashtag use, and how they used those inferences in outreach decisions. we conclude with design implications for future research in this area. youth activism online presents opportunities for youth development and for the voice of youth to be heard. however, to have impactful participation online, it is important to provide youth with tools to use sns in strategic ways. our study is a stepping stone for work that aims to create tools that help youth strategically navigate the social capital available in their network. our findings revealed the importance of visualizing hashtag usage, as a means of supporting youth activists’ decision-making. future research should explore other aspects of one’s network that might impact such decision making. one area in need of further research is the study of opportunities and challenges that the deployment of such tools over a prolonged period may present. such work is necessary for a better understanding of how to augment youth’ experience using sns for activism.",974
CrowdCog: A Cognitive Skill based System for Heterogeneous Task Assignment and Recommendation in Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415181,"while crowd workers typically complete a variety of tasks in crowdsourcing platforms, there is no widely accepted method to successfully match workers to different types of tasks. researchers have considered using worker demographics, behavioural traces, and prior task completion records to optimise task assignment. however, optimum task assignment remains a challenging research problem due to limitations of proposed approaches, which in turn can have a significant impact on the future of crowdsourcing. we present 'crowdcog', an online dynamic system that performs both task assignment and task recommendations, by relying on fast-paced online cognitive tests to estimate worker performance across a variety of tasks. our work extends prior work that highlights the effect of workers' cognitive ability on crowdsourcing task performance. our study, deployed on amazon mechanical turk, involved 574 workers and 983 hits that span across four typical crowd tasks (classification, counting, transcription, and sentiment analysis). our results show that both our assignment method and recommendation method result in a significant performance increase (5% to 20%) as compared to a generic or random task assignment. our findings pave the way for the use of quick cognitive tests to provide robust recommendations and assignments to crowd workers. in this paper, we study the heterogeneous task assignment problem through a novel and online assignment and recommendation method. we propose the use of short online cognitive tests for dynamic task assignment in a crowdsourcing platform across a variety of tasks. we built the crowdcog system by integrating our novel task assignment and recommendation framework with mturk. we evaluate the system using a real world study involving 574 crowd workers and 983 hits across four tasks. our study compares the proposed task assignment and task recommendation methods with a baseline generic task assignment and reports significantly higher task accuracy in both cases. we also show proc. acm hum.-comput. interact., vol. 4, no. cscw2, article 110. publication date: october 2020. crowdcog 110:19 that the proposed methods are comparable in improving worker’s task accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art question assignment methods as well as a standard history-based qualification. at the same time, our method has a number of additional advantages, such as applicability to a variety of different tasks, not relying on historical performance data, and a better person-job fit which has been shown to lead to higher worker satisfaction [19]. future work could explore a selection mechanism that takes into account the current task availability and cognitive test completion of the worker to further enhance the efficiency and productivity of the proposed method. furthermore, once we have a list of eligible tasks for a worker, we randomly select a task from the list as opposed to the use of an optimised selection method. while this selection is less likely to impact the accuracy, an informed selection at this stage could further improve the efficiency of the data collection process. however, as both these enhancements dependent on various factors, future work in this domain will require a carefully crafted study design to account for the added complexity. in addition, a longitudinal study which investigates the frequency with which the cognitive tests should be repeated and the strategies for reusing cognitive tests will further strengthen the applicability of our findings.",975
Sochiatrist: Signals of Affect in Messaging Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415182,"messaging is a common mode of communication, with conversations written informally between individuals. interpreting emotional affect from messaging data can lead to a powerful form of reflection or act as a support for clinical therapy. existing analysis techniques for social media commonly use liwc and vader for automated sentiment estimation. we correlate liwc, vader, and ratings from human reviewers with affect scores from 25 participants. we explore differences in how and when each technique is successful. results show that human review does better than vader, the best automated technique, when humans are judging positive affect ($r_s=0.45$ correlation when confident, $r_s=0.30$ overall). surprisingly, human reviewers only do slightly better than vader when judging negative affect ($r_s=0.38$ correlation when confident, $r_s=0.29$ overall). compared to prior literature, vader correlates more closely with panas scores for private messaging than public social media. our results indicate that while any technique that serves as a proxy for panas scores has moderate correlation at best, there are some areas to improve the automated techniques by better considering context and timing in conversations. in this paper, we investigated the ability for sentiment analysis techniques to find an emotional signal in messaging data. human review, especially when the reviewers were confident, had the highest correlation with panas, while vader achieved similar correlation for negative affect. vader, outperforming liwc, is reasonably accurate for predicting affect, but does so differently than human review, as the correlation between the two is low. both human review and vader performed well on messaging data in comparison to past studies, most of which used public social media data. vader’s relatively strong performance when using messaging data supports a more in depth investigation of the difference between private messages and public social media posts. however, it should be noted that all correlations with panas, while many were significant, had only moderate strength at best. we would caution against treating any of these methods as a replacement for user-reported affect data gathered through panas. what is perhaps most promising in the future is identifying the parts of human review that the automated techniques perform poorly in. due to the evidence that human reviewers have the ability to gauge when they are likely more accurate, there must be some explanatory signal that the current automated techniques are not yet catching. human reviewers are able to interpret both context and timing, and moderate the message based on the social relationship, likely playing a role in this. these discrepancies indicate opportunities for better sentiment analysis in the future, which could feature measures that are currently only noticed by humans.",976
The Patient Advice System: A Technology Probe Study to Enable Peer Support in the Hospital,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415183,"although peer support technologies are critical resources for patients managing health conditions, they do not address the needs of patients in the hospital (i.e., inpatients) or the unique design constraints of this healthcare setting. to examine how the design of these technologies can meet the needs of inpatients, we conducted a technology probe study with 30 pediatric and adult inpatients. we created the patient advice system (pas) to enable peer support in the hospital setting, then studied how participants used and perceived it during their stay. inpatients used the pas to exchange emotional support and share peer advice on a range of topics (e.g., adjusting to the hospital, communicating with providers). they identified several benefits (e.g., fostered connections) and challenges (e.g., competing clinical priorities) with using the pas in the real-world context of their hospital stay. based on our findings, we discuss three design opportunities-highlighting local expertise, designing for dynamic engagement, and providing alternative modes of peer support-for future peer support technologies to empower inpatients and overcome the difficulties they face within the hospital. we present a technology probe study we conducted to explore inpatients’ use and perception of the pas, an in-hospital peer support technology probe. we found that participants adopted different user roles—including storytellers, commenters, and upvoters—on the pas. pediatric and adult participants formed distinct social interaction patterns based on their use of commenting and upvoting features. these participants exchanged informational and emotional support on a range of topics, such as adjusting to the hospital, understanding their care, and preventing and reporting medical errors. furthermore, we describe factors, like fostered peer connections and competing clinical priorities, that helped and hindered inpatients’ use of the pas during their hospital stay. we discuss three novel design opportunities: (1) highlighting local expertise, (2) designing for dynamic engagement, and (3) providing alternative modes of peer support. these insights provide guidance for future inpatient peer support technologies to increase inpatients’ knowledge, self-efficacy, and empowerment during their hospital stay.",977

Understanding the Role of Intermediaries in Online Social E-commerce: An Exploratory Study of Beidian,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415185,"social e-commerce, as a new form of social computing based marketing platforms, utilizes existing real-world social relationships for promotions and sales of products. it has been growing rapidly in recent years and attracted tens of millions of users in china. a key group of actors who enable market transactions on these platforms are intermediaries who connect producers with consumers by sharing information with and recommending products to their real-world social contacts. despite their crucial role, the nature and behavior of these intermediaries on these social e-commerce platforms has not been systematically analyzed. here we address this knowledge gap through a mixed method study. leveraging 9 months' all-round behavior of about 40 million users on beidian -- one of the largest social e-commerce sites in china, alongside with qualitative evidence from online forums and interviews, we examine characteristics of intermediaries, identify their behavioral patterns and uncover strategies and mechanisms that make successful intermediaries. we demonstrate that intermediaries on social e-commerce sites act as local trend detectors and ""social grocers''. furthermore, successful intermediaries are highly dedicated whenever best sellers appear and broaden items for promotion. to the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first large-scale analysis on the emerging role of intermediaries in social e-commerce platforms, which provides potential insights for the design and management of social computing marketing platforms. this paper presents the first analysis on the role of intermediaries in social e-commerce through the combination of quantitative explorations and qualitative analysis. we highlight characteristics of intermediaries, identify successful intermediaries and analyze factors contributing to becoming successful intermediaries. we demonstrate that they take the role of 1) detecting and promoting local trends; and 2) selling in a convenience-store manner to socially-connected consumers. we show that to become more successful intermediaries, one should actively devote to promoting best sellers and broaden their sales in a social grocer manner. our work points to the interesting nature of behaviors and sales on this new form of social e-commerce, which contributes to a better understanding of computer-supported cooperative work and social computing based marketing platforms.",979
Between Subjectivity and Imposition: Power Dynamics in Data Annotation for Computer Vision,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415186,"the interpretation of data is fundamental to machine learning. this paper investigates practices of image data annotation as performed in industrial contexts. we define data annotation as a sense-making practice, where annotators assign meaning to data through the use of labels. previous human-centered investigations have largely focused on annotators? subjectivity as a major cause of biased labels. we propose a wider view on this issue: guided by constructivist grounded theory, we conducted several weeks of fieldwork at two annotation companies. we analyzed which structures, power relations, and naturalized impositions shape the interpretation of data. our results show that the work of annotators is profoundly informed by the interests, values, and priorities of other actors above their station. arbitrary classifications are vertically imposed on annotators, and through them, on data. this imposition is largely naturalized. assigning meaning to data is often presented as a technical matter. this paper shows it is, in fact, an exercise of power with multiple implications for individuals and society. this paper has presented a constructivist grounded theory investigation of the sensemaking of data as performed by data annotators. based on several weeks of fieldwork at two companies and interviews with annotators, managers, and computer vision practitioners, we have described structures and standards that influence the classification and labeling of data. we aimed at contesting the supposed neutrality of data-driven systems by setting the spotlight on the power dynamics that inform data creation. we found that workers’ subjectivity is structurally constrained and profoundly shaped by classifications imposed by actors above annotators’ station. briefings, annotation guidelines, and quality control all aim at meeting the demands of clients and the market. we have argued that the creation of datasets follows the logics of cost effectiveness, optimization of workers’ output, and standardization of labels, often at the expense of ethical considerations. we have observed the presence of multiple instances of classification, with diverse actors among several hierarchical layers that are related to the possession of capital. we have argued that the many layers, actors, and iterations involved contribute to the imposition of meaning and, finally, to the dilution of responsibilities and accountability for the possible harms caused by arbitrary labels. furthermore, our findings have shown that workers naturalize the imposed classifications as well as the epistemic authority of those actors higher in the hierarchy. our observations indicate that power asymmetries, which are inherent to labor relations and to the service relationship between annotation companies and their clients, fundamentally shape labels, datasets, and systems. we have furthermore discussed implications for practitioners and researchers and advocated for the adoption of a power-aware perspective to document actors and rationale behind the meanings assigned to data in annotation work. finally, we have emphasized the importance of adopting a similar power-aware perspective in the cscw research agenda, not only as a possible focus for future work but also as a tool for reflecting on researchers’ own position and power.",980
Tangible Privacy: Towards User-Centric Sensor Designs for Bystander Privacy,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415187,"sensor-enabled computers in the form of 'iot' devices such as home security cameras and voice assistants are increasingly becoming pervasive in our environment. with the embedded cameras and microphones in these devices, this 'invasion' of our everyday spaces can pose significant threats to the privacy of bystanders. because of their complex functionality, even when people attempt privacy measures (such as asking the owner to ""turn the camera off""), these devices may still record information because of the lack of a 'real' off button. with the ambiguities of current designs, a bystander's perceived privacy can diverge from their actual privacy. indeed, being able to assess one's actual privacy is a key aspect in managing one's privacy according to altman's theory of boundary regulation, and current designs fall short in assuring people of their privacy. to understand how people as bystanders manage their privacy with iot devices, we conducted an interview study about people's perceptions of and behaviors around current iot devices. we find that although participants' behaviors line up with altman's theory of boundary regulation, in the face of uncertainty about their privacy, they desire or engage in various 'tangible' workarounds. based on our findings, we identify and introduce the concept of 'tangible privacy' as being essential to boundary regulation with iot devices. we argue that iot devices should be designed in a way that clearly and unambiguously conveys sensor states to people around them and make actionable design recommendations to provide strong privacy assurances to bystanders. based on our study of how people manage their privacy around iot devices, we identify and introduce the concept of ‘tangible privacy’ as an important consideration in the design of iot devices. tangible privacy mechanisms provide people with a way to clearly and unambiguously control and discern privacy states of iot devices in their vicinity. current designs do not provide adequate assurances to bystanders, who are unable to clearly ascertain whether they are being recorded by a camera or microphone. through our interview study, we find that current designs lead to an uncertainty about device states (e.g., whether they are indeed ‘on’ or ‘off’ or in some intermediate ‘stand-by’ state and able to record data) and confusion about features such as what leds mean. this uncertainty, along with the mistrust of software controls, also lead people to improvise their own privacy mechanisms such as covering cameras with other objects and even attempting to muffle microphones. we also found that people can underestimate their privacy risks by overly focusing on the primary function of the device and sometimes not being aware of microphones on video-focused iot devices and vice versa. a major contribution of our work is the call for adopting hardware mechanisms in an attempt to provide bystanders with the required assurance of their privacy. our findings inspire various design principles for the design of future iot devices. designers should strive to design mechanisms that provide clear and unambiguous feedback through ‘tangible privacy’ mechanisms. their devices should convey clarity on their ‘on’/‘off’ states, and designers should recognize the limitations of leds (they should be seen as necessary but not sufficient). cameras should support shutter mechanisms for obscuring the camera, and microphones, in particular, need special attention because their current embedded designs do not seem to offer any easy ways of being obscured. future microphones need to be designed so that they can be easily – and tangibly – disabled on devices. future, novel designs could consider modular designs where sensors can be easily removed or reattached based on people’s privacy preferences. finally, iot devices should support a negotiation of privacy between people in the vicinity. although much work has studied such privacy negotiation, more research is needed on how devices can be reconfigured for tangibility. overall, we hope that our work inspires future research on designs for ‘tangible privacy’, which we posit is a necessary component for managing privacy in today’s socio-technical physical spaces.",981
A Seat at the Table: Black Feminist Thought as a Critical Framework for Inclusive Game Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415188,"game-based second language (l2) learning represents an ideal alternative to foreign language classroom instruction. however, despite a diverse player demographic, the design of l2 games is often not informed by players representative of marginalized populations, especially women of color (i.e., black women). such oversight in the design process contributes to games that perpetuate gendered and racist stereotypes, and therefore, are less appealing to women of color. in response this dilemma, we utilize black feminist thought (bft) as a critical framework to engage black women, a marginalized and understudied population within the gaming subculture, and more broadly, the computer supported cooperative work (cscw) community in game design. twenty-five black women take on multiple roles as game designers, foreign language instructor, and informants who represent both producers and consumers throughout the conceptualization phase of a l2 mobile game prototype. applying bft principles, we leverage black women\textquotesingle s lived intersectional experiences to transform the traditional game design process into a more inclusive design experience for black women. in the context of games that support l2 learning, our findings reveal that black women appreciate games that: 1. provide authentic cultural experiences; 2. feature intersectional game characters that reflect real life experiences; 3. accurately portray the diversity of black women's bodies; and 4. provide opportunities for players to customize game assets. as a disruptor to traditional game design, bft makes salient oppressive design practices within the gaming culture that also extend to the larger cscw community, signifying the need to embrace more inclusive design practices that benefit black women and other marginalized populations. we apply black feminist thought (bft) as a critical framework to engage black women in the co-design process of the l2 mobile game ""bienvenido a mi cocina!"" - ""welcome to my kitchen!"", a game designed to promote spanish vocabulary acquisition. bft, as a framework for inclusive game design, leverages the historical legacy and agency of black women in the united states, positioning them front and center in the discourse about their intersectional experiences. black women game designers relied on sociocultural norms (i.e., black women sitting and talking around the kitchen table) to inform the initial design of the l2 game prototype. as informants, black women generated several suggestions, including more accurately representing the diversity of black women’s bodies in black women game characters, game options that promote customization of game assets, and additional game characters that reflect intersectional experiences of race, gender, sexuality and nationality indicative of spanish speaking populations. finally, it is not enough to simply engage black women in game design. bft, as a critical framework that promotes inclusivity, requires us to address the very social injustices that affect black women and other marginalized population who are often overlooked in the early stages of game design or only considered when evaluating or playtesting games. instead, we invite those interested in designing games that appeal to a broad player demographic to seek out black women as a valuable segment of the player population, developing an appreciation for our unique perspective. such efforts will begin to address the systemic oppression of black women in gaming and contribute towards a more inclusive gaming subculture and cscw community.",982
Chatbot-based Emotion Management for Distributed Teams: A Participatory Design Study,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415189,"fueled by the pervasion of tools like slack or microsoft teams, the usage of text-based communication in distributed teams has grown massively in organizations. this brings distributed teams many advantages, however, a critical shortcoming in these setups is the decreased ability of perceiving, understanding and regulating emotions. this is problematic because better team members? abilities of emotion management positively impact team-level outcomes like team cohesion and team performance, while poor abilities diminish communication flow and well-being. leveraging chatbot technology in distributed teams has been recognized as a promising approach to reintroduce and improve upon these abilities. in this article we present three chatbot designs for emotion management for distributed teams. in order to develop these designs, we conducted three participatory design workshops which resulted in 153 sketches. subsequently, we evaluated the designs following an exploratory evaluation with 27 participants. results show general stimulating effects on emotion awareness and communication efficiency. further, they report emotion regulation and increased compromise facilitation through social and interactive design features, but also perceived threats like loss of control. with some design features adversely impacting emotion management, we highlight design implications and discuss chatbot design recommendations for enhancing emotion management in teams. in this study we conducted the design, implementation, and evaluation of chatbot-based em in text-based communication for distributed teams. based on participatory design workshops we developed three chatbot designs: neutralbot, neutrally reporting, socialbot, anthropomorphic and socially engaging, and actionbot, actively intervening. we evaluated the designs in a mixed-method laboratory experiment with 27 participants. the findings report stimulation of emotion awareness and communication efficiency through all chatbot designs, and especially an increase in emotion regulation and compromise facilitation through social (sbt) and interactive (abt) design features. these design features were appreciated, however, for all designs situating constraints limit the effectiveness, e.g. contextual factors (timing, accuracy, time-pressure), too obtrusive interventions (content deletion, large images), and too neutral messages (missing explanations) were confusing and disturbing. thereby, a combination of design features makes sense to improve positive effects and mitigate potential downsides. besides positive results, we found support for threats by chatbots through perceived surveillance and loss of control. concluding remarks regarding covid-19. the importance of these findings should be critically appraised against the backdrop of present societal changes. since distancing measures due to the covid-19 pandemic have taken effect, the global workforce has vitally relied on collaboration software (e.g. slack, microsoft teams). as our work is closely related, we present a few concluding thoughts about the opportunities of chatbot-based em in this new future of work. in the past months, home-office work configurations have been pivotal and they have been accompanied by a series of challenging developments in terms of emotional experiences (e.g. [7, 51]). some developments stand out: with primarily remote collaboration, communication exchange becomes shorter (cf. [52]) and focuses towards mandatory, official meetings. in consequence, individual isolation appears to increase since social-emotional communication might decrease. this may lead to psychologically detrimental experiences like loneliness as well as impaired leadership. for the future of collaborative software it requires to counterbalance this structural change. chatbot-based em could provide means for this by strengthening social bonds in distributed teams, for example through providing space for traversing missing emotional information and diminishing emotional shortcomings. further, reduced or artificial social interaction may lead to emotional disengagement from work. with this development the motivation to collaborate might shrink, too. therefore, chatbots with emotional capabilities could provide a mean to positively influence work motivation in distributed teams. in summary we propose, that many of the presently unfolding challenges for the now broader remote workforce are related to social interaction and, thereby, to em. chatbot-based em support mechanisms could therefore play a vital role in making the shift from artificial and cold virtual interaction to an emotionally rich and functional digital workplace of the future.",983
Studying Politeness across Cultures using English Twitter and Mandarin Weibo,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415190,"modeling politeness across cultures helps to improve intercultural communication by uncovering what is considered appropriate and polite. we study the linguistic features associated with politeness across american english and mandarin chinese. first, we annotate 5,300 twitter posts from the united states (us) and 5,300 sina weibo posts from china for politeness scores. next, we develop an english and chinese politeness feature set, 'politelex'. combining it with validated psycholinguistic dictionaries, we study the correlations between linguistic features and perceived politeness across cultures. we find that on mandarin weibo, future-focusing conversations, identifying with a group affiliation, and gratitude are considered more polite compared to english twitter. death-related taboo topics, use of pronouns (with the exception of honorifics), and informal language are associated with higher impoliteness on mandarin weibo than on english twitter. finally, we build language-based machine learning models to predict politeness with an f1 score of 0.886 on mandarin weibo and 0.774 on english twitter. in this paper, we showed that politelex, combined with liwc and emolex, can outperform the stanford api [11] in predicting politeness on social media corpus and the stanford politeness corpus [11]. we also studied the similarities and differences in politeness expressions across english twitter and mandarin weibo and found several categories of politelex to be significantly associated with politeness on both platforms. several correlations mapped onto known psycho-social differences across us and chinese cultures. for example, use of all pronouns (except honorifics) highly correlates with impoliteness in weibo, echoing the fact that chinese is a pro-drop language, one that frequently omits pronouns [24]. on weibo, future-focusing conversations, identifying with a group affiliation, and gratitude are considered to be polite compared to english twitter. death-related taboo topics and informal language are associated with higher impoliteness on mandarin weibo compared to english twitter.",984
Advisory Service Support that Works: Enhancing Service Quality with a Mixed-reality System,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415191,"modern information technology promises to improve service encounters through automated documentation or better decision traceability. at the same time, research suggests a negative impact of technology on human-to-human advisory services: including the possibility that computers might degrade the quality of interpersonal communication and reinforce unpleasant behaviors. consequently, despite obvious improvements, information technology might have a negative impact on how the participants perceive the service. this might imply serious consequences for the service provider: dissatisfied clients, ineffective information exchange, and/or lack of transparency. this scenario slows down the diffusion of computers into advisory services in banks and insurance companies, and so designing systems for use in interpersonal services remains a challenge. this article provides evidence that livepaper, a system designed alongside the material practices of a financial advisory encounter, helps to improve important service quality dimensions, making the services not only more pleasant for the participants, but also improving key marketing and business metrics of the service. in experimental advisory services, the sessions supported with livepaper outperformed conventional services with regard to overall bank service quality and satisfaction, salesperson listening and interaction rating scores, as well as information transparency. this shows that a carefully designed system not only preserves the perceived quality of a service, but might improve it objectively, and has implications for the marketing and business value of the service. in summary, the current study offers a major improvement concerning the support of advisory services in financial institutions and beyond. we claim that livepaper can be used as a framework for further, focused applications addressing more specific challenges in the advisory scenario without the risk of disrupting the interpersonal relationship or making the encounter lack transparency, or simply be less satisfactory for the client. however, the frontline service scenario bears potential for further cscw research: artificial intelligence is expected to change the way services are provided, yet the vision of a robot as a frontline employee is strange or inadequate for many clients. livepaper offers a way to combine the potential of current-stage artificial intelligence (quick fact checking, generation of multiple scenarios and predictions) with a fully-fledged interpersonal encounter. in an era of self-service and robo advisors, a premium frontline experience combining human-to-human and human-to-machine collaboration might be an important asset. however, it remains unclear how clients will perceive such hybrid encounters, how the roles should be distributed between human and non-human actors, and what rituals should be supported and how. we claim that interpersonal services will not disappear, but their character will necessarily change and cscw is predestined to go along with the transformation while attending to the effects on humans, the organization, and society.",985
Middle-Aged Video Consumers' Beliefs About Algorithmic Recommendations on YouTube,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415192,"user beliefs about algorithmic systems are constantly co-produced through user interaction and the complex socio-technical systems that generate recommendations. identifying these beliefs is crucial because they influence how users interact with recommendation algorithms. with no prior work on user beliefs of algorithmic video recommendations, practitioners lack relevant knowledge to improve the user experience of such systems. to address this problem, we conducted semi-structured interviews with middle-aged youtube video consumers to analyze their user beliefs about the video recommendation system. our analysis revealed different factors that users believe influence their recommendations. based on these factors, we identified four groups of user beliefs: previous actions, social media, recommender system, and company policy. additionally, we propose a framework to distinguish the four main actors that users believe influence their video recommendations: the current user, other users, the algorithm, and the organization. this framework provides a new lens to explore design suggestions based on the agency of these four actors. it also exposes a novel aspect previously unexplored: the effect of corporate decisions on the interaction with algorithmic recommendations. while we found that users are aware of the existence of the recommendation system on youtube, we show that their understanding of this system is limited. this paper presents the first overview of middle-aged video consumers’ beliefs about youtube’s algorithmic video recommendations. the analysis identified four groups of user beliefs that describe how users understand video recommendations on youtube: previous actions, social media, recommender system, and company policy. for each user belief, we identified several influence factors recognized by users which could help designers improve the experience of video recommendations. to enable solutions to this problem, we systematically analyzed the different influence factors and identified four dominant user beliefs that we relate to different actors. users recognize these influences without having a background in technology. we invite further studies on the complex socio-technical context of recommender systems using this framework, including how the organization that operates the recommendation system influences the user experience with the recommendations.",986
A Dramaturgical Approach to Online Activism within Youth Empowerment Organizations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415193,"social networking sites (sns) offer youth activists and youth empowerment organizations (where adults help youth address community issues) opportunities for civic action. impression management is critical to youth empowerment organizations' work online, as they attempt to influence the opinions of their audience. however, there is a dearth of research characterizing online impression management in the context of youth empowerment organizations. to address this research gap, we conducted a qualitative study investigating the use of sns in a youth empowerment organization. using goffman's dramaturgical model, we characterized how youth tried to hack sns algorithms, and their desire to better identify their audience. our findings reveal how youth use sns to create authentic images and connections with their audience. on the other hand, we discuss adults' desire to convey a curated organizational image and challenges that arose. we conclude with design implications for tools that support impression management online for youth activists. in this study, we examined the activist work of a youth empowerment organization through goffman’s dramaturgical framework. we specifically explored how these organizations engaged in impression management on sns. our findings revealed the challenges staff members faced in creating a planned and unified front stage for the organization. additionally, we characterized youth’s desire to connect to their audiences through the use of various social networking features and their desire to learn about their audience. we finally presented recommendations for future studies to explore how interventions could support the work of youth activists on sns (e.g., exploring the role of collective impression management within youth empowerment organizations).",987
From Lost to Found: Discover Missing UI Design Semantics through Recovering Missing Tags,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415194,"design sharing sites provide ui designers with a platform to share their works and also an opportunity to get inspiration from others' designs. to facilitate management and search of millions of ui design images, many design sharing sites adopt collaborative tagging systems by distributing the work of categorization to the community. however, designers often do not know how to properly tag one design image with compact textual description, resulting in unclear, incomplete, and inconsistent tags for uploaded examples which impede retrieval, according to our empirical study and interview with four professional designers. based on a deep neural network, we introduce a novel approach for encoding both the visual and textual information to recover the missing tags for existing ui examples so that they can be more easily found by text queries. we achieve 82.72% accuracy in the tag prediction. through a simulation test of 5 queries, our system on average returns hundreds more results than the default dribbble search, leading to better relatedness, diversity and satisfaction. ui is crucial for the success of the software especially for mobile apps in the market. albeit a large number of ui designs online with human tags, many uis are still missing some closely related keywords for retrieval. to assist designers with better ui design retrieval, we adopt a deep learning method to automatically recommend additional tags that convey the semantics of the ui. based on the systematical analysis of the existing large-scale ui designs, our model can achieve the accuracy as 0.827 which significantly outperforms other baselines. the user study also demonstrates the usefulness of our model in ui retrieval. in the future, we are extending our research works into three different directions. on the one hand, we are diving into the model to improve the current accuracy performance. currently, we only evaluate our model on tags which have many related ui as the training data, and we will also customize our model for achieving good performance on tags with only small datasets. on the other hand, we are exploring the searching for dynamic animation ui designs. according to our observation, apart from the static ui design images, there are also some animation designs in gif format which show how users interact with the ui dynamically. we will leverage the video analysis method to analyze the human actions and design interactions within those gifs, so that designers can search the animation with textual queries. furthermore, to understand the usefulness of our technology in a real design context, we hope to cooperate with professional designers and design sharing sites by deploying our model. we will explore how designers actually make use of the retrieved uis, and collect valuable feedback to improve our technology and evaluation methods.",988
"Trans Time: Safety, Privacy, and Content Warnings on a Transgender-Specific Social Media Site",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415195,"trans people often use social media to connect with others, find and share resources, and post transition-related content. however, because most social media platforms are not built with trans people in mind and because online networks include people who may not accept one's trans identity, sharing trans content can be difficult. we studied trans time, a social media site developed particularly for trans people to document transition and build community. we interviewed early trans time users (n = 6) and conducted focus groups with potential users (n = 21) to understand how a trans-specific site uniquely supports its users. we found that trans time has the potential to be a safe space, encourages privacy, and effectively enables its users to selectively view content using content warnings. together, safety, privacy, and content warnings create an online space where trans people can simultaneously build community, find support, and express both the mundanity and excitement of trans life. yet in each of these areas, we also learned ways that the site can improve. we provide implications for how social media sites may better support trans users, as well as insular communities of people from other marginalized groups. we talked with current and potential users of trans time, a social media site created specifcally for trans and/or non-binary people to document their transitions and build community, to understand how social media sites can support trans people’s needs. while some aspects of the site are similar to social media sites built for the general population, trans time’s specifc community focus makes it unique in several ways. the insulated community, active moderation, and the values instilled in its guidelines and policies meant that participants considered the site a potentially safe space. additionally, the site’s privacy features enabled the audience segmentation necessary for people during and after gender transition. finally, we learned from participants how trans time’s content warnings can be designed with enough granularity to address the community’s needs. taken together, safety, privacy, and content warnings create a site that uniquely meets the needs of trans people, and enables them to fnd support, build community, and express both the exciting and mundane aspects of being trans. by examining trans time via kraut and resnick’s [53] design claims for online communities, we determined ways the site is similar to online communities more broadly (e.g., the need to uphold community norms and values and practice community boundary management), yet with important diferences (e.g., trans time’s focus on small size rather than rapid membership increase, and the importance of changeable rather than static user identities for trans users). our design recommendations, beyond providing guidance for trans time, detail ways other social media sites may be able to better support the marginalized individuals and communities who use their sites, and ways that sites can be designed to support specifc marginalized online communities.",989
Social App Accessibility for Deaf Signers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415196,"social media platforms support the sharing of written text, video, and audio. all of these formats may be inaccessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing (dhh), particularly those who primarily communicate via sign language, people who we call deaf signers. we study how deaf signers engage with social platforms, focusing on how they share content and the barriers they face. we employ a mixed-methods approach involving seven in-depth interviews and a survey of a larger population (n = 60). we find that deaf signers share the most in written english, despite their desire to share in sign language. we further identify key areas of difficulty in consuming content (e.g., lack of captions for spoken content in videos) and producing content (e.g., captioning signed videos, signing into a phone camera) on social media platforms. our results both provide novel insights into social media use by deaf signers and reinforce prior findings on dhh communication more generally, while revealing potential ways to make social media platforms more accessible to deaf signers. we investigated how social media platforms can better accommodate deaf signers by asking 67 individuals about how they share and the barriers they face on popular platforms. we provide depth to current literature on dhh social media use by focusing specifcally on deaf signers, their sharing behaviors on a variety of platforms, who they share with, and why they choose to share with the methods they do. while many deaf signers prefer to share in sign language, they resort to sharing in english on platforms due to barriers in sharing videos. we discuss in depth these novel barriers including difculty in creating captions, difculty flming sign, and language barriers. based on the insights found in this study, we present many feasible changes for platforms and areas for future research to better support deaf signers. we hope this work inspires similar in-depth explorations of the deaf community’s unique usage of various interfaces.",990
On the Desiderata for Online Altruism: Nudging for Equitable Donations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415197,"online donation platforms help equalize access to opportunity and funding in cases where inequalities exist. in the context of public school education in the united states, for instance, financial inequalities have been shown to be reflected in the educational system, since schools are primarily funded through local property taxes. in response, private charitable donation platforms such as donorschoose.org have emerged seeking to alleviate systemic inequalities. yet, the question remains of how effective these platforms are in redressing existing funding inequalities across school districts. our analysis of donation data from donorschoose shows that such platforms may in fact be ineffective in mitigating existing inequalities or may even exacerbate them. in this paper, we explore how online educational charities could direct more funding towards more impoverished schools without compromising their donors' freedom of choice with respect to donation targets. seeking to answer this question, we draw on the line of work on choice architectures in behavioral economics and pose a novel research question on the impact of interface design on equity in socio-technical systems. through controlled experiments, we demonstrate how simple interface design interventions - such as modifying default rankings or displaying additional information about schools - might lead to changes in donation distributions helping platforms direct more funding towards schools in need. going beyond online educational charities, we hope that our work will bring attention to the role of interface design nudges in the social requirements of online altruism.",991
Roles in the Discussion: An Analysis of Social Support in an Online Forum for People with Dementia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415198,"social computing provides a variety of challenges and opportunities for people who are experiencing cognitive decline. following a recent diagnosis of dementia, older adults sometimes engage in online communities designated for people with dementia. in this work, we analyzed all original posts from a seven-year period on a forum for persons with dementia to understand 1) who posts in this forum and 2) what kinds of social support posters seek to gain from this engagement. our analyses indicate that, in addition to people with dementia, a variety of dementia-related stakeholders create original posts in this forum. our results suggest that seeking and offering social support are key activities for all forum users, not just those with dementia for whom the forum was designated. given these findings, we offer design implications for online spaces for vulnerable communities, with a focus on design that allows for external stakeholder participation while still maintaining the privacy and safety of vulnerable members of the community. this paper describes the results of a research project in which we analyzed the roles of individuals posting on a forum for pwd. original posters inhabited a variety of roles, seeking and providing social support in this online community. the public—including family, friends, and caregivers—sought more support than they provided. this imbalance has the potential, particularly over time, to overload the pwd with explaining and comforting others about their disease. our findings also indicate that posters who were not able to be identified as pwd or ffc provided more support than they sought, indicating the potential benefits of including such people in a forum that was not created for them in the first place. based on these findings, we propose a model to streamline posts by people without dementia and create a safe space for those with dementia. although the forum studied in this work is designated for pwd, the public (i.e. family, caregivers, friends, and people with no relation to the disease) could all benefit from the conversation. in the future, researchers, designers, and developers alike must find ways to support all of these various stakeholders in participating without burdening the most vulnerable members of the community. the model we present here should be tested for pwd as well as other similar communities coping with long-term disability or illness. these platforms must then be tested for their appropriateness, utility, and level of respect they afford to both the vulnerable population themselves and their allies. a variety of additional supports, both in terms of human policy and intelligent systems, will likely be needed to bring such a model fully to fruition. however, parts of it can work with existing tools. future research should seek to develop these new tools as well as test this model with existing ones. finally, in this work, we identify a variety of challenges that could arise in moderation of spaces for pwd. this works serves as a base model to understanding how we can design online communities with focal points not just for pwd, but also other vulnerable communities. in our future work, we will seek to expand this model following additional analyses, such as of responses to original posters and in other communities, as well as through testing functional platforms.",992
Religion and Sustainability: Lessons of Sustainable Computing from Islamic Religious Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415199,"while persuasion has often been considered an important design tool for achieving sustainable behavior, a growing scholarship is criticizing it for its narrow focus on individuals and an overarching economic worldview. this criticism is often based on the limitations of economic-rationales that many persuasive design efforts hold and cannot fully capture the values of people who reside outside the modern scientific world - especially where values originate from and are shaped by religiosity and spirituality. we join this discourse and argue that such a narrow view of persuasion sidelines the theological roots. based on our six-month long ethnography with the islamic communities in a bangladeshi city, kushtia, we describe how 'motivation' and 'habit' are built there - two of the basic components of persuasion. drawing from a rich body of literature on the sociology of religions and theology, we highlight how islamic values are closely tied to the idea of persuasion and reflect a vision of sustainable living. we further discuss how such a deeper understanding of religious values can help design for sustainable living and broaden the scope of cscw literature in the various domains.",993
Sociocultural Dimensions of Tracking Health and Taking Care,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415200,"the field of personal health informatics has received increasing attention within the cscw and hci communities as health tracking becomes more affordable, accessible, and pervasive. chronic disease management, in particular, presents tremendous potential for intervention given patients' ability to now actively participate in their care through tracking. the focus on 'personal' in health informatics, however, obfuscates the role of other cultural and ecological factors that might shape health tracking behaviors, and important information from alternative sources could be ignored by virtue of being subjective, complex, or simply hard to collect. to dig deeper into these negative spaces that may go untracked, uncover potential sources of important health information, and more completely understand current tracking practices, we embarked on an interview study with patients with cardiac diseases in bangalore, india. in this paper, we present these patients' current health management approaches that are culturally situated, identifying both motivations and barriers to tracking, their attitudes towards online information, as well as cultural and ecological influences on their perceptions of cardiac care. we then discuss the interplay between our findings and current notions of, and approaches towards, patient empowerment and datafication of health. cscw literature is increasingly exploring the socioculturally situated nature of health tracking. we extend this work by highlighting the technological, personal, interpersonal, and ecological factors that influence health tracking. in this paper, we presented a qualitative inquiry with 18 patients with cardiac diseases and 8 doctors in bangalore, india to reveal how health tracking practices are informed by the individuals’ attitudes towards health information, the dynamics of patient-doctor interactions and sociocultural norms. we argue that our findings have implications on patient-centered care and patient empowerment, as well as devising data-driven insights for healthcare.",994
"Combating Misinformation in Bangladesh: Roles and Responsibilities as Perceived by Journalists, Fact-checkers, and Users",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415201,"there has been a growing interest within cscw community in understanding the characteristics of misinformation propagated through computational media, and the devising techniques to address the associated challenges. however, most work in this area has been concentrated on the cases in the western world leaving a major portion of this problem unaddressed that is situated in the global south. this paper aims to broaden the scope of this discourse by focusing on this problem in the context of bangladesh, a country in the global south. the spread of misinformation on facebook in bangladesh, a country with a population of over 163 million, has resulted in chaos, hate attacks, and killings. by interviewing journalists, fact-checkers, in addition to surveying the general public, we analyzed the current state of verifying misinformation in bangladesh. our findings show that most people in the 'news audience' want the news media to verify the authenticity of online information that they see online. however, the newspaper journalists say that fact-checking online information is not a part of their job, and it is also beyond their capacity given the amount of information being published online every day. we further find that the voluntary fact-checkers in bangladesh are not equipped with sufficient infrastructural support to fill in this gap. we show how our findings are connected to some of the core concerns of cscw community around social media, collaboration, infrastructural politics, and information inequality. from our analysis, we also suggest several pathways to increase the impact of fact-checking efforts through collaboration, technology design, and infrastructure development. in this study, we have examined how multiple entities - journalists, fact-checkers, and internet users - in bangladesh have experienced and confronted online misinformation with limited resource, freedom of press, and access to information. we have reported the communication gap between journalists and fact-checkers that resulted in a lack of defined responsibility of who should factcheck online misinformation. we also have identified several verification strategies of regular users. our findings provide several design and policy implications, and suggest the need for development of computational tools and increasing cooperative work to combat misinformation in the developing world.",995
Quantifying the Causal Effects of Conversational Tendencies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415202,"understanding what leads to effective conversations can aid the design of better computer-mediated communication platforms. in particular, prior observational work has sought to identify behaviors of individuals that correlate to their conversational efficiency. however, translating such correlations to causal interpretations is a necessary step in using them in a prescriptive fashion to guide better designs and policies. in this work, we formally describe the problem of drawing causal links between conversational behaviors and outcomes. we focus on the task of determining a particular type of policy for a text-based crisis counseling platform: how best to allocate counselors based on their behavioral tendencies exhibited in their past conversations. we apply arguments derived from causal inference to underline key challenges that arise in conversational settings where randomized trials are hard to implement. finally, we show how to circumvent these inference challenges in our particular domain, and illustrate the potential benefits of an allocation policy informed by the resulting prescriptive information. in this work, we considered the problem of translating observed relationships between conversational behaviors and outcomes into actionable insights. through examining a particular policy— allocating agents in conversational platforms—that such observational analyses could inform, we formally described the inference task and inherent challenges involved, translating causal inference arguments to the domain of conversations. in the context of crisis counseling, we demonstrated the importance of properly addressing these challenges, but also the potential benefits of policies that are informed by careful analyses of conversations. here, we describe how our particular work informs broader studies of computer-mediated settings where conversations play a central role. we also highlight some empirical and theoretical limitations that future work could take up. the bulk of our work examines one type of conversational setting—goal-oriented asymmetric conversation platforms—and one type of policy—allocating agents. this focus enables us to develop theoretical descriptions that clearly highlight key aspects of the inference task—the relationships between behavior, circumstance, and outcome; it is also grounded in a socially consequential realworld setting, crisis counseling. we note, however, that this inference task is relevant to a broader range of conversational settings: like team discussions or public forms, where conversational roles may be more fluid and extend beyond that of agent and client, while different participants may have different goals in the conversation. a platform could also pursue a range of other policies, such as training effective conversational behaviors or deterring detrimental ones via practices like moderation. these related settings and policies inherit the challenges we have described: the underlying problems of causally relating behaviors and outcomes, and of addressing the inference challenges from assignment and interaction, continue to be salient beyond our particular focus. we see our work as critically examining one important part of developing policies to improve conversational platforms: translating descriptive findings based on observational data into prescriptive information. designing and implementing these policies requires a wealth of additional research. for instance, other studies could examine more intricate conversational behaviors and tendencies, viewing the rich types of characteristics explored in many past descriptive studies through a causal lens. a more nuanced understanding of conversational outcomes is needed to gauge the effectiveness of any policy. for example, in this setting, a complementary line of work could develop more informative ways to elicit texter feedback, seeking to better understand and mitigate the presently low response rate; understanding longer-term impacts of a counseling conversation would also be valuable. numerous factors relating to the implementation of a policy would need to be accounted for as well; as noted earlier, the estimated benefits of allocating more conversations to counselors must be weighed against the potential for the additional workload to strain the counselors’ mental health and conversational effectiveness. addressing these aspects is beyond the scope of our work, and we look to other studies of computer-mediated communication platforms for promising approaches [30, 32]. however, we emphasize that the core problem of measuring the causal effects of a policy is salient regardless of the extent to which other components of the policy are well-developed—such that identifying these effects, while not sufficient, is necessary in informing these policies.",996
CrowdCO-OP: Sharing Risks and Rewards in Crowdsourcing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415203,"paid micro-task crowdsourcing has gained in popularity partly due to the increasing need for large-scale manually labelled datasets which are often used to train and evaluate artificial intelligence systems. modern paid crowdsourcing platforms use a piecework approach to rewards, meaning that workers are paid for each task they complete, given that their work quality is considered sufficient by the requester or the platform. such an approach creates risks for workers; their work may be rejected without being rewarded, and they may be working on poorly rewarded tasks, in light of the disproportionate time required to complete them. as a result, recent research has shown that crowd workers may tend to choose specific, simple, and familiar tasks and avoid new requesters to manage these risks. in this paper, we propose a novel crowdsourcing reward mechanism that allows workers to share these risks and achieve a standardized hourly wage equal for all participating workers. reward-focused workers can thereby take up challenging and complex hits without bearing the financial risk of not being rewarded for completed work. we experimentally compare different crowd reward schemes and observe their impact on worker performance and satisfaction. our results show that 1) workers clearly perceive the benefits of the proposed reward scheme, 2) work effectiveness and efficiency are not impacted as compared to those of the piecework scheme, and 3) the presence of slow workers is limited and does not disrupt the proposed cooperation-based approaches. in this paper, we have proposed and experimentally evaluated novel crowdsourcing risk and reward sharing schemes that enable crowd workers to move away from piecework payments and allow them to focus on performing crowd work with less stress and less time pressure. our method also encourages workers to try diverse tasks. even reward-motivated workers can take up challenging and complex hits without worrying about missing financial rewards. to this end, we built a new crowdsourcing platform, crowdco-op, by leveraging the api provided by mturk, that allows us to perform controlled experiments comparing different reward distribution mechanisms and task information. our findings show that co-op reward sharing creates a win-win situation for both workers and requesters: for workers, unrewarded activities are shared thus allowing for risk mitigation; for requesters, our alternative reward mechanisms lead to a more productive workforce and do not lead to lower quality data.",997
On the Misinformation Beat: Understanding the Work of Investigative Journalists Reporting on Problematic Information Online,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415204,"journalists are increasingly investigating and reporting on problematic online content such as misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories, leading to the creation of a new misinformation beat. the process of collecting, analyzing, and reporting on this kind of data is complex and nuanced. it is especially challenging as online actors attempt to undermine their work. through in-depth interviews with twelve journalists, we explore how they investigate and report on online misinformation and disinformation. our findings reveal some of the unique challenges of reporting on this beat, as well as the ways in which reporters overcome those challenges. we highlight and discuss how journalistic values could be better embedded into the design of tools to support their work, the power dynamics between social media companies and journalists, and the promise of collaborations as a way to support and educate journalists on this beat. this work provides contextual knowledge to researchers looking to better support investigative journalists - on the misinformation beat and beyond - as their work becomes more entangled in sociotechnical systems. online platforms have become increasingly salient in breaking news events, culture, and politics. consequently, journalists are looking to these spaces for stories and investigations. this research provides a window into the practices of journalists who are investigating their stories on and through social media. in particular, we focus on journalists working an emergent new beat of online misand disinformation. we find that journalists overcome the unique technical, methodological, ethical challenges of this work by embedding themselves in online communities, working with experts, and improving their own data skills. situating the findings within literature about changing journalism practices, computational tools designed to support modern journalists, and the complexities of online disinformation, we contribute insight into how to better support these kinds of journalists in the future. we suggest that designers of data tools for journalists pay special attention to the traditional values held by those in the journalism field. we discuss the power dynamics that exist between journalists and platforms, and we suggest that future work involves studying the informal collaborations between journalists and researchers that are already taking place. we foresee this ""beat"" will grow to include more journalists, including those looking specifically at online mis- and disinformation as well as adjacent topics such as bullying, harassment, and radicalization, and we see supporting these emerging experts as an opportunity for future cscw research.",998
Food Aid Technology: The Experience of a Syrian Refugee Community in Coping with Food Insecurity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415205,"over half of syrian refugee households in lebanon are food insecure with some reliant on an electronic voucher (e-voucher) system for food aid. the interplay between the digitisation of food aid, within the socio-technical context of refugees, and community collaborative practices is yet to be investigated. through design engagements and interviews with refugees and shop owners we explore the experiences of a syrian refugee community in lebanon using the e-voucher system. we provide insights into the socio-technical environment in which the e-voucher system is dispensing aid, the information and power asymmetries experienced, refugee collaborative coping practices and how they interplay with the e-voucher system. we highlight the need for: (1) expanding refugee digital capabilities to encompass understandings of aid technologies and identifying trusted intermediaries and (2) for technologies to support in upholding humanitarian principles and mitigating power and information asymmetries. lastly, we call for cscw researchers and humanitarian innovators to consider how humanitarian technologies can enable refugee collaborative practices and adopt everyday security as a lens for designing aid technologies. the paper contributes to cscw knowledge regarding the interplay between aid technologies and refugees? socio-technical contexts and practices that provides a basis for future technological designs for collaborative technologies for refugee food security. through investigating a refugee community’s experience of coping with food insecurity while engaging with a technological food aid system, we identified how the digitisation of aid shifted the responsibility of dispensing aid from ngo organisations to shop owners, in turn introducing issues of technological literacy; as well as power and information asymmetries. furthermore, we show how refugee participants have developed collaborative practices including collective purchasing. when further investigating the feasibility of collective purchasing, participants highlighted the added value further leveraging this collaborative practice has in coping with food insecurity. however, the current food aid technology does not lend itself to such forms of collaborative action. research within the field of food security has shown that unrestricted cash assistance is as effective as the e-voucher system in supporting refugees to cope with food insecurity [5]. however, while unrestricted cash has been shown to be as positive in terms of improving food security as e-vouchers, they do not match the significant impact that e-vouchers have on improving dietary diversity [5]. therefore, the wfp is currently trialing combination models where particularly vulnerable refugees receive e-vouchers and an unrestricted cash top-up [5]. it is within such models that we can start designing and piloting technologies for collective purchasing that may leverage the unrestricted cash available within refugee communities. however, given that the refugee community we worked with was mostly reliant on e-vouchers to purchase food we need to consider how the e-voucher system can be re-designed to account for power and information asymmetries as well as the collaborative values and practices within refugee communities.",999
Collecting the Public Perception of AI and Robot Rights,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415206,"whether to give rights to artificial intelligence (ai) and robots has been a sensitive topic since the european parliament proposed advanced robots could be granted ""electronic personalities."" numerous scholars who favor or disfavor its feasibility have participated in the debate. this paper presents an experiment (n=1270) that 1) collects online users' first impressions of 11 possible rights that could be granted to autonomous electronic agents of the future and 2) examines whether debunking common misconceptions on the proposal modifies one's stance toward the issue. the results indicate that even though online users mainly disfavor ai and robot rights, they are supportive of protecting electronic agents from cruelty (i.e., favor the right against cruel treatment). furthermore, people's perceptions became more positive when given information about rights-bearing non-human entities or myth-refuting statements. the style used to introduce ai and robot rights significantly affected how the participants perceived the proposal, similar to the way metaphors function in creating laws. for robustness, we repeated the experiment over a more representative sample of u.s. residents (n=164) and found that perceptions gathered from online users and those by the general population are similar. this study collected online users’ perception of 11 possible rights for highly advanced and autonomous ai and robots of the future. we tested flexibility in people’s responses by exposing them to four kinds of carefully designed interventions. our study shows that online users, at first, disfavor rights to electronic agents. those rights most relevant in the context of legal systems and life — i.e., the right to sue and be sued, the right to hold assets, the right to enter contracts, and the right to life — faced the highest rejection amongst all. the only exception was the right against cruel treatment and punishment. the experiment also showed whether and how online users’ perceptions can be modified. respondents took more positive views after being exposed to interventions that corrected misinformation on legal personhood. this change was statistically significant. listing examples of rights-bearing non-human entities (i.e., non-human design) and explicitly explaining that humanity is not a requirement to hold rights (i.e., descriptive design) were the two most effective. on the other hand, discussing the lack of agreement among scholars on the requirements for legal personhood (i.e., normative design) and listing examples of human entities who were socially neglected in the past (i.e., human design) did not, in many cases, result in a significant stance-change. phrasing style was an essential factor that affected how people responded to our survey. for most of the proposed rights, indirectly introducing the proposal elicited more support. we posit that an allusive discussion style may create a sense that, rather than a right is granted to an electronic entity, a new duty is created for existing legal persons. in some scenarios, however, explicit phrasing elicited more support. we hypothesize that the concept of “rights” depends on its context and how it is posed. this finding is in accord with the argument that the regulation of ai will depend on which metaphors are used during the process [43]. likewise, the metaphors on how the rights were phrased affected people’s judgment of ai and robot rights. explicitly reminding people that the target electronic agents are completely autonomous was also critical in bringing more support; the stance towards most rights became more positive under this writing style. finally, we discuss a possible subject-expectancy effect in the survey results, a form of bias that might arise due to the reactivity of research subjects in the experiment. since the participants were presented with similar survey questions before and after the intervention, they may have been motivated to change their responses regardless of the intervention message. however, we consider this bias would be minimal for two reasons. first, the intervention was not instantaneous and took on average 97.5 seconds (see appendix b). this indicates that participants spent enough time reading and digesting the content. second, the stance-change was not random but consistently positive after the intervention. had any subject-expectancy effect been in play, the stance-change direction would not be consistent across all rights. our research does not, by any means, propose ai and robots be treated as humans, or as other non-natural legal persons. electronic agents are a new type of entity that must be regulated from the start while taking past experiences with diverse bodies and technologies. our survey results resonate with the argument that regulations should not necessarily consider ai and robots as “humans,” but one must acknowledge that people might treat them as so [43]. granting legal personhood to electronic agents is a contested possibility, and our results indicate that people are somewhat flexible and supportive of specific rights for ai and robots. when considered along with the previous progression of rights for animals and corporations (i.e., nonhuman entities), our results suggest that social norms could take one day shift in favor of granting fully autonomous ai and robots some rights (at least one or several) discussed in this paper. furthermore, given the controversial aspect of the proposal and historical precedents (e.g., rights of women and slaves), which have shown that granting rights to previously neglected entities is a slow process, our finding supports the argument that public opinion might change in the future. considering that our intervention was simple, real-life exposures to various other interventions may lead to a more considerable stance change. in conclusion, debunking common misconceptions regarding rights and duties to non-natural entities have shown to be successful in modifying people’s stance towards the possibility of granting rights to ai and robots. our results also indicate that some rights to electronic agents might be supported by the general public soon such as, for instance, the right against cruelty and copyright. we hope this research promotes a more inclusive discussion of a prominent, yet controversial issue involving the rapid deployment of ai and robots in society. granting rights to non-humans (and even some groups of humans) has always faced prejudice and rejections at first thought, but doing so has become an essential social and political aspect of contemporary society [48].",1000
Effects of Shared Gaze on Audio- Versus Text-Based Remote Collaborations,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415207,"remote collaborations are becoming ubiquitous, but, despite their many advantages, face unique challenges compared to collocated collaborations. visualizing the collaborator's point of gaze on a shared screen has been explored as a promising way to alleviate some of these limitations by increasing shared awareness. however, prior studies on shared gaze have not considered the medium of communication and have only studied its effect on audio. this paper presents a study that compares the effects of shared gaze on collaboration performance during audio- and text-based communication. we find that for text, shared gaze improved task correctness and led collaborators to look at and talk more about shared content. similar trends are found for gaze-augmented voice communication, but contrary to the slower performance in text, it also saw improvements in completion time as well as in cognitive workload. our findings demonstrate the differences in how shared gaze impacts audio- versus text-based communication and highlight the need to further understand the nuances of the medium of communication when designing novel tools to support remote collaborators. in this paper, we studied the effect of shared gaze on remote collaborations in which text-based communication was examined for the first time. we conducted a within-subjects study with 24 pairs that collaborated over voice- and text-based media with and without the presence of a real-time shared gaze visualization. this work presents novel findings on the effect of gaze on text-based communication. adding the real-time visualization of the partner’s gaze to chat improved collaboration in terms of task correctness and led participants to talk about and look more often at shared content. in addition, collaborators reported higher levels of awareness of their partner’s activity, as well as increased perceived performance, joint attention, and smooth flow of communication. however, shared gaze negatively impacted the effort and mental demand required from participants, who overall preferred gaze-augmented voice-based communication. contrary to text-based communication, collaboration over audio additionally benefited from shared gaze through reductions in completion time and cognitive workload. the comparison of results between gaze-augmented voice and text demonstrate that in text-based collaboration processes, shared gaze led to qualitative changes, rather than simply facilitating it. our study highlights the differences in how shared gaze impacts audio- versus text-based communication. while the results for voice mostly agree with prior literature, our novel findings demonstrate the potential benefits of real-time shared gaze visualization to text-based collaborations. although chat as a baseline medium could be seen as inferior to voice due to its inherently lower transmission velocity, the notable improvements in several objective and subjective measures show that further research is warranted to better understand the nuances of shared gaze in the context of text-based communication. thus, we believe this work presents a first step towards adding shared gaze as a feature to novel settings. in addition to implications for accessibility and recreational settings, our findings on gaze-augmented text communication are relevant for larger teams. the lack of familiarity between participants, the type of the task, and the time pressure during the experiment could all be factors that made participants favor higher-synchronicity, voice-based media. this shows that user satisfaction needs to be further investigated to match the objective improvements brought by shared gaze to text-based communication. ultimately, developers of novel gaze-sharing tools and interaction techniques should take into account the capabilities of the communication medium to better support remote collaborators.",1001
Supporting Women in Online Dating with a Messaging Interface that Improves their Face-to-Face Meeting Decisions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415208,"this paper presents a study of a messaging interface prototype for online dating intended to improve women's face-to-face meeting decisions, and therefore the capacity to manage the gendered risks involved with such meetings. the interface prompts users with discussion topics that are potentially more valuable for user evaluation than the impression management-motivated topics often chosen by men. these topics come in the form of first-date scenarios that messaging partners either agree or disagree on. through a mixed-methods study utilizing speed dating events, daters used the interface to interact before meeting face-to-face. results indicate that women's face-to-face meeting decisions improve when the interface prompts them to discuss scenarios involving agreement of opinion. men's decisions are worsened by the same interface variant, potentially due to the displayed agreement being misinterpreted as a signal of compatibility. the study ultimately stresses that designs intended for women, and at-risk groups more broadly, must also be assessed with other user demographics-namely those that pose a risk-to identify unforeseen implications. in this paper we presented the prompted discussion interface; a messaging interface for online dating systems intended to help women inform their face-to-face meeting decisions and therefore better manage the gendered risks of meeting new dating partners. the interface prompts users to discuss their pre-selected opinions about a first-date conflict scenario (e.g., a woman realizes her date lied about his real height in his profile; should she stop dating him?). results from a mixed methods study indicate that the variant of the interface that prompts users to discuss an agreement of opinion did improve women’s face-to-face meeting decisions, yet men’s decisions were worsened by the same interface variant, potentially due to a misinterpretation of a visualized agreement as a signal of compatibility. so while risks to women in regards to poorly informed face-to-face meeting decisions seemed to be mitigated, the interface inadvertently introduced a new risk by way of potentially misleading men about attraction or compatibility due to their misunderstanding of interface content. the results ultimately stress the importance of including user demographics that pose risk into research and design of interfaces for risk mitigation in order to identify unanticipated implications.",1002
"""Am I doing this all wrong?"": Challenges and Opportunities in Family Information Management",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415209,"running a household requires a large amount of labor, from ensuring multiple bills are paid to organizing important documents. failure to manage such information can have critical consequences for the financial and psychological well-being of the family; however, little is known about how families manage the full scale of information encountered in the home. in this paper, we introduce family information management (fim) as a set of overarching practices involved in managing and coordinating household-related information. to understand how families engage in fim, we conducted in-depth interviews with members of ten families, which included guided tours of their information archives. we found that families struggle to organize, store, retrieve, and share information, and that there are significant socioemotional costs to this work. we propose opportunities for designing technologies to support fim and argue that, given the numerous challenges and unmet needs, the understudied area of fim deserves further investment of research and design efforts. in this study, we introduced the term family information management (fim) to characterize a set of practices involved in managing the information needs in households, which we see as distinct from pim and gim. we identifed how families triage, store, retrieve, and share household-related information, the challenges they face in doing so, and the socioemotional factors associated with such information management. based on our fndings, we put forth guidance for technologies targeted at the fim space. our study shows that fim is a challenging but necessary part of everyday life, underserved by current technologies, and understudied in the hci literature. research in this area can make meaningful improvements to the well-being of individuals and families, and we are hopeful that this work will fuel further interest and research into fim.",1003
Implicit Diversity in Image Summarization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415210,"studies have shown that the people depicted in image search results tend to be of majority groups with respect to socially salient attributes such as gender or race. this skew goes beyond that which already exists in the world - i.e., the search results for images of people are more imbalanced than the ground truth would suggest. for example, kay et al. showed that although 28% of ceos in the u.s. are women, only 10% of the top 100 results for ""ceo"" in google image search are women. similar observations abound across search terms and across socially salient attributes. most existing approaches to correct for this kind of bias assume that the images of people include labels denoting the relevant socially salient attributes. these labels are explicitly used to either change the dataset, adjust the training of the algorithm, and/or in the execution of the method. however, such labels are often unknown. further, using machine learning techniques to infer these labels may often not be possible within acceptable accuracy ranges and may not be desirable due to the additional biases this process could incur. as observed in prior work, alternate approaches consider the diversity of image features, which often do not translate to images of visibly diverse people. we develop a novel approach that takes as input a visibly diverse control set of images of people and uses this set as part of a procedure to select a set of images of people in response to a query. the goal is to have a resulting set that is more visibly diverse in a manner that emulates the diversity depicted in the control set. it accomplishes this by evaluating the similarity of the images selected by a black-box algorithm with the images in the diversity control set, and incorporating this ""diversity score"" into the final selection process. importantly, this approach does not require images to be labelled at any point; effectively, it gives a way to implicitly diversify the set of images selected. we provide two variants of our approach: the first is a modification of the well known mmr algorithm to incorporate the diversity scores, and the second is a more efficient variant that does not consider within-list redundancy. we evaluate these approaches empirically on two image datasets: 1) a new dataset we collect which contains the top 100 google image results for 96 occupations, for which we evaluate gender and skin-tone diversity with respect to occupations and 2) the well-known celeba dataset containing images of celebrities for which we can evaluate gender diversity with respect to facial features such as ""smiling"" or ""glasses"". both of our approaches produce image sets that significantly improve the visible diversity of the results (i.e., include a larger fraction of anti-stereotypical images) with respect to current google image search results and other state-of-the-art algorithms for diverse image summarization. further, they seem to come at a minimal cost to accuracy. these empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of simple label-independent interventions to diversify image search. the approaches presented in this paper (qs-balanced and mmr-balanced) aim to ensure fairness in summarization algorithms in the absence of (explicitly or inferred) labelled data in either training or deployment in order to decrease bias. as a post-processing approach, it is also flexible in that it can be applied post-hoc to an existing system where the only additional input necessary is a small set of “diverse” images. we show its efficacy on two datasets: an image dataset of occupations where it can significantly improve the diversity of the images selected with little cost to accuracy as compared to images selected by google and an image dataset of celebrities where it can selects significantly more diverse images for gender-neutral facial attributes. due to the generality and simplicity of the approach, we expect our algorithm to perform well for a variety of domains, and it would be interesting to see to what extent it can be applied in areas beyond image summarization.",1004
Countering Fake News: A Comparison of Possible Solutions Regarding User Acceptance and Effectiveness,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415211,"since the emergence of so-called fake news on the internet and in social media, platforms such as facebook have started to take countermeasures, and researchers have begun looking into this phenomenon from a variety of perspectives. a large number of scientific work has investigated ways to detect fake news automatically. less attention has been paid to the subsequent step, i.e., what to do when you are aware of the inaccuracy of claims in social media. this work takes a user-centered approach on means to counter identified mis- and disinformation in social media. we conduct a three-step study design on how approaches in social media should be presented to respect the users' needs and experiences and how effective they are. as our first step, in an online survey representative for some factors to the german adult population, we enquire regarding their strategies on handling information in social media, and their opinion regarding possible solutions --- focusing on the approach of displaying a warning on inaccurate posts. in a second step, we present five potential approaches for countermeasures identified in related work to interviewees for qualitative input. we discuss (1) warning, (2) related articles, (3) reducing the size, (4) covering, and (5) requiring confirmation. based on the interview feedback, as the third step of this study, we select, improve, and examine four promising approaches on how to counter misinformation. we conduct an online experiment to test their effectiveness on the perceived accuracy of false headlines and also ask for the users' preferences. in this study, we find that users welcome warning-based approaches to counter fake news and are somewhat critical with less transparent methods. moreover, users want social media platforms to explain why a post was marked as disputed. the results regarding effectiveness are similar: warning-based approaches are shown to be effective in reducing the perceived accuracy of false headlines. moreover, adding an explanation to the warning leads to the most significant results. in contrast, we could not find a significant effect on one of facebook's current approaches (reduced post size and fact-checks in related articles). in this work, we examined and compared measures to counter fake news in social media. using a three-step study design, we took a closer look at their effectiveness and the user perspective. in summary, we found high acceptance of a warning approach, especially when combined with an explanation. warning-based approaches were also effective in reducing the estimated accuracy of false news headlines. our work provides relevant insights into the field of cscw and social computing and in particular to the question of a collaborative character of fake news. it is one thing to detect fake news content quickly and reliably, but the question remains what to do with such posts. social media platforms like facebook have started to develop and deploy strategies for that. with this work, we contribute to a better understanding of those approaches that can help to improve existing efforts.",1005
"'Yes, I comply!': Motivations and Practices around Research Data Management and Reuse across Scientific Fields",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415212,"as science becomes increasingly data-intensive, the requirements for comprehensive research data management (rdm) grow. this often overwhelms scientists, requiring more workload and training. the failure to conduct effective rdm leads to producing research artefacts that cannot be reproduced or reused. past research placed high value on supporting data science workers, but focused mainly on data production, collection, processing, and sensemaking. in order to understand practices and needs of data science workers in relation to documentation, preservation, sharing, and reuse, we conducted a cross-domain study with 15 scientists and data managers from diverse scientific domains. we identified five core concepts which describe requirements, drivers, and boundaries in the development of commitment for rdm, essential for generating reproducible research artefacts: practice, adoption, barriers, education, and impact. based on those concepts, we introduce a stage-based model of personal rdm commitment evolution. the model can be used to drive the design of future systems that support a transition to open science. we discuss infrastructure, policies, and motivations involved at the stages and transitions in the model. our work supports designers in understanding the constraints and challenges involved in designing for reproducibility in an age of data-driven science. this paper presented a systematic study of motivations and practices around research data management (rdm) and reuse across a wide variety of scientific domains. we extended work on barriers involved in rdm and collaboration in science to systematically map factors that contribute to motivation and impact researchers’ commitment towards rdm. we investigated how the design of emerging infrastructure shapes motivation and commitment towards rdm. the findings from our interview study with 15 researchers and research data managers highlighted the delicate balance between researchers’ frustration about bad data practices, lack of knowledge and ambiguity in rdm practices, and hesitation to commit to comprehensive rdm. based on our data analysis, we mapped practices around rdm and reuse across multiple scientific domains and described five core concepts: practice, education, adoption, barriers, and impact. based on those, we presented the stage-based model of personal rdm commitment evolution. we discussed drivers and inhibitors in the transition between the four stages of the model (non-reproducible practices, overcoming barriers, sustained commitment, and reward) and identified infrastructure and design components that provide accessible starting points for scholars and practitioners who want to contribute to better rdm systems. in particular, our work shows that a mix of different types of motivation and regulatory styles play a role at various stages in the rdm life cycle. we advocate for future field-specific investigations and the development of standardized instruments to map differences and commonalities of commitment drivers in the transition between the four stages. we hope that our research will stimulate further development of tools and systems that support the transition to open science.",1006
Mobile Collocated Gaming: Collaborative Play and Meaning-Making on a University Campus,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415213,"many mobile games are designed to be placeless, so that mobile device owners could play anytime, anywhere. but does such design erase the sense of place in mobile gaming? to investigate the spatiality of mobile gaming, we conducted an ethnographic study of mobile gaming in a chinese university. we found mobile gaming as a form of collocated interaction, where participants collectively created meanings around distinctive places on the campus including dormitory, classroom, and laboratory, and engaged in collaborative play. their mobile collocated gaming was shaped by the social, organizational, and cultural contexts of places. the spatiality of mobile collocated gaming entails both appropriation of the norms and expectations of places and creation of new meanings to negotiate tensions between mobile gaming and places. we further discuss the spatiality of mobile collocated gaming and broader social and cultural conditions. in this paper, we discussed the spatiality of mobile gaming in china, reporting on the distinctive characteristics of mobile gaming on a university campus. even for placeless-by-design mobile technologies, place is still meaningful for scrutinizing the intersection between play and infrastructure, clashes of individual and institutional values, and sites of negotiation, interpretation, and appropriation. much more future work could be done in this area, focusing on the enactment, transformation, and maintenance of places, and particularly their complex interactions with mobile technologies.",1007
Are You One of Us?: Current Hiring Practices Suggest the Potential for Class Biases in Large Tech Companies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415214,"to better understand how we can broaden participation in computing, this exploratory study examines the interview process for elite internships at established technology companies. through conducting 36 interviews with evaluators at technology companies, we find that in addition to technical competence, evaluators often assess internship applicants based on explicit and implicit signals of industrial fit, organizational fit, and individual fit. these evaluative criteria are reminiscent of prior literature linking biases in hiring to social class background. by reflecting on how our findings relate to previous studies, we suggest that evaluators? assessments of fit are potentially linked to social class background, and this might be an invisible factor contributing to hiring biases at technology companies. given that hiring only culturally similar employees can have negative individual, organizational, and societal consequences, we propose strategies for evaluators to broaden their evaluation perspectives and to enact inclusive interviewing practices. we conclude with a call for further research on the role of social class background in the hiring process. by studying how evaluators at technology companies assess applicants, this exploratory study investigates the hidden factors that shape evaluators’ assessments of interviewee applicants for elite internships. findings suggest that evaluators select candidates who signal three kinds of “fit” with the organization: applicants who display industrial fit by communicating and producing written materials in ways that align with the goals and values of the technology industry; applicants with internal referrals or social connections who will vouch for their organizational fit; and applicants who demonstrate individual fit with specific evaluators through an alignment of appearance, tastes, and reported leisure pursuits. drawing on literature on hiring and social class background, our research suggests the potentially critical role that social class background can play in the interview process of technology companies. as such, we call for hci and cscw communities to directly examine the relationships between social class background and hiring and to find ways to minimize the potential for systemic bias in hiring.",1008
A Framework for Understanding the Relationship between Social Media Discourse and Mental Health,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415215,"over 35% of the world's population uses social media. platforms like facebook, twitter, and instagram have radically influenced the way individuals interact and communicate. these platforms facilitate both public and private communication with strangers and friends alike, providing rich insight into an individual's personality, health, and wellbeing. to date, many researchers have employed a variety of methods for extracting mental health-centric features from digital text communication (dtc) data, including natural language processing, social network analysis, and extraction of temporal discourse patterns. however, none have explored a hierarchical framework for extracting features from private messages with the goal of unifying approaches across methodological domains. furthermore, while analyses of large, public corpora abound in existing literature, limited work has been done to explore the relationship between of private textual communications, personality traits, and symptoms of mental illness. we present a framework for constructing rich feature spaces from digital text communications. we then demonstrate the efficacy of our framework by applying it to a dataset of private facebook messages in a college student population (n=103). our results reveal key individual differences in temporal and relational behaviors, as well as language usage in relation to validated measures of trait-level anxiety, loneliness, and personality. this work represents a critical step forward in linking features of private social media messages to validated measures of mental health, wellbeing, and personality. analysis of digital text communications (dtcs) remains an open research area at the intersection of mental health and computing. dtcs are feature-rich characterizations of social context, yet remain largely underexplored in existing mobile sensing frameworks. in this paper, we have proposed the socialtext framework, which defines a hierarchical structure for holistically extracting features from dtc datasets. features pertaining to the semantics and lexicon of message content can characterize conversational context, while temporal and topological features can reveal social network ties and temporal messaging patterns. considering all message features in combination provides a comprehensive characterization of the effect of social dynamics of dtcs on participants’ mental states and allows researchers to leverage dtc feature extraction methodologies across academic disciplines. our results corroborate previously established results and reveal novel individual differences in temporal and relational behaviors, as well as in vocabulary usage and topics of discussion, on facebook messenger. this work provides a novel path forward for future analysis and discussion of the role of dtcs in personality, mental health, and wellbeing online.",1009
What Happens to All These Hackathon Projects?: Identifying Factors to Promote Hackathon Project Continuation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415216,"time-based events, such as hackathons and codefests, have become a global phenomenon attracting thousands of participants to hundreds of events every year. while research on hackathons has grown considerably, there is still limited insight into what happens to hackathon projects after the event itself has ended. while case studies have provided rich descriptions of hackathons and their aftermath, we add to this literature a large-scale quantitative study of continuation across hackathons in a variety of domains. our findings indicate that a considerable number of projects get continued after a hackathon has ended. our results also suggest that short- and long-term continuation are different phenomena. while short-term continuation is associated with technical preparation, number of technologies used in a project and winning a hackathon, long-term continuation is predicated on skill diversity among team members, their technical capabilities in relationship to the technologies and their intention to expand the reach of a project. moreover, we found intensive short-term activity to be associated with a lower likelihood of long-term project continuation. this paper contributes to our understanding of short- and long-term technical continuation behavior after a time-based social computing event by reporting on findings from a large-scale study of the hackathon database devpost. studying project continuation related to a theoretically founded selection of potential antecedents of continuation behavior we established that short- and longterm project continuation behavior are different phenomena. we found short-term continuation behavior to be associated with technical preparation activities prior to a hackathon, the number of technologies a team uses to create a project and winning one of the few prizes at a large event, while long-term continuation was conversely related to skill diversity and skill matching among team members and their intention to expand their project’s reach. moreover, we also found that intensive short-term activity can be detrimental to long-term continuation. these insights provide hints for organizers and participants of time-based social computing events on how to prepare, conduct and follow up on an event to be positively associated with project continuation after it has ended. in the future we are planning to conduct additional qualitative studies to assess the potential impact of participant and organizers motivations and expectations on continuation behavior and to explore continuation activities beyond technical contributions to the same repository that teams used during an event.",1010

Intersectional AI: A Study of How Information Science Students Think about Ethics and Their Impact,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415218,"recent literature has demonstrated the limited and, in some instances, waning role of ethical training in computing classes in the us. the capacity for artificial intelligence (ai) to be inequitable or harmful is well documented, yet it's an issue that continues to lack apparent urgency or effective mitigation. the question we raise in this paper is how to prepare future generations to recognize and grapple with the ethical concerns of a range of issues plaguing ai, particularly when they are combined with surveillance technologies in ways that have grave implications for social participation and restriction?from risk assessment and bail assignment in criminal justice, to public benefits distribution and access to housing and other critical resources that enable security and success within society. the us is a mecca of information and computer science (is and cs) learning for asian students whose experiences as minorities renders them familiar with, and vulnerable to, the societal bias that feeds ai bias. our goal was to better understand how students who are being educated to design ai systems think about these issues, and in particular, their sensitivity to intersectional considerations that heighten risk for vulnerable groups. in this paper we report on findings from qualitative interviews with 20 graduate students, 11 from an ai class and 9 from a data mining class. we find that students are not predisposed to think deeply about the implications of ai design for the privacy and well-being of others unless explicitly encouraged to do so. when they do, their thinking is focused through the lens of personal identity and experience, but their reflections tend to center on bias, an intrinsic feature of design, rather than on fairness, an outcome that requires them to imagine the consequences of ai. while they are, in fact, equipped to think about fairness when prompted by discussion and by design exercises that explicitly invite consideration of intersectionality and structural inequalities, many need help to do this empathy 'work.' notably, the students who more frequently reflect on intersectional problems related to bias and fairness are also more likely to consider the connection between model attributes and bias, and the interaction with context. our findings suggest that experience with identity-based vulnerability promotes more analytically complex thinking about ai, lending further support to the argument that identity-related ethics should be integrated into is and cs curriculums, rather than positioned as a stand-alone course. information science graduate student display varying degrees of sensitivity to the way in which their identities interact with power structures to limit their opportunities. the more readily students make these connections, the more they worry about ai fairness, which in turn, makes them more interested in hearing from the people at risk than expert observers or intermediaries. this empathy “work” does not come easily. students are willing to take on responsibility for the thought process around fairness, but they find it difficult to do and sometimes they need help. we have provided justification and also guidance for a pedagogical approach to empathetic and responsible ai learning. this includes recommendations to prompt imaginative discussions, using an intersectional lens as well as suggested methods for extrapolation through engagement. our study is inspired by a sense of urgency about the way that ai are being used to shape every aspect of our lives with little consideration for the impacts to society. we are concerned about the hazards of an environment that apologizes later, and how those norms impact ai design. we will use our findings to share future research about how best to prepare students to enter ai with a sense of empathy and concern for the most vulnerable, intersectional identities among us. future research might study the impact of “live” case studies in the classroom with vulnerable individuals and its impact on the way that students design. we will be looking for ways to integrate intersectional thinking about ai into the curriculum and to study its impact on ethics throughout of students ai training. our work contributes novel insights about intersectional thinking in the context of ai bias and fairness. it provides guidance to scholars about how to build on these findings for pedagogy with integrative learning approaches. however, our study is limited by a small sample size of students who do not represent the full range of developers. additionally, we encountered language constraints that may have limited the full articulation of their point of view and which also made it difficult for us to share our findings.",1012
ORES: Lowering Barriers with Participatory Machine Learning in Wikipedia,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3415219,"algorithmic systems---from rule-based bots to machine learning classifiers---have a long history of supporting the essential work of content moderation and other curation work in peer production projects. from counter-vandalism to task routing, basic machine prediction has allowed open knowledge projects like wikipedia to scale to the largest encyclopedia in the world, while maintaining quality and consistency. however, conversations about how quality control should work and what role algorithms should play have generally been led by the expert engineers who have the skills and resources to develop and modify these complex algorithmic systems. in this paper, we describe ores: an algorithmic scoring service that supports real-time scoring of wiki edits using multiple independent classifiers trained on different datasets. ores decouples several activities that have typically all been performed by engineers: choosing or curating training data, building models to serve predictions, auditing predictions, and developing interfaces or automated agents that act on those predictions. this meta-algorithmic system was designed to open up socio-technical conversations about algorithms in wikipedia to a broader set of participants. in this paper, we discuss the theoretical mechanisms of social change ores enables and detail case studies in participatory machine learning around ores from the 5 years since its deployment. in this ‘socio-technical systems paper,’ we first discussed ores as a technical system: an open api for providing access to machine learning models for wikipedians. we then discussed the socio-technical system we have developed around ores that allows us to encode communities emic concepts in their models, collaboratively and iteratively audit their performance, and support broad appropriation of the models both within wikipedia’s editing community and in the broader research community. we have also shown a series of demonstrative cases how these concepts are negotiated, audits are performed, and appropriation has taken place. this system, the observations, and the cases show a deep view of a technical system and the social structures around it. in particular, we analyze this arrangement as a more decoupled approach to machine learning in organizations, which we see as a more cscw-inspired approach to many issues being raised around the fairness, accountability, and transparency of machine learning.",1013

Urban Accessibility as a Socio-Political Problem: A Multi-Stakeholder Analysis,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432908,"traditionally, urban accessibility is defined as the ease of reaching destinations. studies on urban accessibility for pedestrians with mobility disabilities (e.g., wheelchair users) have primarily focused on understanding the challenges that the built environment imposes and how they overcome them. in this paper, we move beyond physical barriers and focus on socio-political challenges in the civic ecosystem that impedes accessible infrastructure development. using a multi-stakeholder approach, we interviewed five primary stakeholder groups (n=25): (1) people with mobility disabilities, (2) caregivers, (3) accessibility advocates, (4) department officials, and (5) policymakers. we discussed their current accessibility assessment and decision-making practices. we identified the key needs and desires of each group, how they differed, and how they interacted with each other in the civic ecosystem to bring about change. we found that people, politics, and money were intrinsically tied to underfunded accessibility improvement projects ""without continued support from the public and the political leadership, existing funding may also disappear. using the insights from these interviews, we explore how may technology enhance our stakeholders"" decision-making processes and facilitate accessible infrastructure development. in this work, we investigated urban accessibility as a socio-political problem by studying the various assessment, decision-making, and citizen engagement practices. using multistakeholder analysis, this work presents an expansive view of methods and challenges in making accessibility improvements. we tease apart each stakeholder’s roles and interactions within the urban decision-making structure for accessible infrastructure development. our study found several socio-political tensions impeding infrastructure development, including conflicting interests, unclear burden of responsibility, public disinterest, and limited funding. to facilitate accessibility efforts in this socio-political context, we identified six points of civic interactions and proposed directions for future technologies to utilize complementary data- and citizen-driven approaches, while acknowledging that technology is a facilitator rather a solution to socio-political problems.",1016
"""So-called privacy breeds evil"": Narrative Justifications for Intimate Partner Surveillance in Online Forums",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432909,"a growing body of research suggests that intimate partner abusers use digital technologies to surveil their partners, including by installing spyware apps, compromising devices and online accounts, and employing social engineering tactics. however, to date, this form of privacy violation, called intimate partner surveillance (ips), has primarily been studied from the perspective of victim-survivors. we present a qualitative study of how potential perpetrators of ips harness the emotive power of sharing personal narratives to validate and legitimise their abusive behaviours. we analysed 556 stories of ips posted on publicly accessible online forums dedicated to the discussion of sexual infidelity. we found that many users share narrative posts describing ips as they boast about their actions, advise others on how to perform ips without detection, and seek suggestions for next steps to take. we identify a set of common thematic story structures, justifications for abuse, and outcomes within the stories that provide a window into how these individuals believe their behaviour to be justified. using these stories, we develop a four-stage framework that captures the change in a potential perpetrator's approach to ips. we use our findings and framework to guide a discussion of efforts to combat abuse, including how we can identify crucial moments where interventions might be safely applied to prevent or deescalate ips. this paper presents qualitative analyses of 556 posts from three publicly-accessible infidelity support forums in which users reported narrative accounts of using ips against their targets. we found that sexual infidelity within an intimate relationship was used as a means of excusing abusive behaviours. we identified that posters’ stories followed common narrative pathways and used a set of common actions, events, and themes that we list in this work. within these accounts, we identified a list of 21 justifications that posters used to legitimise their control and harm of others. we supplement these findings with a conceptual framework of how posters make sense of their use of ips over time in reporting to this community. our findings raise interesting questions as to how this data-set could be used to inform professional approaches to perpetrators online, how we could validate our conceptual model outside of online spaces and ideas for intervening safely.",1017
Saudi Arabian Parents' Perception of Online Marital Matchmaking Technologies,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432910,"finding a date or a spouse online is usually considered an individualistic endeavor in western cultures. this presents a challenge for collectivist non-western cultures such as saudi arabia where choosing a spouse is viewed as a union of two families with parents of both spouses being heavily involved. our work aims to investigate how saudi arabian parents view the utilization of technology by their young adults to seek potential spouses online. we report our findings of interviews conducted with 16 saudi arabian parents (8 fathers, 6 mothers and 1 couple). we generate qualitative themes that provide insights about how parents wanted to preserve their values, integrate technology into the traditional process and protect their young adults from potential harms. these themes lead to implications for designing suitable marital matchmaking technologies in saudi arabia and opportunities for future work. our study has explored how saudi arabian parents perceive marital matchmaking technologies and what role they want play in them. our interviews with 16 saudi arabian parents revealed that it is important to preserve saudi arabian values within marital matchmaking technologies, find ways for technology to coexist with the traditional marriage process and minimize potential harms through regulation. our findings provide insights to guide the hci community to be more culturally sensitive and inclusive, which aims to understand and account for human values in the design process. we also provide implications on how to design matchmaking technologies in this context based on preserving values, involving parents and ensuring young adults' safety. we outlined different avenues for future investigations in this context and provide our solutions. with this work, we provide a contextually grounded research study to benefit the future work of value-sensitive design in the cscw community.",1018
Birds of a Caste - How Caste Hierarchies Manifest in Retweet Behavior of Indian Politicians,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432911,"the hindu caste system plays an important role in the socio-political landscape of india. in recent years, indian politicians have moved a lot of direct communication online. social media is now an important space for the articulation and performance of their political positions. in this paper, we study ways in which the political performance of caste relations can be captured from the online connections and messaging of parliamentarians in india. we run tests of odds ratios among the members of loksabha (lower house) of india to find the extent to which their engagement is insular to their own caste group versus other groups. we observe that in the loksabha network, members of parliament (mps) have higher odds of getting retweeted by others whose caste is the same or closer to their own in the caste hierarchy. the findings of this research shed light on an understudied, yet critical, social relation of caste in the study of political behavior on social media. our goal in this paper was to introduce the study of an important sociological phenomenon, caste, in the research of political behavior on indian twitter. we introduce the historical and modern forms of manifestation of the caste system in india, particularly in the majority hindu community, and discuss its centrality in the political landscape of india. we highlight the lack of discussion of the ‘general category’ in studies of caste and politics in india that renders upper caste communities casteless and makes the hierarchical and interactive nature of caste relations within them invisible. by presenting a study of caste and online behavior in the mps that focuses on characterizing brahmins, upper caste-non-brahmins and intermediary castes (forward castes,) without simply focusing on other backward castes, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes (backward castes), we change the conversation of caste from only being about deprivation and discrimination to that of caste privilege. we observe that caste as well as party have a significant effect, in some cases, in the likelihood of getting retweeted in the mps network. we also observe trends of homophily at the group-level (for each caste category) where the likelihood of an mp getting retweeted by upper-caste mps is higher for upper-caste themselves. this is especially true for those similar or closer to their own caste in the hierarchy. additionally, we observe party-level and caste-level trends of cohesion or support within castes who are fighting for recognition of rights or engaging with particular issues of concern for their caste at the local and national level. these trends imply the need for a study of caste along with other variables that are central to online political behavior like party, language, gender, etc. it shows that there is indeed a different “in-group” and “out-group” politics at play beyond that of ideological and party differences. the significance of the question we ask when compared to the united states elections would be similar to examining the social media cohesiveness and pecking order of ethnicities in the highest legislative body of the country. while it is hard so say how well these findings translate to a different setting, india is the largest democracy in the world where caste and religion remain arguably the most important issues in the electoral system. we also describe a detailed methodological approach of tackling the messiy of the nature of caste and the challenges it poses for researchers who wish to do studies of caste and social media. we highlight the challenges in collating caste information of indian mps in spite of the significant role caste plays in indian politics. we urge other researchers of social computing and cscw community who are interested in thinking about structural inequality in south asia to work on collecting more detailed and accurate information on caste, in addition to outlining different ways of studying caste and caste dynamics online.",1019
CommunityClick: Capturing and Reporting Community Feedback from Town Halls to Improve Inclusivity,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432912,"local governments still depend on traditional town halls for community consultation, despite problems such as a lack of inclusive participation for attendees and difficulty for civic organizers to capture attendees' feedback in reports. building on a formative study with 66 town hall attendees and 20 organizers, we designed and developed communityclick, a communitysourcing system that captures attendees' feedback in an inclusive manner and enables organizers to author more comprehensive reports. during the meeting, in addition to recording meeting audio to capture vocal attendees' feedback, we modify iclickers to give voice to reticent attendees by allowing them to provide real-time feedback beyond a binary signal. this information then automatically feeds into a meeting transcript augmented with attendees' feedback and organizers' tags. the augmented transcript along with a feedback-weighted summary of the transcript generated from text analysis methods is incorporated into an interactive authoring tool for organizers to write reports. from a field experiment at a town hall meeting, we demonstrate how communityclick can improve inclusivity by providing multiple avenues for attendees to share opinions. additionally, interviews with eight expert organizers demonstrate communityclick's utility in creating more comprehensive and accurate reports to inform critical civic decision-making. we discuss the possibility of integrating communityclick with town hall meetings in the future as well as expanding to other domains. in this study, we investigated the practices and issues around the inequality of opportunity in providing feedback in town halls, especially for reticent participants. to inform our work, we attended several town halls and surveyed 66 attendees and 20 organizers. based on our findings, we designed and developed communityclick, where we modified iclickers as a real-time response mechanism to give voice to silent meeting attendees and reflect on their feedback by augmenting automatically generated meeting transcripts with organizers’ tags and attendees’ feedback. we proposed a novel feedback-weighted text summarization method along with extracting the most relevant discussion topics to better capture community’s perspectives. we also designed an interactive interface to enable multi-faceted exploration of the summary, main discussion topics, and augmented meeting-generated data to enable organizers to author more inclusive reports. we deployed communityclick in-the-wild to conduct a field experiment and interviewed 8 expert organizers to evaluate our system. our evaluation demonstrated communityclick’s efficacy in creating a more inclusive communication channel to capture attendees’ opinions from town halls and provide evidence of attendees’ feedback that could help organizers to author more comprehensive and accurate reports to inform critical civic decision-making. we discussed how communityclick could be integrated into the current town hall ecosystem and possibly expanded to other domains.",1020
Seeing in Context: Traditional Visual Communication Practices in Rural Bangladesh,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432913,"there is a risk that modern practices of information communication and visualization in human-computer interaction can sideline communities due to their prioritization of scientific rationality. such ideological hegemony can complicate interactions with data and computers, especially for low-literate communities in the global south. through a six-month long ethnographic study with nakshi-katha makers, hindu idol makers, and witchcraft practitioners, we investigated how rural practitioners use their own forms of representation and narrative in record keeping, social and religious storytelling, and information mediated decision making. we find that traditionally developed approaches towards presenting and communicating information often make use of concrete units to represent entities and connect to designers' cultural practices and the physical location. further, we identify how medium has significant influence in meaning-making. often these strategies and conventions are passed down through generations within the community. in this paper, we discuss how this rural tradition differs from the modern information communication practices, discussing how an understanding of traditional practices for representing information can be useful in developing more accessible, and culturally appropriate modern tools and technologies for the people of rural bangladesh and similar communities. in this paper we explored how modern practices of information visualization in human-computer interaction risk sidelining marginalized communities due to prioritization of scientific rationality and modernity. through a six-month long ethnographic study with nakshi-katha makers, hindu idol makers, and witchcraft practitioners, we investigated how rural practitioners use their own forms of representation and narrative in record keeping, social and religious storytelling, and information-mediated decision-making. we found that traditionally developed approaches towards presenting information often made use of concrete units to represent entities and connect to designers’ cultural practices and the physical location. further, we identified how medium had a significant influence in individuals’ meaning-making and how strategies and conventions are passed down through generations within the community. we discussed how the rural traditions we observed differ from the modern information visualization practices, exploring how an understanding of traditional practices for representing information might be useful in developing more accessible, and culturally appropriate modern tools and technologies for the people of rural bangladesh and similar communities. we hope that our findings might offer additional insight for researchers and practitioners investigating ways to broaden the impact of information and collaborative technologies.",1021
Tensions between Access and Control in Makerspaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432914,"makerspaces have complex access control requirements and are increasingly protected through digital access control mechanisms (e.g., keycards, transponders). however, it remains unclear how space administrators craft access control policies, how existing technical infrastructures support and fall short of access needs, and how these access control policies impact end-users in a makerspace. we bridge this gap through a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder study. specifically, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with makerspace administrators across the u.s. along with a survey of 48 makerspace end-users. we found four factors influenced administrators' construction of access control policies: balancing safety versus access; logistics; prior experience; and, the politics of funding. moreover, administrators often made situational exceptions to their policies: e.g., during demand spikes, to maintain a good relationship with their staff, and if they trusted the user(s) requesting an exception. conversely, users expressed frustration with the static nature of access control policies, wishing for negotiability and for social nuance to be factored into access decisions. the upshot is that existing mechanisms for access control in makerspaces are often inappropriately static and socially unaware. we conducted a mixed-methods, multi-stakeholder investigation into how makerspace administrators construct, refine, and make exceptions to access control policies, and how those policies impact end-user experiences. specifically, we conducted a semi-structured interview with 16 makerspace administrators and a survey with 48 makerspace end-users. we found makerspace administrators were forced to craft and constantly refine static access control policies based on four dynamic and contextually-sensitive factors: safety, logistics, experience and funding. owing to these dynamic inputs and static outputs, administrators often had to make exceptions to their policies to account for social considerations (e.g., their trust in certain end-users and their desire to maintain a good working relationship with staff). we also found end-users expressed frustration with the static and binary nature of existing access control mechanisms in makerspaces, yearning for systems more socially and contextually aware. finally, we proposed a number of design opportunities for the development of novel access control systems for shared physical spaces.",1022
"""It's all about conversation"": Challenges and Concerns of Faculty and Students in the Arts, Humanities, and the Social Sciences about Education at Scale",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432915,"as colleges and universities continue their commitment to increasing access to higher education through offering education online and at scale, attention on teaching open-ended subjects online and at scale, mainly the arts, humanities, and the social sciences, remains limited. while existing work in scaling open-ended courses primarily focuses on the evaluation and feedback of open-ended assignments, there is a lack of understanding of how to effectively teach open-ended, university-level courses at scale. to better understand the needs of teaching large-scale, open-ended courses online effectively in a university setting, we conducted a mixed-methods study with university instructors and students, using surveys and interviews, and identified five critical pedagogical elements that distinguish the teaching and learning experiences in an open-ended course from that in a non-open-ended course. an overarching theme for the five elements was the need to support students' self-expression. we further uncovered open challenges and opportunities when incorporating the five critical pedagogical elements into large-scale, open-ended courses online in a university setting, and suggested six future research directions: (1) facilitate in-depth conversations, (2) create a studio-friendly environment, (3) adapt to open-ended assessment, (4) scale individual open-ended feedback, (5) establish trust for self-expression, and (6) personalize instruction and harness the benefits of student diversity. our work is the first to systematically compare differences in teaching open-ended and non-openended courses in a university setting, and identify concerns that instructors and students have about scaling open-ended classes online in the arts, humanities and social sciences. our mixed-methods study, incorporating surveys of instructors and students, and semi-structured instructor interviews, identifies five critical pedagogy elements that instructors valued as necessary in open-ended courses, but not as necessary or applicable for non-open-ended courses. an overarching theme for the five elements was the need to support students’ self-expression in open-ended courses. we further uncover the open challenges and opportunities for incorporating these pedagogical elements that support effective teaching of open-ended courses at scale and online in a university setting. finally, we suggest six future research directions based on the open challenges and opportunities: (1) facilitate in-depth conversations, (2) create a studio-friendly environment, (3) adapt to open-ended assessment, (4) scale individual open-ended feedback, (5) establish trust for self-expression, and (6) personalize instruction and harness the benefits of student diversity. we conducted this study during april–december 2019, before the covid-19 pandemic. the outbreak resulted in a forced mass migration to online pedagogy [85]. experience with online pedagogy will likely increase after spring 2020. we hope this work provides guidance to instructors as they migrate their university-level open-ended courses to online environments, and to those who hope to increase accessibility to higher-education via offering high-quality open-ended courses in a learning-at-scale environment in the future.",1023
"The Situated, Relational, and Evolving Nature of Epilepsy Diagnosis",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432916,"an understanding of medical diagnosis as it is practiced is essential for those seeking to support it using intelligent systems. through the case of epilepsy, we show that diagnosis is a situated, relational, and evolving process that accounts for information well beyond the patient's physiology, even for physiological phenomena like seizures. through observations and interviews with neurologists, we show that the meaning of brainwaves and other physiological data depends upon a range of patient-specific and contextual factors, such as age, comorbidities, and mealtimes. further, we show that diagnosis is partly determined by social factors such as the activities of caregivers and other clinicians, and environmental factors such as faulty electrical wiring. additionally, diagnostic classifications can evolve in response to new information: events that were once considered seizures can be reinterpreted as clinically irrelevant and vice versa. we contribute a broader sociotechnical perspective to literature on intelligent decision making in healthcare and discuss implications for the design of decision support systems that can better support the work of medical diagnosis. how are epileptic seizures diagnosed in everyday clinical practice, and what implications might this have for decision support systems? to answer these questions, we conducted observations and interviews with neurologists in a large research and teaching hospital in the midwestern region of the united states. we found that medical decision-making accounts for information well beyond the patient’s current physiology, even for physiological phenomena like seizures. in particular, social and contextual factors—such as whether the patient is eating, where a caregiver is seated, and whether the electrical wiring is faulty—are crucial to seizure diagnosis. further, seizures are diagnosed in relation to patient-specific, contextual, relational, and evolving understandings of normal activity and noise. finally, diagnostic interpretations remain open to revision long past their original date of recording, and so a seizure can be reclassified as non-seizure and vice versa. diagnostic revisions are not formally tracked and new diagnoses are implicitly understood to reshape interpretations of older data. our findings contradict common assumptions in intelligent decision support systems, so we conclude by calling for systems that make room for expansive understandings of diagnosis as a situated, relational, and evolving process.",1024
"""Pick Someone Who Can Kick Your Ass"" - Moneywork in Financial Third Party Access",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432917,"this paper explores some of the new possibilities for financial third party access that are enabled by ""open banking"". the term open banking is used to designate the availability of banks' customer data through application programming interfaces (apis). financial third party access refers to the mechanisms that facilitate the engagement of others in the management of our personal finances. engaging trusted others in personal finances may be especially valuable for individuals experiencing financial hardship or life circumstances that place their financial stability at risk. we deployed a new third party access tool enabled by the uk open banking apis for 90 days with 14 people who self-identified as living with a mental health condition. the tool, which was developed by a financial technology startup founded by the second author, allowed participants to select a trusted ""ally"" who was notified when certain transactions took place in participants' bank accounts. during the deployment, the 14 participants and 8 of their ""allies"" took part in a diary study and pre- and post-deployment interviews. the experiences of our participants reveal the inadequacy and shortcomings of existing formal third party access mechanisms, and the moneywork involved in financial third party access. we argue that focusing on this moneywork can help us design flexible, proportionate and practice-sensitive services for financial third party access that move beyond discourses of protection and control in order to enable meaningful financial collaboration. in this paper, we have explored the moneywork involved in granting others access to our finances in order to enable support with money management. we have demonstrated, through the toucan example, how the opening up of banking data to external services can contribute to the development of new financial third party access mechanisms. we have shown the value of designing those mechanisms with a focus on moneywork, and emphasised the importance of moving beyond protection and control in order to enable meaningful financial collaboration. financial third party access services face the difficult task of striking a balance between autonomy and protection [25]. designers can contribute to this challenge by deploying practice-sensitive approaches that start from people’s situated actions.",1025
Personalised Services in Social Situations: Principal-Agent Relationships in Account Sharing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432918,"we present a qualitative study of how personal accounts on online services, such as tinder, netflix and spotify, may be shared in particular social situations. we draw from agency theory's focus on principal-agent relationships and goffman's work on frames in analysing situations where others are allowed to use personal accounts, either for a shared purpose or on behalf of the account owner. we deploy goffman's concepts of regrounding to understand how interests behind activities are transformed and brackets to draw attention to the boundaries of different frames, and how these are incurred or broken in situations that exceed personal account use. based on a set of 43 written descriptions of account sharing, we depict how employing others to act as agents to use one's personal accounts may lead to playful or serious use. additionally, we discuss consequentiality of sharing personalised services, considering both what services might reveal about the account owner and how sharing takes place in the context of relationships. we contribute by illustrating how users' relationships with personalised services are complicated by the different interests that are served when accounts are shared. we have presented a study of how personal accounts on online services — primarily tinder, netflix and spotify — are shared in both co-located social situations and as a part of ongoing social relationships. theoretically, we connect agency theory with frame analysis by incorporating goffman’s idea of an answer to what is going on, while also drawing attention to the question of whose or what interests are being served. attending to principal–agent relationships, that is, the tendency and capability to take on different principals and act for their interests, complicates understandings of the mundane uses of personalised services. these services are built to serve the interests of an individual user but these account owners sometimes allow others to use the service on their behalf or use their account to serve others’ interests. in these situations, the service may inadvertently disclose information that the account owner would prefer not to share. moreover, acts of sharing might also have an impact on later, individual engagements with the service, depending on how effectively sharing episodes are bracketed out. connecting to the longstanding discussion within cscw on how the position of a user is constructed and how it matches with use-in-practice, our findings illustrate that users’ relationships with personalised services are often complicated by the different principal–agent relationships that they are involved in.",1026
How Developers Talk About Personal Data and What It Means for User Privacy: A Case Study of a Developer Forum on Reddit,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432919,"while online developer forums are major resources of knowledge for application developers, their roles in promoting better privacy practices remain underexplored. in this paper, we conducted a qualitative analysis of a sample of 207 threads (4772 unique posts) mentioning different forms of personal data from the /r/androiddev forum on reddit. we started with bottom-up open coding on the sampled posts to develop a typology of discussions about personal data use and conducted follow-up analyses to understand what types of posts elicited in-depth discussions on privacy issues or mentioned risky data practices. our results show that android developers rarely discussed privacy concerns when talking about a specific app design or implementation problem, but often had active discussions around privacy when stimulated by certain external events representing new privacy-enhancing restrictions from the android operating system, app store policies, or privacy laws. developers often felt these restrictions could cause considerable cost yet fail to generate any compelling benefit for themselves. given these results, we present a set of suggestions for android os and the app store to design more effective methods to enhance privacy, and for developer forums(e.g., /r/androiddev) to encourage more in-depth privacy discussions and nudge developers to think more about privacy. we present a qualitative study of /r/androiddev, a popular subforum on reddit focused on android development. we studied how developers discussed personal data use and privacy using bottom-up open coding on sampled posts to develop a typology of discussions about personal data use and then conducted follow-up analyses to understand what types of posts elicited in-depth discussions on privacy issues or mentioned risky data practices. we found that developers rarely discussed privacy issues in personal data use unless stimulated by external events such as new system api designed for privacy, new app store policy updates, privacy laws, and user reviews (mostly negative reviews) about personal data use. we also found that developers frequently mentioned risky data practices related to specific app development activities but rarely discussed the potential privacy issues or how to address these issues. with our findings, we provide a set of suggestions for related stakeholders including android os, app store, and the developer forum to promote better privacy practices and encourage app developers to think more about privacy during app development.",1027
Learning from Family Mysteries: Accounting for Untold Stories in Family Memory Practices,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432920,"given the importance and social significance of passing down family stories to each generation, why do important family stories not get told? how should designers of digital family storytelling platforms address missing or incomplete parts of narratives? drawing from the results of an interview-based, practice-oriented inquiry, we argue that non-telling should be considered an important and integral part of family storytelling. our findings show that non-telling is not simply silence. non-telling allows family members to observe protective and discretionary values essential to the identity-making and relational goals of family storytelling. we also show ways that a person's reticence is situated and may change over time. in our discussion, we provide design strategies for family storytelling technologies to make room for silence and incorporate the values, purposes, and practices of non-telling. in this paper, we presented an argument for consider ""non-telling"" as an important component of storytelling in co-constructing the collective memory of families. leaving a story untold, with key details missing, or only available to a select listener enables a storyteller to enact personal and family values related to their identity and care for other family members. family memory technologies should not conflate non-use of the system with non-telling. non-telling is a form of active participation in collective storytelling. therefore, including non-telling as a practice is essential for family memory technologies to fully support intergenerational storytelling, where stories are passed down over time and mediated through networks of artifacts and people. to complement existing work on the capture, preservation, and sharing of family stories, we outlined strategies for design to make room for silence, enable protective discretion, find the right time, and distinguish non-telling from missed opportunities.",1028
"To Plan or Not to Plan? A Mixed-Methods Diary Study Examining When, How and Why Knowledge Work Planning is Inaccurate",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432921,"reliable and accurate planning is essential for modern knowledge workers. however, there is limited insight about when, how and why planning is inaccurate, and the circumstances in which those inaccuracies are troublesome. to investigate this, we asked 20 academics to keep a diary for a single work day. they estimated the duration of the tasks they wanted to achieve at the start of the day and noted down in detail the tasks they actually achieved during the day. semi-structured interviews were conducted to complement this diary data. the diaries showed that some tasks, such as email and coding, were more susceptible to time underestimation bias while other tasks, such as writing and planning, were more susceptible to time overestimation bias in planning. based on interviews, a typology of common reasons for delays in planned daily work is presented. it suggests that vague and optimistic planning leads to the observed discrepancy between planned and actual work. finally, interviews suggested that participants adopted four planning strategies that vary in the frequency of planning, from minimal planning to daily, weekly and multi-level planning. we close by discussing ways support systems for accurate planning can be better designed for different use cases. the aim of this study was to investigate how, when and why knowledge work planning is inaccurate. the results showed that in general planning was not accurate because it was overly optimistic. participants expected to work one hour longer than they did and 34% of planned work was not completed on the same day. a closer look at the data showed that different type of tasks were associated with a different magnitude of time estimation bias. this observation suggested that in the long-run writing, planning and decision-making tasks are less likely to be done to the standard they were planned due to delays in other information work tasks, such as emails. interviews suggested that most of the types of delays could be categorised as planning failures as opposed to external interruptions. therefore, we suggest that accuracy in planning for some groups of knowledge workers is achievable. further, the results showed that participants chose planning strategies requiring different levels of time estimation skill depending on the nature of participants’ workload. we hence offered implications for planning support systems aimed at different use cases. we hope that this paper can stimulate a renewed focus on accurate planning informed by the understanding that for some groups of knowledge workers accurate time estimations are a needed improvement to their workdays.",1029
What Makes People Join Conspiracy Communities?: Role of Social Factors in Conspiracy Engagement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432922,"widespread conspiracy theories, like those motivating anti-vaccination attitudes or climate change denial, propel collective action, and bear society-wide consequences. yet, empirical research has largely studied conspiracy theory adoption as an individual pursuit, rather than as a socially mediated process. what makes users join communities endorsing and spreading conspiracy theories? we leverage longitudinal data from 56 conspiracy communities on reddit to compare individual and social factors determining which users join the communities. using a quasi-experimental approach, we first identify 30k future conspiracists?(fc) and30k matched non-conspiracists?(nc). we then provide empirical evidence of the importance of social factors across six dimensions relative to the individual factors by analyzing 6 million reddit comments and posts. specifically, in social factors, we find that dyadic interactions with members of the conspiracy communities and marginalization outside of the conspiracy communities are the most important social precursors to conspiracy joining-even outperforming individual factor baselines. our results offer quantitative backing to understand social processes and echo chamber effects in conspiratorial engagement, with important implications for democratic institutions and online communities. currently, our understanding of social factors in conspiracy adoption is patched together by mainly theoretical and very few empirical studies. this work calls into attention the importance of systematically studying how interactions with conspiracists can influence the user’s joining into the conspiracy communities. using a theory driven framework of social factors across six dimensions, we perform a retrospective case control study of future conspiracists and compare them with non conspiracists. we not only find that the social factors are important but that conspiracy joining can be explained at least partially by at least one feature in each group. given these findings, we offer a unique, empirically backed perspective on the life-cycle of conspiracists, echo chambers in conspiracy communities and the effect of social exclusion in conspiracy engagement.",1030
Daughters of Men: Saudi Women's Sociotechnical Agency Practices in Addressing Domestic Abuse,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432923,"while domestic abuse is an all too common experience for women worldwide, how people experience the abuse and their resources to deal with the abuse differ. in this qualitative, interview-based study, we examine saudi women's domestic safety concerns living in saudi arabia and the united states. based on non-western islamic feminist views of agency, we identify three key practices, focused on how women resist or deal with their domestic violence. for each practice, we highlight how interwoven cultural, religious, and political contexts impact saudi women's ability to recognize and deal with domestic abuse. we attend to technology's role in enabling or hindering women's agency. these practices include: 1) recognizing abuse, where women identify abusive situations, 2) managing abuse, where women find ways to cope with ongoing or anticipated abuse within their constraints and resources, and 3) seeking non-abusive futures, where women decide how to mitigate the abuse or leave their abuser. given domestic violence's complicated nature, we highlight several key design recommendations based on women's values. in this study, we investigated saudi women’s understanding of and experience with domestic abuse, their agency practices in mitigating the abuse, and the role of technology in those practices. we found that leaving an abusive situation was not common. rather, saudi women build their resilience and find ways to work within their constraints. women also used mediation of family members, community leaders, and professional services to reconcile with the abuser or to remove them from the situation. our participants used icts including social media to stay updated with laws and regulations through official accounts, mobile applications to stay informed about legal rights, and referred to educational content to strengthen their resilience. based on our findings, we proposed design implications to empower women from within the existing sociocultural fabric of saudi arabia by focusing on designing for their values. in particular, we make recommendations for the design of technologies that support the values of religious piety, social cohesion and agency, and patience and resiliency.",1031
ProtoChat: Supporting the Conversation Design Process with Crowd Feedback,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432924,"similar to a design process for designing graphical user interfaces, conversation designers often apply an iterative design process by defining a conversation flow, testing with users, reviewing user data, and improving the design. while it is possible to iterate on conversation design with existing chatbot prototyping tools, there still remain challenges in recruiting participants on-demand and collecting structured feedback on specific conversational components. these limitations hinder designers from running rapid iterations and making informed design decisions. we posit that involving a crowd in the conversation design process can address these challenges, and introduce protochat, a crowd-powered chatbot design tool built to support the iterative process of conversation design. protochat makes it easy to recruit crowd workers to test the current conversation within the design tool. protochat's crowd-testing tool allows crowd workers to provide concrete and practical feedback and suggest improvements on specific parts of the conversation. with the data collected from crowd-testing, protochat provides multiple types of visualizations to help designers analyze and revise their design. through a three-day study with eight designers, we found that protochat enabled an iterative design process for designing a chatbot. designers improved their design by not only modifying the conversation design itself, but also adjusting the persona and getting ui design implications beyond the conversation design itself. the crowd responses were helpful for designers to explore user needs, contexts, and diverse response formats. with protochat, designers can successfully collect concrete evidence from the crowd and make decisions to iteratively improve their conversation design. the core value of our system is inviting the crowd into the conversation design process to support iterations on chatbot conversation design. protochat enables rapid testing with the crowd and guiding the crowd workers to provide granular feedback on specific points of conversation. with the crowdsourced data, protochat provides interactive visualizations which help designers to make informed decisions.",1032
"Making it Work, or Not: A Longitudinal Study of Career Trajectories Among Online Freelancers",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432925,"online freelancing is growing rapidly. however, despite this rapid growth, we have a limited understanding of online freelancers' long-term experiences and evolution, or how online freelancing influences freelancers' broader career goals. to address this gap, we interviewed a set of online freelancers at two time periods, two and a half years apart. we found that long-term engagement with online freelancing involves a unique set of financial, emotional, relational, and reputational burdens that represent the overhead of maintaining an online freelancing career. we found that this overhead influenced online freelancers' participation and perceptions of online freelancing over time, as well as the strategies some freelancers employed to manage their careers. our findings further highlight how online freelance platforms can afford unique career development opportunities over a longer period of time, including career exploration and transition, entrepreneurial training and reputation, and skills transfer. based on our findings, we present policy and design implications to increase the sustainability and accessibility of online freelancing. online freelancing represents a new and increasingly important form of work, with enormous flexibility and precarity, independence and uncertainty, potential and challenges. through our longitudinal study of online freelancers’ career trajectories over a period of more than two years, we found that online freelance platforms afforded three cross-cutting career development opportunities: career domain exploration and transition, entrepreneurial training, and reputation and skills transfer. at the same time, a nuanced picture emerged of the unique overhead of maintaining an online freelancing career, the influence of this overhead on participation over time and the strategies freelancers employ to adapt. based on our longitudinal findings, we suggest a set of implications for future research, policy and design to help minimize the risks and overhead of online freelancing and support online freelancers’ career trajectories.",1033
Using Data to Approach the Unknown: Patients' and Healthcare Providers? Data Practices in Fertility Challenges,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432926,"medical practices have always been data oriented: healthcare providers decisions are based on data, both clinically generated and patient reported. with the increased use of patient-generated health data (pghd), other types of data are entering providers? practices and influencing patient-provider collaboration. we studied the use of pghd and its related data practices in the context of fertility, a health concern that is uncertain, complex, and data intensive. we interviewed 14 patients who are facing or have faced challenges to conceive and 5 healthcare providers specialized in infertility. our findings show that patients and providers use pghd in different ways but with the common goal of exploring 'the unknown' generated by the uncertainties of fertility. providers use patients? data in a rational protocol, aiming to identify possible causes of infertility and define a treatment course. patients use data in a much more emotional way, learning about their bodies while struggling with data interpretation challenges. by analyzing these data practices, we discuss the principles behind their differences and describe how they have individual benefits for each specific group. we then suggest that fertility technologies need to consider such principles, highlight the existing boundary between patients' and providers' data practices, and focus on bridging instead of merging them in order to facilitate collaboration and maintain their independent benefits. medical practices have always been data oriented. with the rise of pghd other types of data are entering these practices and influencing patient-provider collaboration. we studied the use of pghd and related data practices in the context of an uncertain, complex, and data-intensive health concern: fertility with the goal of conception. our findings show that patients and providers use pghd differently but with the common goal of exploring “the unknown.” providers use patients’ data in a rational protocol, aiming to identify infertility causes and define a treatment course. patients use data in a much more emotional way, learning about their bodies while struggling with challenges in data interpretation. we discuss that both these practices have benefits for their specific groups and that the principles that drive them should be considered and supported when developing fertility technologies. finally, we suggest that fertility technologies should aim to make the boundary between patients’ and providers’ data practices more visible so their practices can be bridged, facilitating collaboration when necessary and also maintaining their independent benefits.",1034
Narrative Maps: An Algorithmic Approach to Represent and Extract Information Narratives,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432927,"narratives are fundamental to our perception of the world and are pervasive in all activities that involve the representation of events in time. yet, modern online information systems do not incorporate narratives in their representation of events occurring over time. this article aims to bridge this gap, combining the theory of narrative representations with the data from modern online systems. we make three key contributions: a theory-driven computational representation of narratives, a novel extraction algorithm to obtain these representations from data, and an evaluation of our approach. in particular, given the effectiveness of visual metaphors, we employ a route map metaphor to design a narrative map representation. the narrative map representation illustrates the events and stories in the narrative as a series of landmarks and routes on the map. each element of our representation is backed by a corresponding element from formal narrative theory, thus providing a solid theoretical background to our method. our approach extracts the underlying graph structure of the narrative map using a novel optimization technique focused on maximizing coherence while respecting structural and coverage constraints. we showcase the effectiveness of our approach by performing a user evaluation to assess the quality of the representation, metaphor, and visualization. evaluation results indicate that the narrative map representation is a powerful method to communicate complex narratives to individuals. our findings have implications for intelligence analysts, computational journalists, and misinformation researchers. this paper presents an algorithmic approach to represent and extract narratives using narrative maps. based on a comprehensive survey of formal narrative theory, we outline a computational representation of narratives comprising eight elements. we used an intuitive route map metaphor to connect the elements, their metaphoric renditions, and their computational counterparts. building upon existing approaches of story extraction, we designed a novel optimization-based approach to extract the underlying graph representing a narrative map. in particular, we seek to maximize the coherence of the map, subject to structural and coverage constraints. using this graph, we then extract the main storylines and the representative landmarks of the narrative map. these help us characterize the major themes in a narrative. we presented a detailed case study following the coronavirus outbreak during its first month. we explored the major events and identified the major themes surrounding the outbreak. this extended example helped us demonstrate how an analyst could leverage our representation to understand the evolution of a narrative. next, we presented a user evaluation of our method considering three aspects: the narrative representation itself, the effectiveness of the metaphor, and the usability of the visualization. while there are still some aspects that could be improved, our evaluation results demonstrate that our narrative map proposal fulfills its intended purpose. this work opens up multiple avenues for future research, such as adapting the current approach to another type of data (e.g., images) or to a different field (e.g., helping psychologists analyze personal narratives) or extending the narrative map representation by adding contextual information. in particular, incorporating measures of source bias and credibility into our representation could pave the way towards modeling how misinformation propagates in news narratives.",1035
How We Write with Crowds,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432928,"writing is a common task for crowdsourcing researchers exploring complex and creative work. to better understand how we write with crowds, we conducted both a literature review of crowd-writing systems and structured interviews with designers of such systems. we argue that the cognitive process theory of writing described by flower and hayes (1981), originally proposed as a theory of how solo writers write, offers a useful analytic lens for examining the design of crowd-writing systems. this lens enabled us to identify system design challenges that are inherent to the process of writing as well as design challenges that are introduced by crowdsourcing. the findings present both similarities and differences between how solo writers write versus how we write with crowds. to conclude, we discuss how the research community might apply and transcend the cognitive process model to identify opportunities for future research in crowd-writing systems. in this paper, we describe the design of crowdsourcing systems to generate original written text (called crowd-writing systems), through an analysis of 24 research papers and interviews with their authors. the analysis applied the cognitive process model of writing [16] as an analytical lens, which we used to group similar system designs together. in total, we identified 38 unique design decisions. our analysis found that the literature review included design patterns that relate to each of the writing components described in the cognitive process model, but our analysis also highlights design patterns that are specific to crowdsourcing. our findings suggest future opportunities for research, both in the analysis and design of crowd-writing systems.",1036
My Team Will Go On: Differentiating High and Low Viability Teams through Team Interaction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432929,"understanding team viability --- a team's capacity for sustained and future success --- is essential for building effective teams. in this study, we aggregate features drawn from the organizational behavior literature to train a viability classification model over a dataset of 669 10-minute text conversations of online teams. we train classifiers to identify teams at the top decile (most viable teams), 50th percentile (above a median split), and bottom decile (least viable teams), then characterize the attributes of teams at each of these viability levels. we find that a lasso regression model achieves an accuracy of .74--.92 auc roc under different thresholds of classifying viability scores. from these models, we identify the use of exclusive language such as 'but' and 'except', and the use of second person pronouns, as the most predictive features for detecting the most viable teams, suggesting that active engagement with others' ideas is a crucial signal of a viable team. only a small fraction of the 10-minute discussion, as little as 70 seconds, is required for predicting the viability of team interaction. this work suggests opportunities for teams to assess, track, and visualize their own viability in real time as they collaborate. recognizing the importance of team viability — rather than performance — in effective collaboration, we study signals of team viability in text interaction data of remote teams. our machine learning models using features motivated by previous literature can reliably differentiate teams that belong to the top decile, above median, and the bottom decile of viability scores. further investigation of the models suggest that while the use of exclusive language and second person pronouns are associated with higher viability teams across thresholds, other behaviors are unique to distinguishing the top decile, such as higher average reading level, and the bottom decile, such as sadness and displays of extreme emotions. furthermore, we demonstrate that the relationship between viability and team interaction is consistent over time, yet the pattern differs by de novo teams and reconvened teams. finally, we find that signals from the initial moments of interaction are sufficient for successful prediction of the whole interaction, which suggests that viability can be evaluated and acted upon early. the strength of our models using automated features indicate opportunities for real time assessment of viability, which lends further space for intervention.",1037
Conducting Risky Research with Teens: Co-designing for the Ethical Treatment and Protection of Adolescents,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432930,"the methods in which we study the online experiences of adolescents should be evidence-based and informed by youth. this is especially true when studying sensitive topics, such as the online risk behaviors of minors. we directly engaged 20 adolescents (ages 12-18) in the co-design of two different research methodologies (i.e., diary studies and analyzing social media trace data) for conducting adolescent online safety research. we also interviewed 13 of their parents to understand their perspectives. overall, teens wanted to share their personal experiences and benefit society, while parents wanted researchers to tackle a topic that they felt was a prevalent problem for teens. yet, they both had significant concerns regarding data privacy of the sensitive disclosures made by teens during such studies. teens' feared getting in trouble. participants emphasized the importance of developing a trusting relationship with the researcher to overcome these concerns. participants also saw the potential for using the research study as a tool for risk-reporting and mitigation, where researchers could act as liaisons between the teens and other parties (e.g., counselors, law enforcement, parents) to share pertinent risk details and facilitate resources or even help teens directly by giving them strategies for mitigating online risks they encountered during the study. our research delves into important ethical considerations for conducting risk-focused research with adolescents and uncovers the critical need for designing risk-based research for youth protection. we provide researchers with heuristic guidelines for conducting ethical research with vulnerable populations (i.e., adolescents) and keeping participants safe while doing so. we developed heuristic guidelines and a risk mitigation plan that move beyond existing ethical principles to consider youth protection for risk-related research. further, researchers must consider the tools they use for collecting teens’ sensitive information and optimize them for the target audience. therefore, we provide implications for designing technologies that engage adolescent participants by providing them control over their data and support for navigating risk experiences. we urge other hci researchers investigating sensitive topics with teens that involve more than minimal risk to prioritize the wellbeing of adolescent participants and use this paper as a resource to ensure the protection of youth. conducting risk-based research with adolescents often warrants teens to disclose highly sensitive information that may pose significant ethical challenges (e.g., legal liability concerns) for researchers. consequently, researchers often hesitate to take on such high-risk research, despite its importance and value in improving the lives of youth. as hci researchers, we have the responsibility to do no harm, but we have the equal responsibility to benefit the vulnerable populations we aim to serve. further, while this paper is specific to adolescents, there is potential for our overall findings to translate to research with other marginalized or vulnerable populations, who may feel or be at risk when participating in research, but still desire to benefit society through their participation.",1038
"To ""See"" is to Stereotype: Image Tagging Algorithms, Gender Recognition, and the Accuracy-Fairness Trade-off",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432931,"machine-learned computer vision algorithms for tagging images are increasingly used by developers and researchers, having become popularized as easy-to-use ""cognitive services."" yet these tools struggle with gender recognition, particularly when processing images of women, people of color and non-binary individuals. socio-technical researchers have cited data bias as a key problem; training datasets often over-represent images of people and contexts that convey social stereotypes. the social psychology literature explains that people learn social stereotypes, in part, by observing others in particular roles and contexts, and can inadvertently learn to associate gender with scenes, occupations and activities. thus, we study the extent to which image tagging algorithms mimic this phenomenon. we design a controlled experiment, to examine the interdependence between algorithmic recognition of context and the depicted person's gender. in the spirit of auditing to understand machine behaviors, we create a highly controlled dataset of people images, imposed on gender-stereotyped backgrounds. our methodology is reproducible and our code publicly available. evaluating five proprietary algorithms, we find that in three, gender inference is hindered when a background is introduced. of the two that ""see"" both backgrounds and gender, it is the one whose output is most consistent with human stereotyping processes that is superior in recognizing gender. we discuss the accuracy--fairness trade-off, as well as the importance of auditing black boxes in better understanding this double-edged sword. the current research highlights the importance of not taking ml-based systems’ output for granted. although cognitive services provide a convenient means for developers to enhance their applications and services with state-of-the-art capabilities, there is a real potential to carry any inherent biases downstream, thus impacting other users. likewise, researchers using proprietary itas to understand large-scale visual communication patterns on social platforms, need to be especially sensitive when processing images depicting people. through controlled experiments, we can attempt to understand and analyze the behavior of proprietary, black box systems, with respect to how they treat different social groups, and whether they do so in a manner that is consistent with human social norms. at the same time, it is important to appreciate that the behaviors observed during an audit may not translate fully to real world performance, where itas analyze images in the wild. following research in psychology, stereotypes drive the way people interact with each other, the assumptions people make of others and in some occasions, people’s future decisions for fulfilling society’s stereotypical expectations. there is enough evidence in the literature that social stereotypes make their way into cognitive services and that they are able to at least partly affect users’ perception. in addition, in extreme cases, itas can embody modern versions of physiognomy, a debunked victorian pseudoscience that has been experiencing recent rebirth [20, 99]. as such, auditing itas, both in terms of their training data [88] as well as their output, ethically evaluates the role such services play. we have seen that the cognitive services that were audited here, are not consistent in how they treat gender (men/women) with or without a social context. among those that were more consistent, clarifai “sees” more women and men when they appear in a stereotypically feminine or masculine context respectively, while amazon “sees” more men in that context and understands context in a better way when gender is perceived. as a result of the controlled experimental approach adopted in this work, we were able to capture evidence of inconsistencies – violations of the group fairness notion – by the cognitive services that need further research. the findings based on race were particularly notable, as both clarifai and amazon’s descriptions of images for images of blacks and asians were less stable, changing with the background context, as compared to others. the recent approach of google to remove gender-related tags from ita tag-sets, while done to mitigate social bias, does not provide a comprehensive solution to the underlying problem (e.g., [10]). service creators as well as developers who are using the services in their systems need to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all approach when comes to deciding on fairness versus accuracy. there are applications where gender inferences can be irrelevant and should be taken out, but there are also scenarios, like dating applications [54], where gender and/or race stereotyping can have a huge impact on someone’s life and well-being. therefore, auditing using multiple datasets is important for understanding the benefits and harm that a black box service might cause when deployed and real people are affected by its output.",1039

I Can't Breathe: Reflections from Black Women in CSCW and HCI,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432933,"in this paper, three black women in hci and cscw share their experiences of being black women academics enduring a global pandemic that is disportionately impacting the black community while simultaneously experiencing the civil unrest due to racial injustice and police brutality. using black feminist epistemologies as a theoretical framework and auto-ethnography and testimonial authority as both methodology and epistemic resistance, the authors exercise epistemic agency to testify to their lived intersectional experiences and the various fronts on which they fight to be seen, to be heard, and to live. additionally, they advocate for more inclusionary policies of black women and other marginalized populations within the cscw and hci communities. we conclude with a call to action for both communities to: 1) stand in solidarity with blacks in computing; and 2) acknowledge, disavow, and dismantle whiteness and oppressive power structures in the field of computing, specifically hci and cscw. given the history of oppression as it relates to the african diaspora, we must all educate ourselves about racism and power and acknowledge our role in each. what is happening here in our field is a mirror of what is happening in the world. however, because we as black women have heard it all before, sustainable efforts are necessary to invoke social change. at this moment in time, people of diverse backgrounds are empowered, posting their experiences and perspectives on social media and physically marching in protest in the streets as an act of solidarity. what can our allies do to stop the vicious cycle of racism at work within the cscw and hci communities? plenty! and in this paper, we emphasize a few concrete yet simple steps that anyone can do. additional steps outlined by other black people and white allies that are not mentioned in this paper should also be considered. in the words of one co-author, i can only think about and deal with what i’m feeling and experiencing right now. as black women, this fight takes an emotional, physical, and spiritual toil. what happens when the camera stops rolling and this is no longer front pages news? as black feminists and scholars, this is not a matter of choice for us. we are fighting for our lives, rejecting disingenuous acts (e.g., performative anti-racism, photo opportunities) that portray feeble attempts to address systemic racism. as a community of scholars, we must acknowledge the “wall of whiteness” [102] that exists within cscw and hci communities and dismantle the oppressive power structures that obstruct social justice in the field of computing.",1041
Explainable Active Learning (XAL): Toward AI Explanations as Interfaces for Machine Teachers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432934,"the wide adoption of machine learning (ml) technologies has created a growing demand for people who can train ml models. some advocated the term ""machine teacher'' to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge into ml models. this ""teaching'' perspective emphasizes supporting the productivity and mental wellbeing of machine teachers through efficient learning algorithms and thoughtful design of human-ai interfaces. one promising learning paradigm is active learning (al), by which the model intelligently selects instances to query a machine teacher for labels, so that the labeling workload could be largely reduced. however, in current al settings, the human-ai interface remains minimal and opaque. a dearth of empirical studies further hinders us from developing teacher-friendly interfaces for al algorithms. in this work, we begin considering ai explanations as a core element of the human-ai interface for teaching machines. when a human student learns, it is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from the teacher. when a ml model learns and still makes mistakes, the teacher ought to be able to understand the reasoning underlying its mistakes. when the model matures, the teacher should be able to recognize its progress in order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. toward this vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (xal), by introducing techniques from the surging field of explainable ai (xai) into an al setting. we conducted an empirical study comparing the model learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with xal, to that of traditional al and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without explanation). our study shows benefits of ai explanation as interfaces for machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model judgment and additional cognitive workload. our study also reveals important individual factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to ai explanations, including task knowledge, ai experience and need for cognition. by reflecting on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for xal, and more broadly, machine teaching through ai explanations. while active learning has gained popularity for its learning efficiency, it has not been widely considered as an hci problem despite its interactive nature. we propose explainable active learning (xal), by utilizing a popular local explanation method as the interface for an al algorithm. instead of opaquely requesting labels for selected instances, the model presents its own prediction and explanation for its prediction, then requests feedback from the human. we posit that this new paradigm not only addresses annotators’ needs for model transparency, but also opens up opportunities for new learning algorithms that learn from human feedback for the model explanations. broadly, xal allows training ml models to more closely resemble a “teaching” experience, and places explanations as a central element of machine teaching. we conducted an experiment to both test the feasibility of xal and serve as an elicitation study to identify the types of feedback people naturally want to provide. the experiment demonstrated that explanations could help people monitor the model learning progress and calibrate their trust in the teaching outcome. but our results cautioned against the adverse effect of explanations in anchoring people’s judgment to the naive model’s, if the annotator lacks adequate knowledge to detect the model’s faulty reasoning, and the additional workload that could avert people with low need for cognition. besides providing a systematic understanding of user interaction with al algorithms, our results have three broad implications for using model explanations as the interface for machine teaching. first, we highlight the design goals of explanations applied to the context of teaching a learning model, as distinct from common goals in xai literature, including calibrating trust, mitigating anchoring effect and minimizing cognitive workload. second, we identify important individual factors that mediate people’s preferences and reception to model explanations, including task knowledge, ai experience and need for cognition. lastly, we enumerate on the types of feedback people naturally want to provide for model explanations, to inspire future algorithmic work to incorporate such feedback.",1042
Better Feedback from Nicer People: Narrative Empathy and Ingroup Framing Improve Feedback Exchange,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432935,"online feedback exchange platforms enable content creators to collect a diverse set of design feedback quickly. however, creators can experience low quality and harsh feedback when using such platforms. in this paper, we leverage the empathy of the feedback provider to address both these issues. specifically, we tested two narrative-based empathy arousal interventions: a negative experience and a design process narrative. we also examined whether ingroup framing further enhances the effects of empathy arousal. in a 3x2 online experiment, participants (n=205) wrote feedback on a poster design after experiencing one of the intervention conditions or a control condition. our results show both the design process narrative and ingroup framing conditions significantly increased the feedback quality and effort invested in the task. the negative experience narrative condition had similar effects and participants reported significantly increased disapproval towards harsh feedback. we discuss the implications of our results for the design of feedback exchange platforms. the results of the experiment reported in this paper showed that the narrative empathy interventions, including reading narratives about a prior negative experience and reading about the design process related to the current project, and ingroup framing both improved feedback quality and increased effort invested in the task. when reading a negative experience narrative, participants reported a more disapproving stance towards harsh feedback and more likely to intervene if observed in practice. our work contributes new interventions that platform designers can implement to further improve the feedback exchange process.",1043
"""I was afraid, but now I enjoy being a streamer!"": Understanding the Challenges and Prospects of Using Live Streaming for Online Education",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432936,"the outbreak of covid-19 has led to a sharp transition from offline to online education in many countries and areas. this transition heightens the intensity of existing challenges of online education, such as student attendance and education equality. during this time of uncertainty, the vast disparities in teachers? online experience and technical backgrounds, students' education level and their families' economic status, and schools' support, further pose new challenges to teachers and students. in this work, we study how chinese teachers and students addressed challenges during this transition. we interviewed 15 teachers and 18 students from diverse backgrounds at varying education levels (k-12 and college). our work makes timely and new contributions to the literature of online education. for example, our results showed that teachers applied live video streaming (lvs) on multiple social media platforms and re-purposed different entertainment features to deliver online teaching for better student engagement; some teachers came to enjoy this new form of instruction after being resistant to it in the beginning, and students developed a better sense of intimacy with their teachers after experiencing certain online interactions. our work also reveals the remaining challenges and prospects of lvs-based online education and sheds light on the future design of collaborative technologies for online education. the social, ethical and technical aspects of online education have been widely discussed in prior work, but limited studies have discussed the application of live video streaming in online education, especially in a situation where there is no face-to-face option. our research explores the challenges, practice and prospects that live video streaming brings to online education. our findings show that challenges such as real-time interaction and engagement, technical uncertainty, ethical issues such as privacy and copyright, and impression management remain severe in lvsbased online teaching, which are mentioned in other ways of online teaching. however, live video streaming offers more opportunities for online education, including but not limited to increasing intimacy between students and teachers, and entertainment functions that promote participation. this mobile-supported approach helps to narrow the technological accessibility of students from different backgrounds when they transition to online education in this emergency, which promotes educational equality. our research can provide insights for scholars, system designers, and practitioners to address potential problems in the transition to online education.",1044
Socio-Spatial Comfort: Using Vision-based Analysis to Inform User-Centred Human-Building Interactions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432937,"a well-designed workplace has a direct and significant impact on our work experiences and productivity. in this paper, we investigate how office interior layouts influence the way we socially experience office buildings. we extend the previous work that examined static social formations of office workers by looking at their dynamic movements during informal desk visiting interactions. with a month of video data collected in the office, we implemented a vision-based analysis system that enables us to examine how people occupy space in social contexts in relation to desk configurations. the results showed that both social territoriality and approach path highlight social comfort in human-building interactions, which are different from efficiency or path optimization. from these findings, we propose the concepts of socio-spatial comfort: social buffers, privacy buffers, and varying proxemics to inform a user-centered way of designing human building interactions and architecture. this paper made an attempt to understand socio-spatial comfort with respect to spatial layouts in order to bridge the notion of social computing and human building interactions with a user-centered perspective, focusing on informal collaborations at personal desks. our preliminary study revealed that socio-spatial comfort is a type of tacit knowledge which can be captured by collecting and finding patterns from people’s embodied interactions in-the-wild. therefore, we proposed a vision-based analysis method to systematically capture the micro-physical movements of people who socially occupy the space over time, and visualize the outputs with different levels of focus (aggregated overview, temporal overview, path overview, and pose overview). by aligning the findings with interview results, we found that the occupant’s behaviours while approaching and interacting with people are not based on efficiency but vary at each desk configuration due to diverse aspects of social perceptions. these insights have driven our theoretical concept of socio-spatial comfort (social buffer, privacy buffer, and varying proxemics) to illustrate how the dynamic movements in the physical space can contribute to comfortable social interaction experiences. we argue that socio-spatial comfort can not be estimated simply by visibility-oriented privacy metrics [15], social territoriality [7, 96] or static proxemic distance [46]; rather it is based on the co-relational mapping between human social perceptions and micro spatial zones, which can be derived from real-world data. we believe that socio-spatial comfort could be an essential concept in designing comfortable experiences for human building interactions. understanding the key factors of these experiences can also support the adaptation of space layouts as well as designing pervasive environments, including intelligent objects (displays) and telepresence robots.",1045
"Body, Avatar, and Me: The Presentation and Perception of Self in Social Virtual Reality",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432938,"self-presentation in online digital social spaces has been a long standing research interest in hci and cscw. as online social spaces evolve towards more embodied digital representations, it is important to understand how users construct and experience their self and interact with others' self in new and more complicated ways, as it may introduce new opportunities and unseen social consequences. using findings of an interview study (n=30), in this paper we report an in-depth empirical investigation of the presentation and perception of self in social virtual reality (vr) - 3d virtual spaces where multiple users can interact with one another through vr head-mounted displays and full-body tracked avatars. this study contributes to the growing body of cscw literature on social vr by offering empirical evidence of how social vr platforms afford new phenomena and approaches of novel identity practices and by providing potential design implications to further support such practices. we also expand the existing research agenda in cscw on the increasing complexity of people's self-presentation in emerging novel sociotechnical systems. as commercial social vr applications continue to rise in popularity, how do these novel online digital spaces afford new forms of identity practices and embodied self? our investigation has yielded three key findings. first, social vr users tend to present themselves consistently with their offline identity, even when they sometimes construct platform-specific self-presentation. second, four aspects (aesthetics, gender, race, and age/maturity) are important for social vr users to perceive, approach, and interact with each other. third, the process of constructing and perceiving identity in social vr allow social vr users to experience their everyday self in a new way, discover one’s unknown self, or explore alternative gender identity. therefore, we suggest that the nuance of self presentation in social vr sheds light on 1) the potential of consistent digital representation; 2) a more complicated interaction dynamic regarding avatar representation involving the essential role of voice; and 3) new perspectives of the proteus effect regarding the body-avatar relationship and different levels of body ownership. based on these findings, we also propose three potential design implications for further supporting users’ self-presentation practices in social vr: avatar design for presenting cultural identity and gender identity; platform embedded voice modulators; and alternatives to full body tracked avatars. we believe that our focus on self-presentation in social vr contributes to cscw literature on social vr and nuanced self-presentation in emerging novel sociotechnical systems. we also hope that these insights and findings may inform potential directions for designing more meaningful, thought provoking self presentation experiences and identity practices online.",1046
A Dozen Stickers on a Mailbox: Physical Encounters and Digital Interactions in a Local Sharing Community,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432939,"many non-profit peer-to-peer exchange arrangements and profit-driven, multi-sided online marketplaces leverage underutilized resources, such as tools, to optimize their use to capacity. they often rely on a digital platform in pursuit of their social aspirations and/or economic objectives. we report on a field study of a local sharing community that employs a set of stickers illustrating different household items, typically placed on community members' mailboxes, along with complementary digital tools. the stickers are used to communicate the availability of resources among neighbors to facilitate social encounters and to encourage sustainable use and re-use of shared resources. through in-depth qualitative interviews with sixteen participants, we describe the opportunities and limitations of this approach to peer-to-peer exchange. we offer insights for designers of resource sharing communities into facilitating face-to-face encounters and the online interactions needed to support them. our paper offers two main contributions. first, it systematically describes the practices of one resource sharing community. we detailed members’ tactics for handling peer-to-peer exchange among neighbors, outlined interactional difficulties within the community, and examined how members use and make sense of the physical and digital tools that facilitate the sharing of household items. we also identified and discussed the challenges and opportunities of the pumpipumpe lowtech model in sustaining a sharing community over time. second, we elicited a set of design recommendations for resource sharing communities. these aim to maintain the delicate interplay among face-to-face encounters and digital interactions. we hope that this study inspires hci and cscw researchers to further engage in studying non-profit sharing economy communities and in designing systems that can better support their efforts to promote sharing cultures and to advance social, economic, and environmental sustainability within their environments.",1047
A System for Interleaving Discussion and Summarization in Online Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432940,"in many instances of online collaboration, ideation and deliberation about what to write happen separately from the synthesis of the deliberation into a cohesive document. however, this may result in a final document that has little connection to the discussion that came before. in this work, we present interleaved discussion and summarization, a process where discussion and summarization are woven together in a single space, and collaborators can switch back and forth between discussing ideas and summarizing discussion until it results in a final document that incorporates and references all discussion points. we implement this process into a tool called wikum+ that allows groups working together on a project to create living summaries-artifacts that can grow as new collaborators, ideas, and feedback arise and shrink as collaborators come to consensus. we conducted studies where groups of six people each collaboratively wrote a proposal using wikum+ and a proposal using a messaging platform along with google docs. we found that wikum+'s integration of discussion and summarization helped users be more organized, allowing for light-weight coordination and iterative improvements throughout the collaboration process. a second study demonstrated that in larger groups, wikum+ is more inclusive of all participants and more comprehensive in the final document compared to traditional tools. in this work, we designed, developed, and evaluated a process for interleaved discussion and summarization and a system called wikum+ that allows groups to collaboratively create a living summary artifact directly through the synthesis of their discussions. by interchanging discussion, where new ideas and feedback grow the conversation, and summarization, where consensus and synthesis shrink the conversation, resulting documents can be continuously refined. from our lab studies, we found that wikum+ allowed for greater organization and light-weight coordination in smaller groups, and more inclusion and comprehensiveness of the resulting document in larger groups.",1048
"Piracy and the Impaired Cyborg: Assistive Technologies, Accessibility, and Access",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432941,"this paper examines software piracy in the global south from an accessibility lens, using the bio-technical metaphor of the 'cyborg.' drawing on qualitative interviews with people with visual impairment (vi) from india and peru, the paper interrogates the intimate relationships that users have with assistive technologies (ats). it outlines the effectiveness of ats in allowing users to actively control and shape their own lives and identities, and describes the various modalities that regulate the human body, technology, and human body-technology linkages. the paper argues that software piracy, when looked through the lens of the 'cyborg,' is an act of self-making that is motivated by a desire to gain autonomy and independence, i.e., it can be understood as a way to overcome the barriers that undermine access to the technological self. further, software piracy allows a shift in the distribution of power from those who control and regulate the assistive technologies to the cyborgs themselves.",1049
Pulling Back the Curtain on the Wizards of Oz,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432942,"the wizard of oz method is an increasingly common practice in hci and cscw studies as part of iterative design processes for interactive systems. instead of designing a fully-fledged system, the 'technical work' of key system components is completed by human operators yet presented to study participants as if computed by a machine. however, little is known about how wizard of oz studies are interactionally and collaboratively achieved in situ by researchers and participants. by adopting an ethnomethodological perspective, we analyse our use of the method in studies with a voice-controlled vacuum robot and two researchers present. we present data that reveals how such studies are organised and presented to participants and unpack the coordinated orchestration work that unfolds 'behind the scenes' to complete the study. we examine how the researchers attend to participant requests and technical breakdowns, and discuss the performative, collaborative, and methodological nature of their work. we conclude by offering insights from our application of the approach to others in the hci and cscw communities for using the method. the wizard of oz method is used in studies of users with prototypical technologies that include some form of simulated ‘intelligence’. participants are not made aware of this simulated component, with the approach necessitating users be presented with a fiction on the grounds of methodical validity. we examined our practice of the method in the context of seeking to understand how users instruct a voice-controlled vacuum robot. the analysis in this paper does not just focus on ‘the wizard’, i.e. the person who covertly controls the simulated vacuum robot, but also how the method is collaboratively organised between multiple researchers ‘running the study’ and the participants. we identified how this routine organisation draws upon preparatory resources including a protocol and an outline script, and is rehearsed through pilots. these resources were used to scaffold and coordinate the actions between the researchers during the studies due to there being no opportunity for direct communication. in discussing our findings, we synthesised the methodological, performative, and cooperative work, identifying the on-the-fly nature of implementing the method as required by the experimental contingencies. we closed our discussion with insights for researchers and designers to apply the method and conclude that these experiments should be regarded as cooperatively accomplished trials, enabled by the preparatory resources and rehearsal, and underpinned by the methodological obligation to uphold the established fiction.",1050
Probing User Perceptions of On-Skin Notification Displays,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432943,"on-skin displays are emerging as a wearable form factor for the display of information; however, the perception of using such devices in public could determine whether they are eventually adopted or rejected. this study investigated the means by which on-skin notification displays are perceived by the general public. we adopted a mixed-methods approach to the analysis of results from an online survey (n = 254) and in-lab interviews (n = 36) pertaining to the novel form factor, device materiality, and envisioned use cases. the study was conducted in the us and taiwan in order to examine cross-cultural attitudes toward device usage. the results of this structured examination provide valuable insights into the design of on-skin notification displays for everyday use across cultures. this paper presents a cross-cultural examination of user perceptions pertaining to a color-changing on-skin display device. the first stage involved an online survey to probe first-person perspectives, and the second stage involved a lab experiment using an actual skindisplay device as a material probe to elicit first-person perspectives. semi-structured interviews were used to gain deeper insights into the potential usage of the device and its overall appearance. we identified a number of culturally-sensitive concepts applicable to the design of on-skin displays, such as the heightened importance of color in relation to the skin tone of users, and preferences towards the materiality and speed of notifications. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine societal perceptions of on-skin color-changing displays. as on-skin wearable displays become increasingly miniaturized, it will be necessary to uncover user attitudes in tandem with device development in order to create on-skin interfaces that are not only highly functional, but also considerate to broader social and cultural sensitivities.",1051
Unequal Impacts of Augmented Reality on Learning and Collaboration During Robot Programming with Peers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432944,"augmented reality (ar) applications are growing in popularity in educational settings. while the effects of ar experiences on learning have been widely studied, there is relatively less research on understanding the impact of ar on the dynamics of co-located collaborative learning, specifically in the context of novices programming robots. educational robotics are a powerful learning context because they engage students with problem solving, critical thinking, stem (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) concepts, and collaboration skills. however, such collaborations can suffer due to students having unequal access to resources or dominant peers. in this research we investigate how augmented reality impacts learning and collaboration while peers engage in robot programming activities. we use a mixed methods approach to measure how participants are learning, manipulating resources, and engaging in problem solving activities with peers. we investigate how these behaviors are impacted by the presence of augmented reality visualizations, and by participants? proximity to resources. we find that augmented reality improved overall group learning and collaboration. detailed analysis shows that ar strongly helps one participant more than the other, by improving their ability to learn and contribute while remaining engaged with the robot. furthermore, augmented reality helps both participants maintain a common ground and balance contributions during problem solving activities. we discuss the implications of these results for designing ar and non-ar collaborative interfaces. we conducted a mixed methods analysis of collaborators engaging in a problem solving of robot programming activities, in conditions where collaborators either used or did not use augmented reality technology as a systemic aid. overall, our observations suggest that the use of augmented reality in a collaborative problem solving environment has a positive impact on group learning and collaboration. detailed analysis showed that ar significantly helped one participant more than the other, allowing them to gain deeper understanding of learning content and contribute to the team collaboration. furthermore, augmented reality helped both participants remain balanced in their contributions during the problem solving activities. these findings suggest that the application of ar in problem solving environments could promote balanced collaboration in environments with unequal access to resources, and support group learning more generally.",1052
"""An Ideal Human"": Expectations of AI Teammates in Human-AI Teaming",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432945,"driven by state-of-the-art ai technologies, human-ai collaboration has become an important area in computer-supported teamwork research. while human-ai collaboration has been investigated in various domains, more research is needed to explore human perceptions and expectations of ai teammates in human-ai teaming. to achieve an in-depth understanding of how people perceive ai teammates and what they expect from ai teammates in human-ai teaming, we conducted a survey with 213 participants and a follow-up interview with 20 participants. considering the context-dependency of teamwork, we chose to study human-ai teaming in the context of multiplayer online games as a case study. this study shows that people have mixed feelings toward ai teammates but hold a positive attitude toward future collaboration with ai teammates in general. our findings highlight people's expectations for ai teammates in a rapidly changing collaborative environment (e.g., instrumental skills for in-game tasks, shared understanding between humans and ai, communication capabilities, human-like behaviors and performance), as well as factors that impact people's willingness to team up with ai teammates (e.g., pre-existing attitudes toward ai, previous collaboration experience with humans). we contribute to cscw by shedding light on how ai should be structured in human-ai teaming to support highly complex collaborative activities in cscw environments. previous cscw work generally focuses on human-collaboration and human-ai interaction, such as novel user interfaces [47] and using ai in daily work [60]. however, little work has studied humanai teaming. in this paper, we presented results of a survey and semi-structured interviews to explore people’s perceptions of ai teammates in human-ai teaming, as well as how people expect ai to perform. we found that instrumental skill was the top priority in preferred ai characteristics, based on both survey and interview results. following instrumental skills were preferences for shared understanding between humans and ai, communication capabilities, and human-like behavior and performance. we also investigated the factors impacting people’s willingness to team up with ai teammates. both people’s previous collaboration experience with humans and pre-existing attitudes toward ai were significantly related with their willingness to be involved in human-ai teams. additionally, we propose insights of human-ai teaming design for a better collaboration and coordination in human-ai teams. this work contributes to the cscw literature by providing an in-depth understanding of people’s perceptions and expectations of ai teammates, as well as factors that impact people’s willingness to team up with ai teammates.",1053
"Un Grano de Arena: Infrastructural Care, Social Media Platforms, and the Venezuelan Humanitarian Crisis",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432946,"venezuela is in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. in addition to food and medicinal shortages, violent crime has risen dramatically since 2014, spurring a mass exodus from the country. in order to cope with persistent material, informational, and digital infrastructural breakdowns that their friends and family in venezuela are facing, members of the venezuelan diaspora have turned to social media platforms to support people they left behind. through semi-structured interviews and participant observation, i uncover the ways participants form a critical infrastructure for people in venezuela. i describe participants' actions as infrastructural care --- infrastructural action as a form of caring for others at a distance through the ongoing management of resources, relationships, and infrastructures. infrastructural care consists of relational, negotiated, and dialectic actions that provide critical support while also generating ongoing tensions as participants are geographically separated from the crisis and, through their involvement, are forced to confront their own experiences of trauma. in addition to proposing the lens of infrastructural care, this paper contributes to our understandings of the ways people cope with an ongoing humanitarian crisis at a distance and how social media platforms fit in with wider ecologies of efforts. this paper documents how members of the venezuelan diaspora confront an ongoing crisis in their country of origin through infrastructural care (ic), defined as infrastructural action as a form of caring for others at a distance through the ongoing management of resources, relationships, and infrastructures. ic serves as a form of unidirectional care as participants, who are removed from the center of a crisis, continually act on behalf of those directly experiencing a crisis. while ic serves as a means of exhibiting and reclaiming agency, it is also stressful and draining as people must negotiate between various forms of distance, closeness, visibility, and emotional tolls. the sociotechnical phenomena of prolonged crisis are not fully visible in either acute crises or periods of privileged normalcy. for marginalized groups within western society and around the world, contending with ongoing breakdowns and crisis is a daily reality. while it is important to continually question how sociotechnical designs can better facilitate people’s efforts, we cannot forget that the actions of people and the connections between them will always be required to work within and across the gaps of multiple sociotechnical systems. rising global challenges and inequities demand our field adapt to situations of ongoing crisis more adeptly, recognizing the people at the center and peripheries of crisis and the ongoing ic work demanded of them.",1054
"""I can't get round"": Recruiting Assistance in Mobile Robotic Telepresence",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432947,"via audiovisual communications and a controllable physical embodiment, mobile robotic telepresence (mrp) systems aim to support enhanced collaboration between remote and local members of a given setting. but mrp systems also put the remote user in positions where they frequently rely on the help of local partners. getting or 'recruiting' such help can be done with various verbal and embodied actions ranging in explicitness. in this paper, we look at how such recruitment occurs in video data drawn from an experiment where pairs of participants (one local, one remote) performed a timed searching task. we find a prevalence of implicit recruitment methods and outline obstacles to effective recruitment that emerge due to communicative asymmetries that are built into mrp design. in a future where remote work becomes widespread, assistance through remote work technology like mrps needs close examination at a fundamental interactional level, taking into account how communicative asymmetries are at play in everyday use of such technologies. in this work we have closely examined the interaction between local and remote mrp-piloting participants working together in a collaborative search task, focusing on just how remote users recruit assistance from local participants. drawing on kendrick and drew’s framework of assistance recruitment in face-to-face settings, our explication of mrp-mediated assistance recruitment draws attention to the interactional asymmetries in mobility, perception and intersubjectivity that participants face. studies like ours that examine how assistance recruitment is achieved can reveal underlying nuances of the situation. for instance, are people comfortable asking for help, do they feel entitled to it? do local colleagues feel responsible to help? unpacking these processes can also highlight what barriers exist that make communication harder. a focus on understanding what communicative asymmetries exist can also allow us to asses not only what kind of help might be required but also how easily it can be recruited. as remote working becomes more common, it will be essential to ensure that remote workers using mrps are able to effectively recruit the assistance they need. in so doing, we need to be mindful that requesting help and receiving assistance may create imbalances in organisational structure. beyond the immediate issues that remote users face in assistance recruitment, questions of who ‘has to’ work in the workplace versus who ‘gets to’ work from home and what that means to recruiting help etc. ought to be considered in terms of how they may entrench structural inequalities. thus, a wider sense of a range of ‘re-balancings ’ may become relevant in the post-pandemic world of work. for instance, care should be taken, not only to ensure that remote workers can receive help, but also that doing so does not harm their position and how they are perceived in their workplace. to conclude with a more concrete take-away message for the cscw design and research community, we feel that there is scope for wide-ranging changes to reduce the impact of asymmetries for mrp users. these may range from improved features in the mrp, to providing information not just to remote users but to those local to the mrp to raise awareness of inequality issues, to campaigns on etiquette to inform the community, to developing tutorials for workarounds to alleviate the impact of asymmetries, to guidelines for considerate and responsible conduct around mrps. the cscw community is well-placed to conduct research to understand how to alleviate some of these problems arising from asymmetries, reducing imbalances and making it easier for remote users to request and receive help.",1055
Misinformation as a Window into Prejudice: COVID-19 and the Information Environment in India,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432948,"in the aftermath of the covid-19 crisis, there has been a massive amount of misinformation both related to the condition, and a range of linked social and economic issues. we present a mixed methods study of misinformation debunked by indian fact checking agencies since january 2020. alongside this, we present an analysis of what politicians in india have been discussing in the overlapping period. we find that affective issues dominate misinformation, especially in the period following the lockdown in india. furthermore, we find that communal prejudice emerges as a central part of the misinformation environment, something that is reflected in the political speech around the same period. researching misinformation when one is part of the cultural context can be a source of constant triggers, since one’s own identity is enmeshed in the misinformation discourse and what it represents. this work was often difficult for some of us, dealing with our own identities as targets of vicious misinformation. this is distressing both for the graphic content and its impact at the moment of engagement, but also because many artifacts are indiciative of how some of our fellow citizens may see us. there is much conversation right now on machine learning and fairness, as well as on the information environments it creates and recreates. while a large amount of contemporary work on misinformation is automated or semi-supervised, our work shows that misinformation is powered by innuendo, and its true impact is understood as part of the larger social environment it inhabits. here, the value of human annotation in getting at the deeper meaning of what is being said is critical. the ecosystem of hate that has been weaponized in india exists elsewhere in the world as well. the principal takeaway from our paper is that when the dominant or populist public discourse creates public enemies, in the form of certain populations or ideas, as inimical to the common good. these become the ‘usual suspects’ for sensemaking in any crisis. there no doubt are malicious agents trying to actively pin a crisis on such an enemy, and social media allows for this through organized trolling or campaigning. but as we see through the trends in affective and instrumental misinformation in this work, a point of equally important concern is the muddied information environment itself, and how citizens seeking to cope may be habituated to turn to rumors and hate speech at these moments.",1056
"Watched, but Moving: Platformization of Beauty Work and Its Gendered Mechanisms of Control",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432949,"women gig workers face unique challenges in on-demand platforms as gendered aspects of class, caste, and labor participation intersect with moments of control experienced on the job. through in-depth interviews with 19 beauty workers on on-demand home service platforms, we explore how the platformization of informal beauty work in india has ruptured dominant socio-cultural structures of control that have traditionally shaped women's mobility and access to work. this paper maps the ways in which women beauty gig workers experience and are impacted by algorithmic and bureaucratic management practices prevalent in the gig economy, in the context of home service platforms in bangalore. we find that platform control impacts lives in myriad ways, beyond the conditions of work. women workers negotiate their identities and sense of agency through the visibility afforded by platform control mechanisms. yet, despite these subversions, being on a platform does not fundamentally change the socio-cultural logic that restricts women's lives in india. these mechanisms work to entrench power asymmetries between customers and workers, as well as maintain them between the platform and the worker. this work shows how women service workers in india are under constant scrutiny from multiple sources. a range of social actors, from their families and communities, to employers and customers, monitor and discipline their bodies, behaviour, and actions. this study explores how the platformization of beauty services through the emergence of home service apps reconfigures women beauty workers’ experiences of control with not only the platform, but with other social structures as well. we document and unpack how women beauty gig workers identify and make sense of moments of control experienced on the job. but we also show how workers have agency, and that they actively leverage platform control functions to negotiate modes of familial and customer control. in this, our work pushes the limits of critical questions that will occupy us in examining the changing world of work. platforms, even if built in a universalizing mode to behave the same for workers around the world, cannot be studied in isolation from the gendered, cultural, and class realities of the settings where they are used.",1057
ShiSha: Enabling Shared Perspective With Face-to-Face Collaboration Using Redirected Avatars in Virtual Reality,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432950,"the importance of remote collaboration grows in an interconnected world as the reasons to avoid travel increase. the spatial rendering and collaboration capabilities of virtual and augmented reality systems are well suited for tasks such as support or training. users can take a shared perspective to build a common understanding. also, users may engage in face-to-face cooperation to support interpersonal communication. however, a shared perspective and face-to-face collaboration are both desirable but naturally exclude each other. we place all users at the same location to provide a shared perspective. to avoid overlapping body parts, the avatars of the other connected users are shifted to the side. a redirected body pose modification corrects the resulting inconsistencies. the implemented system is compared to a baseline of two users standing in the same location and working with overlapping avatars. the results of a user study show that the proposed modifications provide an easy to use, efficient collaboration and yield higher co-presence and the feeling of teamwork. applying redirection techniques to other users opens up novel ways to increase social presence for local or remote collaboration. we present shisha, a social redirection technique that allows multi-user collaboration from a shared perspective while at the same time providing a face-to-face interaction by shifting and modifying remote users’ avatars. taking the same perspective as another user leads to overlapping avatars. this breaks personal space boundaries and induces feelings of loneliness or surveillance as user feedback highlights. with shisha, avatar overlap is avoided as other avatars are shifted outside of the user’s own body. to compensate for the shift, the other avatars are modified to still reach to and look at the correct locations. a user study confirms that the shisha modification is easy to use and has an equal performance when compared to a user collaboration with a shared perspective and overlapping avatars. co-presence scores and user commentary indicate that the face-to-face interaction of shisha conveys the feeling of teamwork and allows to follow the actions of the respective other. the social redirection of shisha is especially helpful in the context of remote training or support but is generally applicable for virtual conferences and user guidance. our results indicate that although high fidelity user avatars might not be required for task execution, they benefit teamwork and contribute to a natural and comfortable conversation. future work will build on the validated benefits of a shared perspective with face-to-face interaction. we aim to increase the feeling of co-presence and avatar realism and re-evaluate the benefits of shisha. to achieve this, we want to increase the behavioral realism of the redirected avatars, e.g. using neural networks to synthesize movements [95] and provide a personalized avatar with facial expressions and eye gaze for additional feedback cues and comfortable communication. furthermore, we want to explore and extend the concept of social redirection, including vr-ar collaboration, three users or more, and other use cases (e.g. a more open brainstorming or design session).",1058
"For You, or For""You""?: Everyday LGBTQ+ Encounters with TikTok",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432951,"online communities provide spaces for people who are vulnerable and underserved to seek support and build community, such as lgbtq+ people. today, some online community spaces are mediated by algorithms. scholarship has found that algorithms have become deeply embedded in the systems that mediate our routine engagements with the world. yet, little is known about how these systems impact those who are most vulnerable in society. in this paper, we focus on people's everyday experiences with one algorithmic system, the short video sharing application tiktok. tiktok recently received press that it was suppressing and oppressing the identities of its growing lgbtq+ user population through algorithmic and human moderation of lgbtq+ creators and content related to lgbtq+ identity. through an interview study with 16 lgbtq+ tiktok users, we explore people's everyday engagements and encounters with the platform. we find that tiktok's for you page algorithm constructs contradictory identity spaces that at once support lgbtq+ identity work and reaffirm lgbtq+ identity, while also transgressing and violating the identities of individual users. we also find that people are developing self-organized practices in response to these transgressions and violations. we discuss the implications of algorithmic systems on people's identity work, and introduce the concept of algorithmic exclusion, and explore how people are building resilience following moments of algorithmic exclusion. our study presents a nuanced account of people’s everyday experiences with the algorithmic system tiktok. we found that tiktok’s for you page algorithm constructs contradictory identity spaces that are both supportive and also exclusionary. there is still a lot of work left to be done. for example, potential avenues for future work could examine content creators more closely, to gain a better understanding of their resilience strategies in the face of disruption. this work may address the content producing and identity routines of both human and technical actors on tiktok, future work may also address the impact of stereotypes on lgbtq+ visibility, such as the harms that these stereotypes may cause, or the tendency of normative stereotypes to reduce the visibility of non-normative gender identities and sexualities. because sociotechnical systems are constructed and reconstructed by the social and cultural norms of society, the continued study of people’s day to day experiences with such systems provides fruitful insight into the functions of these systems, as well as how they structure and restructure these societal norms.",1059

normalized learning gain, intrinsic motivation inventory scores, and system usability scores were not significantly different. however, regardless of the collaboration condition, women reported significantly higher levels of stress, lower levels of perceived competence, and less perceived choice compared to men. because computer science is a context in which women have been historically marginalized, we next examined the relationship between student gender and collaborative dialogues by extracting lexical and sentiment features from the textual messages partners exchanged. results reveal that dialogue features, such as number of utterances, utterance length, and partner sentiment, significantly correlated with women's reports of stress, perceived competence, or perceived choice. these findings provide insight on women's experiences in remote programming, suggest that dialogue features can predict their collaborative experiences, and hold implications for designing systems that help provide collaborative experiences in which everyone can thrive. remote collaboration has become increasingly common in industry and educational settings, with online courses and work becoming more prevalent due to growing technological capabilities. remote collaborations have unique characteristics and nuances from those of co-located collaborations, and to better support these endeavors we must understand how people experience and perceive their remote collaborations. it is important to consider how individual characteristics may impact these experiences and perceptions, especially to understand and support historically marginalized groups. in this study, we investigated the influence of collaborative paradigms on remote collaborative problem solving in the context of computer science, a field in which women have been historically marginalized. specifically, participants from a university computer science course coded in pairs, following either structured or unstructured collaborative roles, and we measured outcomes of normalized learning gain, intrinsic motivation, and system usability scores. there were no significant differences between the two collaboration conditions. our analysis with respect to gender identity uncovered differences in men’s and women’s experiences of the activity altogether, regardless of the collaboration condition. we found that women’s perceptions of their experiences differed significantly from men’s in several aspects. women on average reported more stress, less perceived competence in their computing abilities, and less perceived choice compared to men. these negative emotions may inhibit the comfort and success of women in the computer science field, and should be researched more extensively to best promote desirable interactions between collaborators and support women during remote collaborative programming. in that vein, we inspected women’s collaborative dialogues to gain more insight into their experiences, and our analyses revealed five important relationships between dialogue features and women’s outcomes: (1) women’s number of sent messages was positively correlated with their reported relaxation and competence; (2) women’s average words per message was positively correlated with their reported competence and choice; (3) women’s number of received messages was negatively correlated with their reported competence and choice; (4) the average words per message in women’s received messages was positively correlated with their reported relaxation; and (5) the average compound sentiment of the women’s received messages was positively correlated with their reported relaxation, competence, and choice. these findings hold important implications for the cscw community and for future work. for example, our study did not find a significant correlation between women’s own average compound sentiment and any of their outcomes. this result suggests that despite reporting lower levels of relaxation, perceived competence, and perceived choice, women may not have expressed these emotions and perceptions in their written messages. future work should delve deeper into the pragmatic and semantic structure of the dialogues, as this investigation may provide insight into the ways in which women are expressing themselves through their dialogue and problem-solving approaches. additionally, more research is needed to understand the structures and affordances that support all users during remote collaborative problem solving.",1060
"3 Stars on Yelp, 4 Stars on Google Maps: A Cross-Platform Examination of Restaurant Ratings",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432953,"even though a restaurant may receive different ratings across review platforms, people often see only one rating during a local search (e.g. 'best burgers near me'). in this paper, we examine the differences in ratings between two commonly used review platforms-google maps and yelp. we found that restaurant ratings on google maps are, on average, 0.7 stars higher than those on yelp, with the increase being driven in large part by higher ratings for chain restaurants on google maps. we also found extensive diversity i¬¬n top-ranked restaurants by geographic region across platforms. for example, for a given metropolitan area, there exists little overlap in its top ten lists of restaurants on google maps and yelp. our results problematize the use of a single review platform in local search and have implications for end users of ratings and local search technologies. we outline concrete design recommendations to improve communication of restaurant evaluation and discuss the potential causes for the divergence we observed. examining the two most popular restaurant review platforms in the u.s., google maps and yelp, we found that restaurant ratings on google maps are, on average, 0.7 stars higher than those on yelp. we observed that this increase is larger among chain restaurants than independent restaurants. additionally, we found extensive diversity in the top-ranked restaurants for a given metropolitan area between google maps and yelp. our study problematizes the use of a single, primary review platform as a source for ratings in local search technologies and point to corresponding design recommendations.",1061
Towards Building Community Collective Efficacy for Managing Digital Privacy and Security within Older Adult Communities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432954,"older adults are increasingly becoming adopters of digital technologies, such as smartphones; however, this population remains particularly vulnerable to digital privacy and security threats. to date, most research on technology used among older adults focuses on helping individuals overcome their discomfort or lack of expertise with technology to protect them from such threats. instead, we are interested in how communities of older adults work together to collectively manage their digital privacy and security. to do this, we surveyed 67 individuals across two older adult communities (59 older adults and eight employees or volunteers) and found that the community's collective efficacy for privacy and security was significantly correlated with the individuals' self-efficacy, power usage of technology, and their sense of community belonging. community collective efficacy is a group's mutual belief in its ability to achieve a shared goal. using social network analysis, we further unpacked these relationships to show that many older adults interact with others who have similar technological expertise, and closer-knit older adult communities that have low technology expertise (i.e., low power usage and self-efficacy) may increase their community collective efficacy for privacy and security by embedding facilitators (e.g., employees or volunteers) who have more technical expertise within their communities. our work demonstrates how both peer influence and outside expertise can be leveraged to support older adults in managing their digital privacy and security. in this paper, we have examined the capacity of older adults to support each other in digital privacy and security management through the exploration of community collective efficacy. our results highlight several factors that support community collective efficacy for privacy and security, namely individual self-efficacy for privacy and security, power usage of technology, and a sense of community belonging. overall, our results indicate that each of the constructs examined plays a vital role in supporting community collective efficacy for privacy and security and warrants future work to understand other factors that may help communities that have low self-efficacy for privacy and security and low technology usage. one important contribution from this study is the important role that community facilitators can play in providing technical expertise in these communities, as we observed with the employees in the residential community. based on our findings, we believe our framework for building community collective efficacy may be useful to investigate individual- and community-based impacts when implementing privacy and security interventions. in addition, our social network analysis approach can aid in the examination of the socio-technical environment that may be critical to the success of such interventions, allowing researchers to focus on participant’s relationships with others in their community. we contribute our work as an extension of the discussion on social cybersecurity and community oversight for privacy and security.",1062
Data Integration as Coordination: The Articulation of Data Work in an Ocean Science Collaboration,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432955,"recent cscw research on the collaborative design and development of research infrastructures for the natural sciences has increasingly focused on the challenges of open data sharing. this qualitative study describes and analyzes how multidisciplinary, geographically distributed ocean scientists are integrating highly diverse data as part of an effort to develop a new research infrastructure to advance science. this paper identifies different kinds of coordination that are necessary to align processes of data collection, production, and analysis. some of the hard work to integrate data is undertaken before data integration can even become a technical problem. after data integration becomes a technical problem, social and organizational means continue to be critical for resolving differences in assumptions, methods, practices, and priorities. this work calls attention to the diversity of coordinative, social, and organizational practices and concerns that are needed to integrate data and also how, in highly innovative work, the process of integrating data also helps to define scientific problem spaces themselves. this paper has investigated scientists’ everyday activities in navigating the various concerns of data integration. stakeholders experience a large number of intersecting concerns emerging from their disciplinary, mutual familiarity, and methodological, differences. researchers work to bring their data collecting, cleaning, and sharing efforts into alignment with downstream situations of reuse. in this process we highlight the various kinds of articulation work which must go on in order to construct lines and arcs of work for the efficient movement of data between situations, to match workers to tasks, and to bring essential resources into the relevant work site. we outline a number of ways in which a practice-based approach shifts our attention in the study of data integration, and, more broadly, of data sharing and reuse. firstly, it refocuses our attention towards the practices that researchers enact on the ground in order to navigate this complexity. secondly, it highlights the work researchers engage in to figure out how to integrate data, and not only their considerations of whether or when to integrate data. this moves us beyond a simple barriers/incentives model, and casts the problem of exchanging data in the sciences not as a system of walls that need to be knocked down, but a system of bridges that might be built. for the designer of data portals and other data sharing systems, this might mean moving away from large, top-down standardization efforts, and towards a situated design effort. this would involve looking for sites of collaborative practice where interoperations between data types, methods, and ways of working are already being hashed out for particular ends by researchers and widening these paths, rather than examining why data sharing is not happening in a given situation. finally, examining articulation work draws our attention to the processes by which new roles and divisions of labor emerge around the project of data integration between newly collaborating fields or methodological communities.",1063
Content Creation in Later Life: Reconsidering Older Adults' Digital Participation and Inclusion,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434166,"in increasingly digitalised societies, government initiatives to ensure that public services remain accessible for everyone typically focus on the digital inclusion of older adults. however, by solely viewing older adults as passive recipients or consumers of services, digital inclusion strategies under-emphasise the concept of digital participation. highlighting the importance of older adults as active contributors in a digital society, we investigated the potential of content creation to increase older adults' digital skills whilst also strengthening their digital participation. through a workshop and interviews involving three different groups of older content producers, we show that content creation can stimulate older adults' digital participation. we report on challenges faced by the content creators, including time constraints, lack of professional support and the preference to create content collaboratively. we propose that by facilitating collaborative content creation activities, local communities can better support older adults' digital participation and facilitate inclusion across different life domains. this research presented here explored the potential of using content creation as a pathway to enhanced digital skills in later life. it adds to key debates about civic participation in later life by focusing on participation in digital spaces to achieve civic goals. we show that by engaging in a range of content creation activities, such as radio production and online communications, older adults can engage more widely with digital technologies and develop their digital skills. digital content creation can also strengthen civic participation in later life and widen the reach of older people’s voices. our research highlights the importance of recognising older adults as active contributors in the digital sphere. these insights have implications for the delivery of digital inclusion strategies, leading us to propose a shift towards digital participation in later life as a means of supporting older adults to become more active in civic society. despite these promising examples of how digital skill development can happen through content creation, there is ample scope for future work to address this topic in greater depth. in particular, we need to consider contrasting examples, in which digital skills development might not arise from participation in content creation activities. future research should continue to explore barriers to digital and civic participation of a diverse older population. there is also merit in exploring in more detail potential differences between various means of digital content creation activities, how they are used by older adults and in which ways they contribute to the development of digital skills in later life.",1064
Online Community-based Design of Free and Open Source Software for Transgender Voice Training,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434167,"this paper describes project spectra, a collective of open source developers that aims to build free and open source voice training technology for transgender people. we demonstrate how a design prioritizing the agency of trans users was made possible through sustained community collaboration. using an autoethnographic approach, we discuss our community-based design process, which was documented with memos, online meetings and text conversations, sketches, and other data sources. we illustrate how we articulated our values as a group: deciding our programming framework (including a statement of principles), elaborating our ""experience goals"" (the feelings we wanted our design to elicit), and determining the features we wanted to implement in our app. we conclude with a reflection on the benefits and challenges of conducting community-based design research through an open-source organizational model. community-based collaborative design allowed project spectra members to work against dominant, agency-stripping gender norms. prioritizing agency in our app from the beginning, we supported users specifying and changing their goals at any time. within our organization, we intended to support members’ agency by fostering meaningful (and not mandatory) participation based on our own skills, interests, and backgrounds. we sought feedback from individuals outside our group, such as speech therapy practitioners, and recognized that they possessed unique training. however, we also did not elevate their knowledge above and beyond that of the broader community, especially if they hailed from a clinical institution. that being said, our work as a group was not immune to contradictions arising from my position in academia. this paper attempted to answer calls within hci for a “reorienting” and “restructuring” of pd, but more research on alternative working models is still needed. researchers can use established groupwork models – such as pd, foss, and cbpp – as methodological guides to design; we can then ask how we can (and should) work with others, and what design methods are appropriate in a given context. evaluative questions guided by feminist methodologies can reveal the relationships, habits, stories, and breakdowns that structure our design projects. this paper showed the importance of reflecting, via autoethnographic field notes, on the researcher’s own positionality and influence on the research. coleman [18] describes how open source software developers act collectively but reject “politics,” considering it a failed enterprise. conversely, it seems, hci researchers embrace political analyses and approaches but struggle to collectively challenge the oppressive systems that govern neoliberal academia. as a case in point, the academic context of this research, and my participation in it, sometimes benefited but ultimately hampered the extent to which our design process could embody a bottom-up and self-driven ideal. to address this issue, we must organize toward political, economic, and cultural shifts in the structure and governance of academic institutions.",1065
Towards Supporting Programming Education at Scale via Live Streaming,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434168,"live streaming, which allows streamers to broadcast their work to live viewers, is an emerging practice for teaching and learning computer programming. participation in live streaming is growing rapidly, despite several apparent challenges, such as a general lack of training in pedagogy among streamers and scarce signals about a stream's characteristics (e.g., difficulty, style, and usefulness) to help viewers decide what to watch. to understand why people choose to participate in live streaming for teaching or learning programming, and how they cope with both apparent and non-obvious challenges, we interviewed 14 streamers and viewers about their experience with live streaming programming. among other results, we found that the casual and impromptu nature of live streaming makes it easier to prepare than pre-recorded videos, and viewers have the opportunity to shape the content and learning experience via real-time communication with both the streamer and each other. nonetheless, we identified several challenges that limit the potential of live streaming as a learning medium. for example, streamers voiced privacy and harassment concerns, and existing streaming platforms do not adequately support viewer-streamer interactions, adaptive learning, and discovery and selection of streaming content. based on these findings, we suggest specialized tools to facilitate knowledge sharing among people teaching and learning computer programming online, and we offer design recommendations that promote a healthy, safe, and engaging learning environment. in this research, we sought to understand the benefits and challenges of live streaming as a new way to share and acquire technical knowledge. in particular, we aimed to position live streaming in the ecosystem of online programming education by comparing it to traditional video-based learning experiences. through in-depth interviews with 14 streamers and 12 viewers who regularly participate in programming-focused live streams, we identified the unique educational value live streaming provides due to its improvisational, real-time, and social nature. we found that these characteristics of live streaming not only lower the barrier to sharing knowledge but also allow the viewer to shape the content being taught while observing error recovery and workarounds they would otherwise miss in well-edited videos. live streaming thus plays an important gap-filling role in the rather crowded space of online learning technologies. nonetheless, our study also revealed a number of challenges users face in education-focused live streaming. in addition to a lack of features specifically designed to support learning in video live streaming platforms, streamers also have to deal with privacy risks and sometimes online harassment. drawing from our findings, we suggest better tools and strategies for leveraging the benefits of live streaming and mitigating the drawbacks and risks of participation. we contribute a critical examination of this young practice to the hci literature and several design directions to evolve live streaming platforms into safer, more effective, and more inclusive learning environments.",1066
Looking for a Deal?: Visual Social Attention during Negotiations via Mixed Media Videoconferencing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434169,"whereas social visual attention has been examined in computer-mediated (e.g., shared screen) or video-mediated (e.g., facetime) interaction, it has yet to be studied in mixed-media interfaces that combine video of the conversant along with other ui elements. we analyzed eye gaze of 37 dyads (74 participants) who were tasked with negotiating the price of a new car (as a buyer and seller) using mixed-media video conferencing under competitive or cooperative negotiation instructions (experimental manipulation). we used multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to extract spatio-temporal patterns corresponding to mutual gaze (individuals look at each other), joint attention (individuals focus on the same elements of the interface), and gaze aversion (an individual looks at their partner, who is looking elsewhere). our results indicated that joint attention predicted the sum of points attained by the buyer and seller (i.e., the joint score). in contrast, gaze aversion was associated with faster time to complete the negotiation, but with a lower joint score. unexpectedly, mutual gaze was highly infrequent and unrelated to the negotiation outcomes and none of the gaze patterns predicted subjective perceptions of the negotiation. there were also no effects of gender composition or negotiation condition on the gaze patterns or negotiation outcomes. our results suggest that social visual attention may operate differently in mixed-media collaborative interfaces than in face-to-face interaction. as mixed-media collaborative interfaces gain prominence, our work can be leveraged to inform the design of gaze-sensitive user interfaces that support remote negotiations among other tasks. collaborative mixed-media interfaces (e.g., skype and zoom) are ubiquitous in our daily lives, allowing us to instantly communicate and collaborate. despite the technological advances, these interfaces are still imperfect and narrow the communicative bandwidth compared to face-to-face interactions and research on non-verbal communication with these interfaces is sparse. here, we focused on social visual attention because of its instrumental role in effective collaboration by aiding coordination, communication, and signaling socio-emotional states. since traditional measures (such as summary statistics) cannot capture temporal dynamics, of social visual attention, we utilized and enhanced a technique called multidimensional recurrent quantification analysis (mdrqa) to explore spatio-temporal dynamics of social visual attention. we found that social visual attention in remote interaction partly resembles characteristics of face-to-face interaction. whereas joint attention and gaze aversion were two prominent patterns, mutual gaze was largely diminished. contrary to some findings from face-to-face interaction, social visual attention in our study was not associated with factors, such as gender composition and negotiation orientation. however, social visual attention was a powerful predictor of objective negotiation outcomes. these findings broaden our understanding of social visual attention in remote interaction with modern mixed-media interfaces and provide guidance for the design of next-generation collaborative interfaces.",1067
Divided We Stand: The Collaborative Work of Patients and Providers in an Enigmatic Chronic Disease,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434170,"in chronic conditions, patients and providers need support in understanding and managing illness over time. focusing on endometriosis, an enigmatic chronic condition, we conducted interviews with specialists and focus groups with patients to elicit their work in care specifically pertaining to dealing with an enigmatic disease, both independently and in partnership, and how technology could support these efforts. we found that the work to care for the illness, including reflecting on the illness experience and planning for care, is significantly compounded by the complex nature of the disease: enigmatic condition means uncertainty and frustration in care and management; the multi-factorial and systemic features of endometriosis without any guidance to interpret them overwhelm patients and providers; the different temporal resolutions of this chronic condition confuse both patients and providers; and patients and providers negotiate medical knowledge and expertise in an attempt to align their perspectives. we note how this added complexity demands that patients and providers work together to find common ground and align perspectives, and propose three design opportunities (considerations to construct a holistic picture of the patient, design features to reflect and make sense of the illness, and opportunities and mechanisms to correct misalignments and plan for care) and implications to support patients and providers in their care work. specifically, the enigmatic nature of endometriosis necessitates complementary approaches from human-centered computing and artificial intelligence, and thus opens a number of future research avenues. our work elicited patients’ and providers’ conceptualizations of their work in endometriosis care, on their own and as part of the patient-provider partnership. in comparing, contrasting, and synthesizing their stories, frustrations, and ideas, we confirmed that patients and providers are engaged in multiple arcs of work and their partnerships lay on shifting ground. because of the enigmatic and chronic nature of endometriosis, these arcs of work are compounded by additional challenges, and the partnership is particularly vulnerable to potential misalignments and misinterpretations among actors. our analysis uncovers such breaking points, and we propose a set of design implications to support patients and providers in their work in the context of an enigmatic chronic condition. because of the complexity of this disease, technology should enable patients and providers to construct a holistic and flexible view of the patient’s illness experience, facilitate individual and collaborative reflection and sensemaking, and provide functionalities to structure trial-and-error care plans and for explicitly identifying and correcting misalignments.",1068
Not Another Medication Adherence App: Critical Reflections on Addressing Public HIV-related Stigma Through Design,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434171,"people living with hiv experience a high level of stigma in our society. public hiv-related stigma often leads to anxiety and depression and hinders access to social support and proper medical care. technologies for hiv, however, have been mainly designed for treatment management and medication adherence rather than for helping people cope with public hiv-related stigma specifically. drawing on empirical data obtained from semi-structured interviews and design activities with eight social workers and 29 people living with hiv, we unpack the ways in which needs for privacy and trust, intimacy, and social support create tensions around key coping strategies. reflecting on these tensions, we present design implications and opportunities to empower people living with hiv to cope with public hiv-related stigma at the individual level. people living with hiv need and use medication adherence tools. however, there is still a lack tools that could help address the wide-ranging impacts of public hiv-related stigma on the hiv coping journey. based on interviews and activities with people living with hiv and social workers, we identified several challenges and tensions that make coping with public hiv-related stigma particularly challenging. we also discussed possible design implications and directions for future research, including the co-creation of technologies that could be customized to address stigmarelated tensions more holistically. we urge researchers in the hci and cscw communities to design beyond medication adherence applications and existing online platforms as they seek to minimize the deleterious impact of stigma in people’s lives.",1069

Speculative Data Work & Dashboards: Designing Alternative Data Visions,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434173,"this paper studies data work in an organizational context, and suggests speculative data work as a useful concept and the speculative dashboard as a design concept, to better understand and support cooperative work. drawing on fieldwork in a danish public sector organisation, the paper identifies and conceptualizes the speculative data work performed around processes of digitalization and the push to become data-driven. the speculative dashboard is proposed as a design concept and opportunity for design, using practices from speculative design and research to facilitate speculation about data?its sources, visualizations, practices and infrastructures. it does so by hacking the 'genre' of the business intelligence data dashboard, and using it as a framework for the juxtaposition of different kinds of data, facilitating and encouraging speculation on alternative visions for data types and use. the paper contributes an empirical study of organizational use of and attitudes towards data, informing a novel design method and concept for co-speculating on alternative visions of and for organizational data. we conclude the paper by listing a number of questions and considerations which future work can orient itself on the basis of: - in the context of a speculative economy and hype around novel technologies, try to take an active decision as to how the project relates to these conditions. - consider how speculation and hype might be used strategically as “lures” or “perceptual bridges” towards design projects and interventions. - when encouraging speculation, be aware of existing sociotechnical imaginaries around data and data infrastructures. - consider how such existing imaginaries may be disturbed, interfered with or remixed. - what might a “lure” or “perceptual bridge” for alternative futures for public sector digitalization look like? the fieldwork that forms the basis of this paper empirically pointed to organizational data being a source of stress for public sector employees. this data was uncertain in quality and purpose, it was associated with cutbacks, and its contribution to central aspects of the work was unclear. based on cscw, hci and sts literatures on speculation, the speculative dashboard has been developed as an intervention into the data infrastructures that support this perception of data. the speculative dashboard is intended as an exercise or design artefact which can help facilitate positive speculative data work: either as an exercise that can be done in groups or as part of a data infrastructure, connecting different parts of an organisation. it works by the juxtaposition of different types of data within a familiar visualization space, and also by creating different contexts of use focused more on collective discussion and deliberation. by drawing on speculative design and research practices, the paper has proposed the speculative dashboard as an object of speculation, but also for the promotion of a different kind of speculation. in a sense, this kind of speculation is akin to changing dashboards from devices that focus on matters of fact to things which are able to help in articulating matters of concern. we recognize that the paper might have taken on and engaged in co-design or participatory design together with the users who were present in the ethnographic study, but the goal of the paper has been not to co-create but instead to attempt to think up infrastructures that might help others co-speculate. we suggest participatory design to be a very valuable area for future research on the topic of speculation and data economies.",1071
Understanding and Predicting the Burst of Burnout via Social Media,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434174,"job burnout is a special type of work-related stress that is prevalent in our modern society, and constant burnout is extremely harmful for people's physical health and emotional wellbeing. traditional studies for burnout mainly rely on surveys/questionnaires, which have revealed several interesting findings but are of high cost and very time consuming. with the prevalence of social networking applications, we aim to re-investigate the burnout phenomenon in a novel perspective. in this paper, we collected a dataset consisting of 1532 burnout weibo users with their postings. based on the previous literature, we propose a number of hypotheses about what might be the burst signal of the burnout from the perspective of language, time and interaction. furthermore, extensive correlation analysis is conducted to investigate if these hypotheses are supported, which leads to a number of interesting findings. finally, we develop machine learning models to predict the burst of burnout based on extracted features and achieve a relatively high accuracy, which reveals potential implications in early-stage intervention. in this paper, we collect a number of users with job burnout firstly. then based on previous studies, we put forward some reasonable hypotheses associated with burnout and posting behaviors from three perspectives: language, time and interaction. furthermore, we extract dependent variables corresponding to hypotheses, and make the significance tests of these variables in the way of t-test and chi-squared test, thus we draw conclusions about which hypotheses are reliable. in the process of analysis work, we discover some valuable findings, which provides us a comprehensive understanding of job burnout from the view of social media . finally, we design models to predict whether user would get burnout next. our prediction experiments support our analysis conclusions and have a good performance of detecting the burnout burst with the recall score of 0.9467, the precision score of 0.6652 and f1 score of 0.7813.",1072
CrowdMOT: Crowdsourcing Strategies for Tracking Multiple Objects in Videos,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434175,"crowdsourcing is a valuable approach for tracking objects in videos in a more scalable manner than possible with domain experts. however, existing frameworks do not produce high quality results with non-expert crowdworkers, especially for scenarios where objects split. to address this shortcoming, we introduce a crowdsourcing platform called crowdmot, and investigate two micro-task design decisions: (1) whether to decompose the task so that each worker is in charge of annotating all objects in a sub-segment of the video versus annotating a single object across the entire video, and (2) whether to show annotations from previous workers to the next individuals working on the task. we conduct experiments on a diversity of videos which show both familiar objects (aka - people) and unfamiliar objects (aka - cells). our results highlight strategies for efficiently collecting higher quality annotations than observed when using strategies employed by today's state-of-art crowdsourcing system. we introduce a general-purpose crowdsourcing system for multiple object tracking that also supports lineage tracking. our experiments demonstrate significant flaws in the existing stateof-the-art crowdsourcing task design. we quantitatively demonstrate the advantage of two key micro-task design options in collecting much higher quality video annotations: (1) have a single worker annotate a single object for the entire video and (2) show workers the results of previously annotated objects on the video. to encourage further development and extension of our framework, we will publicly share our code.",1073
School's Back: Scaffolding Reminiscence in Social Virtual Reality with Older Adults,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434176,"social virtual reality (social vr) is an emerging technology that has the potential to support unique social experiences for groups of older adults. in this paper we explore the use of social vr to support group reminiscence, an activity that has been shown to have a positive impact on the lives of older adults. we developed school days, a bespoke social vr application that enables groups of geographically dispersed older adults to meet in a virtual environment to reminisce about their school experiences. we conducted a user study over the course of 5 months with 16 participants aged 70--81 to evaluate how school days supported reminiscence. in this paper, we focus on how the use of reminiscence scaffolding features in school days impacted on the older adults' ability to participate more fully in the reminiscence activities. our results illustrate the value of social vr for connecting older adults over distance, and contribute new knowledge of how virtual environments can be designed to scaffold reminiscence; how techniques such as 3d conversation starters and individual artefacts can be used to scaffold reminiscence; and how pre-recorded holographic stories (avacasts) can be used to introduce new perspectives and prompt self-reflection. we contribute five design reflections aimed at guiding the design of future reminiscence tools in social vr. in this paper we explored the potential for social vr to support reminiscence among older adults. we implemented school days, a social vr prototype that includes scaffolding techniques to support social reminiscence. in an evaluation with 16 older adults, we found that the design of the virtual classroom environment acted as a prompt to stimulate memories while allowing participants to project their own experiences onto it. in addition, our scaffolding techniques of conversation starters, personal artefacts and avacast holograms contributed to powerful experiences of social reminiscence and self-reflection for the older adults. based on the results of our empirical research, we contribute five design reflections that can inform future hci work on social vr based reminiscence applications aimed at older users. overall, our study stresses the potential for social vr to enable novel experiences for older adults as a contribution to healthy ageing.",1074
